# Manage players in Dynamics 365
When the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_solution](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-solution-md.md)] is installed in your Dynamics CRM, you can view information about the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-md.md)] users in CRM. Sort the list by the type of player you want to see in the list.  
  
 .  
  
## Match players in CRM  
 To make sure the players in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] get their points for delivering a KPI, you can match players to CRM users.  
  
 In CRM, go to **FantasySalesTeam** > **Players**.  
  
 In the **Active Players** list, click the player you want to match to a CRM user account.  
  
 In the **General** section of the player information, click **User** and lookup the CRM user to match with this player.

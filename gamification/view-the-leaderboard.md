## Find your way around  
 In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)], click **My Games** > **Leaderboards** to see the various rankings.  
  
 You can choose the game leaderboards you want to see and switch between the different types  of leaderboards.  
  
### Types of leaderboards  
 Depending on how the game is set up, you'll find the following leaderboards along with their KPIs and  prizes awarded to the winners.

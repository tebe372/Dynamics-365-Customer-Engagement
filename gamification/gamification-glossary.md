# Gamification glossary
For a quick reference, review the list of the terms most used in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](includes/pn-gamification-md.md)].  
  
## Security roles  
 Security roles are the permissions that individual users have in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)]. Commissioners specify security roles when they configure [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] or when the create a new game.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Understand Gamification security roles](understand-gamification-security-roles.md)  
  
### Commissioners  
 A Commissioner is considered to be a referee in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)], and is a user with the broadest permissions. Because Commissioners have insider knowledge about players and teams, they aren't allowed to participate in any games. [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] can be configured with more than one Commissioner.  
  
### Fans  
 Fans are employees whose performance isn't measured with game KPIs. For example, a fan might be an executive manager or a team admin.  
  
### Game managers  
 Game managers run games, keep players and fans engaged, and take care of administrative tasks like weekly email updates or point scoring, if done manually. For example, this could be a line manager of the player field. Game managers can optionally participate in games they don't administer.  
  
### Players  
 Players are listed in the a game and work toward business goals measured with KPIs which are used in the game. A user can be a player in one game and a fan in another game. For example, this could be a sales rep who closes opportunities, a service pro who solves customer issues, or a marketeer who generates leads from running campaigns.  
  
## Fantasy Sport  
 A type of online game where players and fans become fantasy team managers. Team managers assemble a fictitious team of real players that compete against other fictitious teams. Points for the teams are a sum of the points that the individual players score. In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)], points are awarded by achieving KPIs, usually scored directly from [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](includes/pn-crm-online-md.md)].  
  
## Game  
 Games are set up and run in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] to gamify KPIs that are tracked elsewhere. Sometimes also referred to as a "contest". There are different types of games.

- **Fantasy Teams:** Players can draft their individual fantasy sport team with their own team members. Due to several player features like team drafting and team manager awards, this is by far the most engaging game model offered in Dynamics 365 Gamification. This selection also lets you select from the available sports theme when you create a game.  
  
- **Fixed Teams:** To keep it more simple, a game manager can set the teams, such as Office A and Office B. Selecting this game model requires the game manager to specify well-balanced teams to keep players engaged. If a team significantly falls behind due to having all top-performers against them, they will likely lose interest and abandon the contest.  
  
- **No Teams:** Players compete individually, without drafting teams. It's as simple as that. Head-to-head, the winner gets it all.  
  
## Gamification (concept)  
 Gamification as a concept applies gaming elements and principles to  non-game contexts to improve user engagement and productivity, or promote activities and processes among others. Gamification strives to leverage people's natural desires for socializing, mastery, competition, achievement, altruism, or closure. Rewards include points, achievements, badges, cash prizes, tangible prizes or  company benefits.  
  
## Stream TV  
 Stream TV is a way to stream smack talk notifications and leaderboards from active games to an Internet-connected screen or TV in your office.

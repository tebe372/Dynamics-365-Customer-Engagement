# For Commissioners and game managers in Gamification
As with any software application, the tool itself doesn’t make you successful. It needs to be used and set up the right way to achieve the best results. Before you get started setting up your first game in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](includes/pn-gamification-md.md)] and start organizing a competition for your teams, there are a few things to keep in mind:  
  
 First things first -- you need to install the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_solution](includes/pn-gamification-solution-md.md)] app from [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_appsource](includes/pn-microsoft-appsource-md.md)] and make sure users have a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](includes/pn-crm-online-md.md)] license assigned.

 To prepare for your first game, familiarize yourself with the main concepts in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)], like game models, players, KPIs, teams, and user roles.

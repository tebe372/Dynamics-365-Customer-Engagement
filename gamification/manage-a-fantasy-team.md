# Manage a fantasy team
When you participate in a fantasy team game, players become team managers and can draft their own teams.  
  
 Once the Commissioner activates the game, you'll receive an email with instructions to sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](includes/pn-gamification-md.md)] and create your [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] profile. In a next step you'll be asked to draft your team.  
  
## Create a fantasy team  
 When a game is about to start, you'll be asked to draft your own team to compete for team manager awards.  
  
#### Draft your team  
  
1.  Follow the instructions in the initial email you received to [sign in](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830344) and create your profile in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)].  
  
     Contact the Commissioner if you didn't get the email. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](includes/proc-more-information-md.md)][Contact a Commissioner](contact-a-commissioner.md)  
  
2.  Click **Begin Draft** to start drafting your team.  
  
3.  Select a player for each position.  
  
4.  Click **Submit** to save the changes to your team roster.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  Team rosters are effective for the next game period. You can change your team roster as often as you like before the next game period starts.  
  
## Edit a fantasy team  
 Because games often span multiple weeks or months, there's a chance that some players will take time off for vacation, or some people might leave the company. With real sports teams, you wouldn't put injured players on the roster. Think along the same lines for your team roster in this game. Replace people who've taken time off or those who left with active players to keep your winning chances up.  
  
#### Edit your team roster  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)], go to **Teams** > **Team Rosters**.  
  
2.  Click ![Edit the team roster in Gamification](media/edit-team-roster-gamification.png "Edit the team roster in Gamification") in the **My Team** column to edit your team roster.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can only change a team roster after the first game period has ended.  
  
3.  Select a player for each position.  
  
4.  Click **Submit** to save the changes to your team roster.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  Changes to team rosters are effective for the next game period.  
  
## Compete with others  
 A contest is no fun without competition, is it? Check out how your team performs compared to other teams on the **My Games** page. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](includes/proc-more-information-md.md)][View the leaderboard](view-the-leaderboard.md)

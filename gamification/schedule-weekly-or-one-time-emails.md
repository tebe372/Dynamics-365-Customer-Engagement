# Schedule weekly or one-time emails
Send weekly updates on the leaderboards or announce award winners with scheduled email capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](includes/pn-gamification-md.md)]. A Commissioner or game manager can schedule weekly or one-time emails to be sent to any user involved in a game. This feature is particularly helpful to keep your players engaged if you don't stream the leaderboard to a screen in your office.  
  
## Manage scheduled emails  
 You can create, edit, or delete scheduled emails in the **Games** > **Emails** settings.  
  
#### Create an email  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)], go to **Games** > **Emails**.  
  
2.  Click the **Schedule New Email**  ![Add button in Gamification](media/add-button-gamification.png "Add button in Gamification") button.  
  
3.  Provide the basic information for your email, including **Name**, **Game**, **Frequency**, and **Recipients**.  
  
4.  Enter the **Subject** and start writing your email body text.  
  
     To embed a leaderboard in your email, select one from **Available Tags** to insert the leaderboard tag in the email body. Next, prepend the tag with the number of places you want to see in the leaderboard, followed by an underscore. For example, the top 5 Fantasy Team Leaders is formatted like this: `[5_FANTASY_TEAM_LEADERS]`  
  
5.  When you're done drafting your email, click **Save**.  
  
6.  Click **Send Test** to send yourself a test email to verify the content.  
  
7.  When you are satisfied with the email, click **Schedule** to activate the email schedule as defined in step 3.

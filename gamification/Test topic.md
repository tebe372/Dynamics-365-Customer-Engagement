# Before you get started
Here are some basic guidelines for game models, KPIs, awards, prizes, teams, player positions, and more. Familiarize yourself with these concepts to create games that works best for your business.
## Game models and sports themes
Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Gamification offers three team models for running a game: fantasy teams, fixed teams, and no teams. It also lets you create a leaderboard slide show that you can show on a screen in your office. For game model descriptions, review the Gamification glossary.

## Player positions
Most teams have their top performers, and your players probably know who they are. When you set up a game, we recommend you set it up in a way that prevents someone from drafting all of the top performers for their team.

Player Positions let you do exactly that. Group sets of players who have similar performance records, goals, and experience. For example, think about a baseball sports theme. You might place your top performer at the first base player position, and then group other top performers at second base, right field, catcher, and so on. When players draft their teams, each player can select one player at any given time from each available player position.

Tip
<pre><code>Start thinking about how you would group individuals on your team—by quota, how long they’ve been at the company, how successful they’ve been, their level of experience or skill, or any number of factors. The more you can level the playing field to make it as fair as possible, the more fun the game will be. If you're using fixed teams, you can also have players within other fixed teams compete against each other.</code></pre>

# Browser and system requirements for Gamification
[!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-md.md)] is a cloud-based service that requires no special software running on usersâ€™ computers other than an up-to-date web browser. The system and browser requirements for [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] are the same as those for [Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830208). In addition, your browser must be configured as follows:  
  
-   **Allow [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../gamification/includes/pn-javascript-md.md)] from [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)]**  
  
     [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../gamification/includes/pn-javascript-md.md)] must be enabled for your browser, at least for your [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] domain. Most browsers enable [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../gamification/includes/pn-javascript-md.md)] by default.  
  
-   **Allow cookies from [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)]**  
  
     Cookies must be enabled for your browser, at least for your [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] domain. Most browsers enable cookies by default.

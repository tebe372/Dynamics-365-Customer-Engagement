# Define weekly awards for Gamification players and fans
Configure weekly awards to keep players focused on delivering results for the right KPIs in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-md.md)]. Weekly awards are small contests that are part of a longer game, and are also posted on the leaderboard. You'll configure weekly awards for a single KPI in each game period.  
  
#### Configure a weekly award  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)], go to **Games** > **Games** > **Weekly Awards**![Weekly Awards button in Gamification](../gamification/media/weekly-awards-gamification.png "Weekly Awards button in Gamification").  
  
2.  Click the game period you want to configure weekly awards for.  
  
     If you run multiple games in parallel, select a game from the drop-down list in the page header.  
  
3.  Select the KPI you want to configure your weekly award for.  
  
4.  Configure the prize for first place.  
  
     Optionally, **Add**![Add button in Gamification](../gamification/media/add-button-gamification.png "Add button in Gamification") more places and configure prizes for them if you want.  
  
5.  Click **Save** to apply your configuration.  
  
 Weekly awards are now awarded automatically to the winning players. Make sure you follow up with them to give out the prizes. You can edit the weekly awards later on if you want to change the prizes or the associated KPIs.

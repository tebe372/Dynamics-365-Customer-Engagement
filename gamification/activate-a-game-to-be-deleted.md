# Activate a game - to be deleted
When you are ready to start a contest, you need to activate the game to send emails to all participating players and notify them when the contest starts. First, click the checkmark symbol and then click the **Activate Game** button.       If you use Fantasy Teams, the game start date must be at least 2 days from when you activate the game in order to allow the players at least one full day to draft their fantasy teams.  
  
 After you click the Activate Game button and prior to the Game Start Date, you can only change KPIs, Game Awards, and Player Game Quotas, but you can't add any new Percentage of Quota KPIs.  On or after the Game Start Date, you can still change the Game Awards and Player Game Quotas.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can add or remove Players or Fans at any time after you activate a Game using the **Players or Fans** symbol on the Games page which will appear after the Game is activated. If a Player is no longer with the company, you should deactivate them from the Players page.  When using [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_solution](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-solution-md.md)] it is important to deactivate players first in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-md.md)] before deactivating a player in CRM. If you are running a game using Fantasy Teams, you need to first deactivate in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](../gamification/includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] to freeze the points for the player so teams do not lose points for the current and past game periods.

# Collaborate in mixed reality with Field Service, Remote Assist, and HoloLens

Empower field technicians to solve problems faster by pairing the Field Service business application with the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mixed reality app. With heads-up, hands-free video calling on Microsoft HoloLens, technicians using Remote Assist are able to collaborate with remote experts on a computer or a mobile device to troubleshoot issues in context. 

The field technician can view field service bookings from Remote Assist and call the recommended expert. This capability enables heads-up, hands-free calling through HoloLens in the context.

To learn more about using the Field Service application with Remote Assist, see the [Remote Assist user guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/user-guide#use-dynamics-365-for-field-service-from-remote-assist).

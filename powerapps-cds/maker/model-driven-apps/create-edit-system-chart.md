# Quickstart: Create a system chart

In this quickstart you learn how to create a system chart. System charts are organization-owned charts, which makes them available to anyone with access to read the data running the app. System charts can’t be assigned or shared with specific app users.  
  
1. On the [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com) site, select **Model-driven** (lower left of the navigation pane).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> “If the **Model-driven** design mode isn't available, you may need to [Create an environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/administrator/create-environment).     
  
2. Expand **Data**, select **Entities**, select the entity that you want, and then select the **Charts** tab.  
  
3.  On the toolbar, select **Add chart**.  
  
4.  Specify the type of chart, and how the data is displayed in the chart.  
  
    -   Enter the chart name, such as *Number of employees by account*.  
  
    -   In the **Select Field** dropdowns: 
        - In the **Select Field** **Series** axis dropdown select a field such as **Number of Employees**.  
        - In the **Select Field** **Category** axis dropdown select a field such as **Account Name**.
  
    -   Add a description to identify the purpose of the chart, such as *This column chart displays the number of employees by account name*.

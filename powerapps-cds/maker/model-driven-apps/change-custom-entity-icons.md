# Change icons for custom entities

When you create a custom entity, it is automatically assigned a default icon. All custom entities use the same icon by default. Use custom icons to differentiate how your custom entities look. You canâ€™t modify the icons assigned to system entities.  
  
 You can upload three types of entity icons for each custom entity. 

> [!NOTE]
> The preferred type of file for all types is a scalable vector graphic (.svg) icon with transparency enabled. 
> 
> All icons must be no more than 10 kilobytes in size.

|Icon Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Unified Interface Icon**|Must be a scalable vector graphic (.svg) icon |
|**Icon in Web application**|If not a scalable vector graphic (.svg) icon, it can be a .gif, .png, or .jpg format image, 16x16 pixels in size.|
|**Icon for entity form**s|If not a scalable vector graphic (.svg) icon, it can be a .gif, .png, or .jpg format image, 32x32 pixels in size.|

Each type of icon is stored as a Web Resource. You can create the web resources first and then set the icons to use them, or you can create the new web resource within the **Lookup Record** dialog by selecting **New** while setting the value. More information: [Create or edit web resources to extend an app](create-edit-web-resources.md)

1. In the  view selector, choose **Unmanaged Solutions**.
1. Open the existing unmanaged solution that contains the entity you want to edit.
1. Select the entity to edit it.

### Set entity icons

1. On the command bar, select **Update Icons**.  
  
1. In the **Select New Icons** dialog box, in the **Web Client** tab, under **Icon in Web application** or **Icon for Entity Forms**, to the right of **New Icon**, select the **Browse** button ![Lookup button](media/lookup-button-4.gif).
2. Select or create the appropriate web resource, and then select **OK**. 
3. In the **Unified Interface** tab, do the same for the **New Icon** field.
4. Select **OK** to close the **Select New Icons** dialog
5. On the command bar, on the **File** menu, select **Save**.

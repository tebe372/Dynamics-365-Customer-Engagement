# Create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) entity relationships in PowerApps portal

The [PowerApps portal](https://web.powerapps.com) provides an easy way to create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) relationships for  Common Data Service for Apps.

The portal enables configuring the most common options, but certain options can only be set using solution explorer. More information: 
- [Create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) relationships](create-edit-1n-relationships.md)
- [Create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) entity relationships in PowerApps solution explorer](create-edit-1n-relationships-solution-explorer.md).

## View entity relationships

1. From the [PowerApps portal](https://web.powerapps.com), select either **Model-driven** or **Canvas** design mode.
2. Select **Data** > **Entities** and select the entity that has the relationships you want to view.
3. With the **Relationships** tab selected, you can select the following views: 

 |View|Description|
 |--|--|
 |**All**| Shows all the relationships for the entity|
 |**Custom**|Shows only custom relationships for the entity|
 |**Default**|Shows only the standard relationships for the entity|
<!-- TODO: What is the actual difference between All and Default? -->

> [!NOTE]
> For information about **Many-to-many** relationships see [Create N:N (many-to-many) relationships](create-edit-nn-relationships.md)

Depending on your choice you will see either:

|Type|Panel|
|--|--|
|**Many-to-one**|![Many to one relationship panel](media/many-to-one-relationship-panel.png)|
|**One-to-many**|![One to many relationship panel](media/one-to-many-relationship-panel.png)|

Choose either the **Related entity** or the **Primary entity** for the relationship you want to create between the two entities. 

> [!NOTE]
> With either choice, a lookup field will be created on the related entity.

Once you select the entity you can edit the details of the relationship. In this example, multiple contact entity records can be associated with a single account.

You can edit the default values provided before you save. Select **More options** to view the **Relationship name** and **Lookup field description** values

|Field|Description|
|--|--|
|**Lookup field display name**|The localizable text for the lookup field that will be created on the related entity.<br />This can be edited later.|
|**Lookup field name**|The name for the Lookup field that will be created on the related entity.|
|**Relationship name**|The name for the relationship that will be created.|
|**Lookup field description**|The description for the lookup field. In model-driven apps this will appear as a tooltip when people hover their mouse over the field. <br />This can be edited later.|

You can continue editing the entity. Select **Save Entity** to create the relationship you have configured.

## Edit relationships

While [viewing entity relationships](#view-entity-relationships), select the relationship you want to edit.

> [!NOTE]
> Each relationship can be found within the primary entity or the related entity as a **Many-to-one** or **One-to-many** relationship. Although it can be edited in either place, it is the same relationship.
>
> The publisher of a managed solution can prevent some customizations of relationships that are part of their solution.

The only fields you can edit are **Lookup field display name** and **Lookup field description**. These can also be edited in the properties of the lookup field in the related entity. More information: [Edit a field](create-edit-field-portal.md#edit-a-field)

## Delete relationships

While [viewing entity relationships](#view-entity-relationships), select the relationship you want to delete.

![Delete entity relationship](media/delete-entity-relationship-portal.png)

You can use the **Delete relationship** command from the command bar or from the row context menu when you click the elipses (**...**).

Deleteing the relationship will delete the lookup field on the related entity.

> [!NOTE]
> You will not be able to delete a relationship that has dependencies. For example, if you have added the lookup field to a form for the related entity, you must remove the field from the form before you delete the relationship.

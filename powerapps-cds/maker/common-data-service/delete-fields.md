# Delete fields

With the system administrator security role, you can delete any custom fields that arenâ€™t part of a managed solution. When you delete a field, any data stored in the field is lost. The only way to recover data from a field that was deleted is to restore the database from a point before the field was deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can delete a custom field, you must remove any dependencies that may exist in other solution components. 

## Using PowerApps portal

See [Create and edit fields using PowerApps portal](create-edit-field-portal.md) for information about working with entity fields.

If you select a custom field that can be deleted in the list, the **Delete field** command appears and is enabled.

Use the **Delete field** command to delete the field. After deleting the field you must save the changes to the entity.

> [!NOTE]
> If you get an error related to dependencies, you must use solution explorer to detect dependencies. More information: [Check field dependencies](#check-field-dependencies)

## Using PowerApps solution explorer

See [Create and edit fields using PowerApps solution explorer](create-edit-field-solution-explorer.md) for information about working with entity fields. 

1. Select a custom field that can be deleted in the list and click the ![Delete command](../model-driven-apps/media/delete.gif) button in the command bar.
2. In the **Confirm Deletion** dialog, select **Delete**.

> [!TIP]
> You can select multiple custom fields to be deleted in one operation.

### Check field dependencies 

Select the field in the list. In the **More Actions** menu, select **Show Dependencies**.

Dependencies are any related use of the field that would prevent it from being deleted. For example, if the field is used in a form or view, you must first remove references to the field in those solution components.  
  
If you delete a lookup field, the 1:N entity relationship for it will automatically be deleted.

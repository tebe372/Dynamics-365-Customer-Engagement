# Use XRM tooling with classes generated using the code-generation tool

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector> assembly doesn’t directly provide interfaces for the entity and data context classes generated using the code-generation tool. However, you can use the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement connection created by the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient> class to set up your entity and data context classes by using the code-generation tool. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create Early Bound Entity Classes with the Code Generation Tool (CrmSvcUtil.exe)](../org-service/create-early-bound-entity-classes-code-generation-tool.md)
  
 To use the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] connection created by the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient> class, create a connection to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] by using an instance of this class, and then set the value of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Client.OrganizationServiceProxy> object to the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient.OrganizationServiceProxy> property.  
  
```csharp  
CrmServiceClient crmSvc = new CrmServiceClient(new System.Net.NetworkCredential("<UserName>", "<Password>",“<Domain>”),"<Server>", "<Port>", "<OrgName>");  
  
// Verify that you are connected.  
if (crmSvc != null && crmSvc.IsReady)  
{  
    //Display the CRM version number and org name that you are connected to  
    Console.WriteLine("Connected to CRM! (Version: {0}; Org: {1}",   
    crmSvc.ConnectedOrgVersion, crmSvc.ConnectedOrgUniqueName);  
  
    Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Client.OrganizationServiceProxy prox = crmSvc.OrganizationServiceProxy;   
}  
else  
{  
    // Display the last error.  
    Console.WriteLine("Error occurred: {0}", crmSvc.LastCrmError);  
  
    // Display the last exception message if any.  
    Console.WriteLine(crmSvc.LastCrmException.Message);  
    Console.WriteLine(crmSvc.LastCrmException.Source);  
    Console.WriteLine(crmSvc.LastCrmException.StackTrace);  
  
    return;  
}  
  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Client.OrganizationServiceProxy> class isn’t thread safe. While working with the entity and data context classes generated by using the code-generation tool or using [!INCLUDE[pn_LINQ](../../includes/pn-linq.md)] to retrieve data, you might consider creating a locking scheme in your code if it runs in a multithreaded environment.

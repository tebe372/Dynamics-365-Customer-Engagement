# Meet the Sales app for small to medium-sized business

So, now you’re a user of the [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales.md)] app designed especially for businesses like yours. 

The app comes with a wizard that simplifies the setup process, including connecting email, sharing documents,
and importing data.

Plus, sellers will find a streamlined lead to cash process, easier account, contact, and opportunity management, and dashboards that make it faster to visualize useful information at a glance.

# Get productive quickly

The app is designed to make getting up to speed simple and painless, whether you’re handling your day-to-day sales transactions or setting up the app for your team.  

What’s the fastest way to get productive? 

Here are a couple options:

-   **Dive in and try out the sample data.** If you learn best through your own hands-on exploration, the app comes with sample
data to help you see how data is presented and organized, and to give you something to experiment with as you get oriented. 

  Start clicking, take the guided tours, and play around with the sample data until you’re ready to work with your real customer data.

-   **Do a quick read that covers the basics.** The user guide contains all the essentials you need to know to navigate the app, find and enter customer data, glean actionable insights from interactive dashboards, and more. And it’s short. (We know you’re busy.)


No matter how you decide to get started, soon you’ll be up and running – working your deals and building profitable relationships along the way, as you turn your customers into lifelong fans of your products.

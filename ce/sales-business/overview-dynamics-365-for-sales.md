# Overview of Dynamics 365 for Sales, Preview

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]


> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Learn about the usage and extensibility restrictions for Dynamics 365 for Sales, Preview](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850959).

Welcome to [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview. If you don't need a full-fledged enterprise app for your organization, the new [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview app is for you. 

This offering, available online-only and built on the new Unified Interface framework, contains a targeted set of sales capabilities to get your organization up and running quickly.

It is designed from the ground up with accessibility in mind, and uses responsive web design principles to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience for any screen size, device, or orientation. For example, subgrids morph into lists for smaller screen sizes.

[!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview comes with a wizard that simplifies the setup process, including connecting email, sharing documents,
and importing data.

Plus, sellers will find a streamlined lead to cash process, easier account, contact, and opportunity management, and dashboards that make it faster to visualize useful information at a glance.

## Get productive quickly

The app is designed to make getting up to speed simple and painless, whether you’re handling your day-to-day sales transactions or setting up the app for your team.  

What’s the fastest way to get productive? 

Here are a couple options:

-  **Dive in and try out the sample data.** If you learn best through your own hands-on exploration, the app comes with sample
data to help you see how data is presented and organized, and to give you something to experiment with as you get oriented. 

 Start clicking, take the guided tours, and play around with the sample data until you’re ready to work with your real customer data.

-  **Do a quick read that covers the basics.** The user guide contains all the essentials you need to know to navigate the app, find and enter customer data, glean actionable insights from interactive dashboards, and more. And it’s short. (We know you’re busy.)

No matter how you decide to get started, soon you’ll be up and running – working your deals and building profitable relationships along the way, as you turn your customers into lifelong fans of your products.

Ready to get started? 
First, we’ll cover basic navigation.

##  Find your way around the app

The Sales app is designed so that you can access the tools and customer data you need quickly when you need them.

###  Nav bar at the top

The nav bar at the top of every screen includes buttons for common tasks like searching for customer data or entering records. The nav bar also includes access to tools that help you manage your deals, such as a guided task flow that walks you through common sales tasks, or the Relationship Assistant that offers suggestions for the next steps to take with your customers.
Here’s a quick run-down of what you’ll find on the nav bar.

###  Menu on the side

Select the Site map icon to see a list of all your options in one place, including access to communication tools like email and Skype calling, customer records, your calendar, and settings. 
You’ll also find quick access to any favorite customers you’ve pinned and your recent work, so you don’t have to waste time backtracking.

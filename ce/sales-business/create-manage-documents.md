# Manage your [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] documents and document locations in [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview, you can store your documents on [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], and manage them from within your app.

The documents that you create in the Sales app are stored on [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], and are automatically synced to your desktop and mobile devices.

> [!Note]
> Before you can use [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] to store the documents, it must be enabled by your system administrator.

> [!Important]
> This feature requires that you have an [!INCLUDE[pn-office-365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription or a subscription to an online service such as [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].

## What happens when you navigate to the Documents tab first time?

When [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] is enabled, for record types that support document management, a default document location (folder) is automatically created on [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] the first time you go to the **Documents** tab. The name of the document location is in the following format: &lt;record\_name&gt;\_&lt;record\_id&gt;.

## View existing [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] documents

Open a view with a document grid.

For example,

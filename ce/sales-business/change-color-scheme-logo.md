# Change the color scheme or logo for your organization

[!INCLUDE[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Change the color scheme of the user interface based on your preference or create your own branding by changing the color scheme or logo in the [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales.md)] app. You can create a custom look and feel (a theme), for your [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales.md)] app and the [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for phones app by creating new themes with colors and visual elements.

The theme colors are applied globally throughout the application. For example, you can enhance the following visual elements in the UI:

-   Change product logos

-   Change Nav Bar Color, Main Color, Accent Color

-   Nav Bar color defines the background color for the navigation bar

-   Main Color defines the color for command bar, buttons, and tabs

-   Accent Color defines the color for process bar

## Apply a new theme

[!INCLUDE[pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales.md)] come with three default themes that you can use. You can choose one of these default themes and apply, or pick any other custom theme that you may have created.

To apply a theme, select the theme in the **Select Theme** drop-down list, and click **Save and** **Apply Theme**.

The theme that you are currently using is shown with the text “currently applied”.

## Create a new theme

1.  Go to **Advanced** **Settings** &gt; **Branding** & **Theme**.

2.  Click **Create new theme**.

3.  In the **Theme Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the new theme.

4.  To change the logo, click **Edit** on the logo box, and then choose an image file of type JPG, PNG, GIF or SVG format.
    The image file is converted to a web resource.

    To revert to the default [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales.md)] logo, click **Restore default logo**.

5.  Enter a tooltip for the logo.

6.  Choose the colors in the **Nav Bar Color**, **Main Color**, and **Accent Color boxes**.

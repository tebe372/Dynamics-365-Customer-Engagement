# Enable automatic generation of quotes and invoices

Make sure that all the quotes or invoices that your sales team is sending out to the customers follow a consistent format and branding by enabling automatic generation of quotes and invoices.

1.  Make sure you have the Sales Manager – Business or a System Administrator role to be able to enable auto-generation of quotes or invoices documents.

2.  Go to **Settings** &gt; **Quote to Invoice**.

3.  To enable automatic generation of quote documents, select the **Auto-generate quote as a Word document** check box, and then select the quote Word template from the drop-down list.

4.  To enable automatic generation of invoice documents, select the **Auto-generate invoice as a Word document** check box, and then select the invoice Word template from the drop-down list. All the out-of-the-box templates and the custom templates that you’ve created will be available in the drop-down list.

5.  Click **Save**.

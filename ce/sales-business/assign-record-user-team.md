# Assign a record to a user or team

If you would like another person in your organization to handle an account or contact for you, you can assign the record to that person.

You can also assign a record to a team, or to yourself.

1.  Click the Menu icon, and then click **Accounts** or **Contacts**.

2.  In the list of records, select the record that you want.

3.  On the command bar, click **Assign**.

4.  In the **Assign** dialog box, click the **Assign to** box to toggle between **Me** and User or Team.

5.  If you have chosen to assign to **User or Team**, then in the **User or team** field, click the **Lookup** icon to select a user or a team.

6.  Click **Assign**.

# Add or remove sample data in [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Sample data gives you something to experiment with as you learn [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales.md)], and helps you see how data is organized in the system. At some point, you’ll probably want to remove the sample data.

Or, if sample data isn’t installed on your system, you may want to add it for training purposes. Later, when you’re ready, you can remove it.

> [!Important]

> Use sample data to learn and play around with system features. However, to avoid unwanted results, don’t associate it with any data you actually need.

1.  Make sure you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role in [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-sales.md)].

2.  Click the Menu icon ![Menu icon](media/open-menu-icon.png "Open the Menu icon"), and then click **Settings**.

3.  On the **Advanced Settings** page, under **Others**, click **Sample Data Management**.

4.  Click **Sample Data**. You’ll see a message that tells you whether the sample data is currently installed.

5.  If sample data isn’t already added, click **Add Sample Data**.

  -OR-

  If sample data is added, click **Remove Sample Data**.

# Manage tasks, appointments, email, or phone calls in Dynamics 365 for Sales, Preview

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Keep track of all your customer communications with activities in [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview. For example, you can send email, make phone calls, set up appointments, and assign yourself tasks as you work a sale. These actions are all considered types of activities.

The system automatically timestamps every activity and shows who created it. You and other people on your team can scroll through the activities to see the history as you work with a customer.

To get the most out of your Sales app, it’s important for everyone in the organization to track all their customer interactions by adding an activity for every email, phone call, task, or appointment. That way, a customer’s history is complete.

## Find your activities

Select the Site Map icon ![Icon to open the menu](media/Site-map-icon.png "Icon to open the site map"), and then select one of the following:  

-   Task

-   Appointment

-   Email

-   Phone Call

## Filter the list of activities  

You can filter the list of activities to see only the ones you’re interested in. For example, filter the list to see closed tasks, or to see emails that you sent.

1.  Go to the activity list. For example, to see the emails that you sent, select the Site Map icon ![Site Map icon](media/Site-map-icon.png "Icon to open the menu"), and then select **Email Messages**.  

2.  Select the down arrow next to the view name at the top of the page, and select the **My Sent** **Emails** view.

## Add a new activity for a customer  

Most often, you’ll want to add an activity associated with a contact, opportunity, account, or other type of record to help you keep track of all the communication history you have with a customer. (You can also add an activity for yourself.)

As your organization’s relationship with a customer develops over time, you and other people on your team can look through the activity feed as you work with the customer, and see the history of your interactions.

1.  Open the record you want to add the activity to.

2.  In the Timeline section, select **+** and select the type of activity you want to add.

## Add an activity for yourself  

Add a task or note for yourself when you want a reminder to do something personal, like schedule a doctor’s appointment or attend a sporting event.

Otherwise, to keep a history of your interactions with a customer, you should add new activities that are associated with a customer’s record, so those activities become part of the history that other people on your team can view.

1.  Select the Site Map icon ![Site map icon](media/Site-map-icon.png "Icon to open the site map"), and then select **&lt;Activity Type&gt;**. For example, select **Tasks**.  

    ![Menu showing the activity type "Task"](media/activity-type-in-menu.png "Menu showing the activity type "Task"")  

2.  On the nav bar, select **&lt;Activity Type&gt;**. For example, **Tasks**.

    ![Command bar button for creating a new activity type "Task"](media/activity-type-command-bar-button.png "Command bar button for creating a new activity type "Task"")  


3.  Fill in the fields, and then select **Save**.

## Mark an activity complete  

After you call someone, complete a task, send an email, or go to an appointment, you can mark the activity for that action as completed.

1.   Open the activity.

2.   On the command bar, select **Mark Complete**.

# Define fiscal year settings in [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview

[!INCLUDE[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)], Preview, a fiscal period defines the time reflected in financial reports. It is used for reporting of financial data in a given period. For example, you want to know what’s the actual revenue of your organization in your fiscal period which is from January - December. You can set the fiscal year period, and how it’s displayed, for your organization.

1.  Make sure you have the System Administrator security role in [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-business-doc-name](../includes/pn-sales-business-doc-name.md)].
  
2.  Go to **Settings** &gt; **Fiscal Year**.

3.  Type information in the text boxes.

    -   In the **Start Date** box, select the date to start the fiscal year.

    -   In the **Fiscal Period Template** drop-down list, select how your fiscal year is divided.

    -   In the **Fiscal Year** drop-down list, select how you want to display the fiscal year.

    -   In the **Fiscal Period** drop-down list, select how you want to display the fiscal period.

    -   In **Name Based On** drop-down list, select whether the fiscal year name is displayed on the start or end of the fiscal year.

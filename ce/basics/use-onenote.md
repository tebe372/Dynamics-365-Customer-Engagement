# Use OneNote in Dynamics 365 (online)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

If your administrator has set up [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], you can  access a [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] notebook directly from the activities area in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. This doesn’t replace the current Notes feature, but gives you another way to access notes stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)]. When you add a [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] section to a notebook, it’s shown individually within [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] and in order of last modified time.  
  
 [Watch a short video (2:01) about OneNote integration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837793).  
  
 For information on setting up [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] integration if you're a system administrator, see [Set up OneNote integration in Dynamics 365](../admin/set-up-onenote-integration-in-dynamics-365.md).

>  If you aren’t signed in to [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)], you’ll go to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] sign-in page when you select the title of the [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] notebook. When you sign in, you’ll go directly to the notebook.  
  
### Get started with OneNote  (mobile-optimized app)

1.  Open the record you want to open or edit the OneNote for.  

2.  In the **Timeline** section, select the **Add info and activities** icon ![Add info and activities icon](../../../icon.png "Icon for Add info and activities"), and then select **OneNote**.
  
 ![Choose OneNote in the Timeline section](media/onenote-option-in-timeline.png "Choose OneNote in the Timeline section")  
  
	If a notebook is already associated with the record, the notebook opens. Else, a new notebook is created and opened.   
  
 ![Notebook linked to the record is opened](media/open-onenote.png "Notebook linked to the record is opened") 
  
3.  The notebook is stored in the associated [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] folder for the record. If there is more than one associated folder, the notebook is created in the first folder.

### Get started with OneNote (web app)  
  
1.  In the activities area of a record, select **OneNote**.  
  
 ![Choose OneNote on the activity wall](../basics/media/use-onenote.PNG "Choose OneNote on the activity wall")  
  
2.  Select a notebook to make entries.  
  
 ![Select a notebook](../basics/media/select-notebook.PNG "Select a notebook")  
 
3.  The notebook is stored in the associated [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] folder for the record. If there is more than one associated folder, the notebook is created in the first folder.  
  
 ![Notebooks in associated SharePoint folder](../basics/media/use-onenote.PNG "Notebooks in associated SharePoint folder")  
  
> [!NOTE]
> -   You can’t edit the [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] file from within Dynamics 365. This can be done only from the [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] app that opens when you choose the [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] link. . In web app, OneNote is opened in [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] app of [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-office-365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] in a separate tab.  
> -   Don’t delete any [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)]. onetoc2 or .one file types in the **OneNote** section in Dynamics 365. If you do, you won’t be able to access your Dynamics 365 OneNote notebook.  
> -   Sections groups that keep related sections together in [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] aren’t supported in Dynamics 365.  
> -   You can only rename a section in the desktop version of [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)]. If you rename a section in [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)] online, you won’t see the updated section name in Dynamics 365.

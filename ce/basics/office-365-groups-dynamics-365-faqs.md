# Office 365 Groups in Dynamics 365 FAQs

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

The following are frequently asked questions and known issues for [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)].  
  
## Where is the Office 365 Groups data stored?  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)] data is stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)], not [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)].  
  
## Why can’t I create Office 365 Groups using bulk import?  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)] will only be automatically created if your system administrator has turned on auto-create for the record type that you’re attempting to bulk import. In addition, to ensure performance and stability for others, [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] won’t create groups if you try to import a large number of records at once. We recommend a maximum of 20 records at a time if you need groups to be auto-created. If you import more than this, we can’t guarantee that a group is created. If a group wasn’t created due to a large bulk-import, you can manually create a group by navigating to that record’s groups page.  
  
## Why don’t I see all of my group's meetings in Dynamics 365?  
 At this time we’re unable to show meetings that someone from outside of your company has set up and has invited your group to attend. We are working on a solution to this issue, but in the meantime you can use the **Open Calendar** link to check your group's calendar in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_outlook_web_app](../includes/pn-microsoft-outlook-web-app.md)] (Outlook Online).  
  
## Why do I get a RetrieveOfficeSettings: 1 error when I navigate to the Office 365 Groups page?  
 This is a known issue. Refresh the page and the error message will go away.  
  
## Why do I get a (500) Internal Server Error when I navigate to the Office 365 Groups page?  
 This is a generic error which could have multiple causes. One common case is that the user who is attempting to view the group doesn’t have a valid [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] license.  
  
## When should we use Office 365 Groups versus Yammer?  
 Groups are a great way to collaborate across your organization. They’re also integrated with [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] products, providing you quick and easy access to all of your conversations, meetings, documents, and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_onenote](../includes/pn-microsoft-onenote.md)].  
  
 We recommend using groups for collaborations that require lots of document sharing and quick access to other [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] products.

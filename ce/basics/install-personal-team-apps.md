## Install the personal and team apps

You have a choice when adding Dynamics 365 to Microsoft Teams. You can install the personal app which integrates Dynamics 365 and Teams for your own use, and you can install the team app to use with your team members. We'll take the simplest approach and install both.

Once you've selected the Dynamics 365 app (see steps above), the settings page opens. 

1. For **Add to a team**, choose a team to pin content and services to, and the select **Install**. This installs the personal and team app.

   > ![](media/teams-install-app.png "Install the Dynamics 365 app")

2. In the next page, choose the channel where you want to use the Dynamics 365 app. Then, select **Set up**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/teams-install-app-step2.png "Install the Dynamics 365 app, step 2")

3. Recently viewed records appear, if there are any. Search for and select an entity to pin. Use **Filter by** to narrow the search to an entity type. 

   Enable **Post to the channel about this tab** to [need content].

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/teams-install-app-step2.png "Install the Dynamics 365 app, step 2")

   If you have multiple organizations or app modules, select **Edit** (![Edit](media/edit-icon.png "Edit")) to specify which records to pin to the discussion channel.
 
   ![Specify org and app](media/teams-change-org-app.png "Specify org and app")

   Enable **Remember this preference** to set the org and app selections to be the default personal dashboard that appears when you select **My Dashboard**.

   Use the **Settings** tab to change these settings any time.

 4. Select **Save**. 

Once you complete the above steps, the Dynamics 365 tab appears in the menu bar.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/teams-pinned-record2.png "Dynamics 365 record tab")

You can interact with the record as if you were using the Dynamics 365 web app. Those with Write permissions can edit the record; changes will be synchronized with the Dynamics 365 web app.

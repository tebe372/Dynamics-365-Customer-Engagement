# Use bot to search records

There are two personal app features: the personal bot and the personal dashboard. The bot allows you to interact with Dynamics 365 to find and display records within Microsoft Teams. 

Once you've completed installing the Dynamics 365 Teams app, you're taken to the **Conversation** tab with the bot ready for use. If at any time in Teams you want to return to the personal app, select ... from the left-side menu, and then select **Dynamics 365 (Preview)**.

A Welcome message appears in the **Conversation** tab page. Select **Sign in**.

You can search to find records of interest. For example, search for Contoso records.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/teams-first-bot2.png "Search for Contoso records")

Search returns a list of related Dynamics 365 records. Select a record to see details.

The details of the selected record are displayed in the personal app bot. You can select an activity to view and edit related record details. For example, select **Show Opportunities** to see opportunities for the Contoso account.

You can update the details of the records in the personal app.

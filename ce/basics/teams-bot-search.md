Once you've completed installing the Dynamics 365 Teams app, you're taken to the **Conversation** tab with the bot ready for use. If at any time in Teams you want to return to the personal app, select ... from the left-side menu, and then select **Dynamics 365 (Preview)**.

A Welcome message appears in the **Conversation** tab page. Select **Sign in**.

You can search to find records of interest. For example, search for Contoso records.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/teams-first-bot2.png "Search for Contoso records")

Search returns a list of related Dynamics 365 records. Select a record to see details.

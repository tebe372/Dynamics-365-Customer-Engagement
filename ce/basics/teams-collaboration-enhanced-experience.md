Easily pin a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record or view to a Teams channel using the **Collaborate** option in the Dynamics 365 app. The step-by-step process will help you connect the selected record or view a Teams channel.

## Pin a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record or view to a Teams channel

1. In Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement app, open a record or view.
2. When the record or view is open, on the command bar, select **Collaborate**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Collaborate option](media/teams-collorate-option_1.png "Collaborate option in Dynamics 365 app")

3. On the **Collaborate with Microsoft Teams** window, select **Get started**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Get started button](media/teams-get-started-2.png "Selected Get Started")
   
   > [!NOTE]
   >  - If there is channel that is already set-up, then can use the existing pinned channel by selecting channel and then select **Start collaboration**. Or, you can create a new channel, by selecting **Create a new connection**.
    
      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
      > ![Select existing channel](media/teams-existing-channel-screen-note.png "Selected existing channel")
   
   
4. To pin the record to an exising team or a new team, do one of the following:

  - **To pin to an existing team**
    1. From the list of teams that you belong to, choose the team that you want to pin the record to and select **Next**.
   
       > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
       > ![Choose a team](media/teams-add-to-existing-team-3.png "Choose a team")
    
    2. Choose an existing channel and then select **Next** or select **Create new channel** to create a new channel.
    
       > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
       > ![Choose a channel](media/teams-choose-channel.png "Choose a channel")
   
  - **Or, to pin to a new team**
    1. To create a new team select, **Create new team**. 
 
       > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
       > ![Choose a team](media/teams-create-new-team-4.png "Choose a team")

    2. Enter a name for the team and then select **Next**.
    
       > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
       > ![Enter name](media/teams-enter-team-name-5.png "Enter a team name")
      
    3. When you create a new team, the system automatically creates a channel named **General**. You can add the record to the **General** channel and then select **Next** or select **create new channel** to create a new channel. 
    
       > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
       > ![Enter name](media/teams-add-channel-6.png "Enter a team name")
       
 > [!NOTE]
 >  You will only see the next step if you are the owner of the Teams channel.
 
 5. If you are the owner of the Teams channel then you can add teammates to the channel. From the list, select the recommended members who either own the record or the record has been shared with them. You can also use the search option to find other teammates related to the record. When you are done, select **Finish**.
 
 > [!NOTE]
 > For more information on how to share a record, see [Assign or share records.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/user/assign-or-share-records)

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Choose teammates](media/teams-choose-teammates-7.png "Choose teammates")
   
When the set-up process is complete, the system will open the Teams channel that you created.

## Troubleshoot configuration issues with Teams Integration

Teams integration uses SharePoint integration at the backend, so if there is a failure with SharePoint integration or OneDrive configuration, it will also fail when you enable Teams integration.

If you get an error while configuring Microsoft Teams Integration from Dynamics 365, it might be because of the following pre-requisites is not met.

- SharePoint Integration is not configured, and OneDrive Integration is enabled. To Fix the issue, disable OneDrive.

- SharePoint Integration is not configured but there is an active SharePoint Site in your organization. To fix the issue, deactivate the SharePoint site.

- SharePoint Integration is not configured but there is SharePoint document locations created with an absolute URL in your organization. To fix the issue, delete locations with an absolute URL.

# Collaborate with Teams 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]


Once installed, the Dynamics 365 app for Teams enables collaborating with others through Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record connections made in teams and channels in Microsoft Teams.

## Connect a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record to a team channel

From a team channel, you can connect a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record to collaborate on a customer account, an opportunity, and so on as follows.

1. Open a team channel and select the **Add** button (![Add button](media/plus-2.png "Add button")).

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select Add button](media/teams-add-tab.png "Select Add button")

2. Select the **Dynamics 365** icon to pin a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record to a channel.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Add Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement appsTeam channel](media/teams-add-channel.png "Add Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement appsTeam channel")

3. Select **Entity Selection** or **View Selection**.

    3.1 **Entity Selection**: Search for an entity to connect. You can pick a recently viewed record or use search to find records. You     can use **Filter by** to narrow the search to an entity type. Once you've picked a record, select **Save**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Search for entity](media/teams-add-channel-pin-record2.png "Search for entity")

   In the above page, if you have multiple environments or app modules, you can change the environment and app module by selecting      **Edit** (![Edit](media/edit-icon.png "Edit")) to specify which environment or app module to use in Teams.
 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Specify org and app](media/teams-change-org-app.png "Specify org and app")

   You can enable **Remember this preference** to set the environment and app selections to be the default personal dashboard that appears when you select **My Dashboard**.

   You can return to these settings any time by selecting the **Settings** tab.

    Once you complete the above steps, you'll see a notification of a successful connection and the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement   apps record appears in the menu bar. You can interact with the record as if you were using the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement     apps. Those with Write permissions can edit the record. Changes will be synchronized with the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement  apps.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Record successfully connected and pinned](media/teams-pinned-record.png "Record successfully connected and pinned")

   3.2 **View Selection**: Select an entity to see the list of available views. When you select a view, it will be pinned as a tab.
  
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select a view](media/teams-select-view.png "Select an view")
   
     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
     > ![Select a view](media/teams-select-view2.png "Select an view")
   
    If you select a personal view (**My Views**) instead of **System Views**, itâ€™s recommended that you share the view with other users     in Teams before you add the view to the Teams channel. Otherwise, other team members will not hae access to the view content.
   
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select from My View](media/teams-select-view3.png "Select from My View")
   
    Once you complete the above steps, you'll see the the record view in Teams.

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
     > ![My View in Teams](media/teams-select-view4.png "My View in Teams")

The following section provides information about connections between Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps and Microsoft Teams.

### Two connection states (only applies to step 3.1 **Entity Selection**)

There are two connection states possible when connecting Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps and Microsoft Teams: successful and failed. 

The successful connection state indicates that the connection was successfully saved in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps so that the link to the connected Microsoft Teams channel appears on the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps page and the files used on this channel also appear on the **Documents** tab in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps. 

A failed connection means the connection was not successfully saved. When seeing this message, you should remove and connect the record again. See: [Error: This record is not connected to Dynamics 365. Repin the tab and try again.](teams-troubleshoot.md#error-this-record-is-not-connected-to-dynamics-365-repin-the-tab-and-try-again)

### View and associate files (only applies to step 3.1 **Entity Selection**)

Select the **Files** tab in the connected Teams channel to associate files with a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record. Files added here will appear in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps under **Documents** for the linked record. Likewise, when you add a document to a record in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps, that document will appear in Teams under the **Files** tab.

> ![Shared files in multiple locations](media/teams-error-multiple-locations.png "Shared files in multiple locations")

When there is more than one Microsoft Teams channel connected to a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record, each of the channels appears as a separate document location in Dynamics. You can switch to a different location by selecting **Document Location** to specify the location of the file.

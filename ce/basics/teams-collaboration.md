# Collaborate with Teams - Basic Experience

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]


Once installed, the Dynamics 365 app for Teams enables collaborating with others through Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record connections made in teams and channels in Microsoft Teams.

## Connect a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record or view to a team channel

From a team channel, you can connect a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record or view to collaborate on customer accounts,  opportunities, and so on as follows. 

1. Open a team channel and select the **Add** button (![Add button](media/plus-2.png "Add button")).

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select Add button](media/teams-add-tab.png "Select Add button")

2. Select the **Dynamics 365** icon to pin a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record to a channel.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Add Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement appsTeam channel](media/teams-add-channel.png "Add Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement appsTeam channel")

3. Select **Entity Selection** or **View Selection**.

- **Entity Selection**
    1. Search for an entity to connect. You can pick a recently viewed record or use search to find records. You can use **Filter by** to narrow the search to an entity type.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Search for entity](media/teams-add-channel-pin-record2.png "Search for entity")

    2. If you are the owner of the team, you will see an option to add other members to the taeam who either own the reocrd or it has been shared with them. When you are done select **Save**. 
     
    Once you complete the above steps, you'll see a notification of a successful connection and the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement   apps record appears in the menu bar. You can interact with the record as if you were using the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement     apps. Those with Write permissions can edit the record. Changes will be synchronized with the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement  apps.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Record successfully connected and pinned](media/teams-pinned-record.png "Record successfully connected and pinned")
   
    
    **Two connection states** 

    There are two connection states possible when connecting Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps and Microsoft Teams: successful and failed. 

    The successful connection state indicates that the connection was successfully saved in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps so that the link to the connected Microsoft Teams channel appears on the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps page and the files used on this channel also appear on the **Documents** tab in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps. 

    A failed connection means the connection was not successfully saved. When seeing this message, you should remove and connect the record again. See: [Error: This record is not connected to Dynamics 365. Repin the tab and try again.](teams-troubleshoot.md#error-this-record-is-not-connected-to-dynamics-365-repin-the-tab-and-try-again)

    **View and associate files** 

    Select the **Files** tab in the connected Teams channel to associate files with a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record. Files added here will appear in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps under **Documents** for the linked record. Likewise, when you add a document to a record in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps, that document will appear in Teams under the **Files** tab.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Files tab in Teams app](media/teams-files-tab.png "Files tab in Teams app")

- **View Selection**
    1. Select an entity to see the list of available views in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement app. Once you've picked a view, select **Save**.
  
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select a view](media/teams-select-view.png "Select an view")
   
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select a view](media/teams-select-view2.png "Select an view")
   
   Once you complete the above steps, you'll see the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement app entity view in the new added tab.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![My View in Teams](media/teams-select-view4.png "My View in Teams")
     
     
   > [!NOTE]
   > - If you select a personal view (**My Views**) instead of **System Views**, itâ€™s recommended that you share the view with other users in Teams before you add the view to the Teams channel. Otherwise, other team members will not hae access to the view content.
   
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select from My View](media/teams-select-view3.png "Select from My View")

4. If you have multiple environments or app modules, you can change the environment and app module by selecting **Edit** (![Edit](media/edit-icon.png "Edit")) to specify which environment or app module to use in Teams.
 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Specify org and app](media/teams-change-org-app.png "Specify org and app")

   You can enable **Remember this preference** to set the environment and app selections to be the default personal dashboard that appears when you select **My Dashboard**.

   You can return to these settings any time by selecting the **Settings** tab.

In addition, document management actions in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps are integrated with Teams. You can see the channel file library in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps and directly upload files; uploaded files will appear in the Teams channel file library under the **Files** tab. Files uploaded in the Teams app will appear in the **Documents** tab in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps document management in Teams](media/teams-documents-d365.png "Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps document management in Teams")

## If you see this message: Shared files exist in multiple locations. Select "Document Location" to see files in other locations.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Shared files in multiple locations](media/teams-error-multiple-locations.png "Shared files in multiple locations")

When there is more than one Microsoft Teams channel connected to a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps record, each of the channels appears as a separate document location in Dynamics. You can switch to a different location by selecting **Document Location** to specify the location of the file.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Change document location](media/teams-change-document-location.png "Change document location")


To view a consolidated file list across all document locations including all connected team channel file libraries, from **Document Location** select **All Locations**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Document location](media/doclocation.png "Document location")


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Document location](media/doclocation1.png "Document location")

## Record types supporting Collaborate    

Currently, the following record types only support Microsoft Teams collaborate capabilities in Dynamisc 365 Customer Engagement app. The **Collaborate** button and file share feature will only work with the record types listed below in Dynamisc 365 Customer Engagement app.

If not enabled, users can still connect Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps records to Microsoft Teams but the connected Microsoft Teams channel and the file library do not appear in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps.

When the feature is enabled, the collaboration feature is enabled only for a selected set of system entities. If you want to enable Microsoft Teams integration for additional entities or custom entities, you can only do it programmatically using the **msdyn_SetTeamsDocumentStatus** Web API action. More information: [Enable or disable Microsoft Teams Integration using code](../developer/integration-dev/teams-integration-using-code.md)

# Install and set up the Dynamics 365 app for Teams 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

## For Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement admins: enable Microsoft Teams integration feature 

By default, Microsoft Teams integration is disabled. To turn this feature on, follow the steps below. 

1. Sign in as a System administrator to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings** > **General** tab.
3. Enable **Microsoft Teams Integration**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Settings page](media/teams-system-settings.png "Settings page")

When Microsoft Teams Integration is enabled, the **Collaborate** button appears on records in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps so you can see the connected team channel. In addition, in the **Documents** tab of Dynamics 365 record page, the connected Teams Channel file library will appear.   

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If not enabled, users can still connect Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps records to Microsoft Teams but the connected Microsoft Teams channel and the file library do not appear in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps.  

## Install the app and set up the Teams tab

1. In Microsoft Teams, select **Store**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select Store](media/select-store.png "Select Store")

2. Search for **dynamics**, and then select the **Dynamics 365** tile.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Search for and select Dynamics 365](media/teams-search-select-dynamics-365-app.png "Search for and select Dynamics 365")

3. Verify that **Add for you** and **Add to a team** are both set to **Yes**.

   You can use Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps for your own use or use on a Microsoft Teams channel to collaborate with others. If you have an existing Microsoft Teams channel, select both options. Otherwise, you can start installing for your personal use and install the app for your Teams later.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Enable personal and team features](media/teams-store-install-both75.png "Enable personal and team features")

4. For **Add to a team**, choose a team and then select **Install**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Add to team](media/teams-store-install-add-team75.png "Add to team")

5. Pick a channel in Microsoft Teams to connect to a Dynamics record and then select **Set up**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Pick a channel and select Set up](media/teams-install-app-step2.png "Pick a channel and select Set up")


6. Select a version 9.x environment and a Unified Interface app to connect, and then choose **Save**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select environment and app module](media/teams-fre-org-app.png "Select environment and app module")

   > [!NOTE]
   > - Only Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement version 9.x or later environments appear in the list. Also, only active environments (those that are not disabled or provisioning) are displayed. 
   > - Only Unified Interface apps are listed.
   > - Only app modules licensed for the selected environment are listed. 

7. Select **Entity Selection** or **View Selection**.

    7.1 **Entity Selection**: Select an entity to connect. You can pick a recently viewed record or use search to find records. You can     use **Filter by** to narrow the search to an entity type. Once you've picked a record, select **Save**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select an entity](media/teams-add-channel-pin-record2.png "Select an entity")

    7.2 **View Selection**: Select an entity to see the list of available views. Once you've picked a view, select **Save**.
    
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select a view](media/teams-select-view.png "Select an view")
   
      > [!NOTE]
   > If you select a personal view (**My Views**) instead of **System Views**, it’s recommended that you share the view with other users in Teams before you add the view to the Teams channel. Otherwise, other team members will not hae access to the view content.


8. After completing the above steps, you will see a new tab for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps for the selected Teams channel.

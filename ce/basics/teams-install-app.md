## For Dynamics 365 (online) admins: enable Microsoft Teams integration Preview features

Because this is a preview feature, you can control whether to display Teams integration in Dynamics 365 (online). For full Teams integration, the Dynamics 365 (online) admin should enable two settings.

1. Sign in as a System administrator to Dynamics 365 (online).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings** > **Previews** tab.
3. Enable **Microsoft Teams Integration Preview** and **Dynamics 365 bot in Microsoft Teams Preview**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/teams-system-settings.png "Enable preview settings")

The following table describes what happens when each feature is enabled.

|Setting  |When enabled |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft Teams Integration Preview   | When enabled, the **Collaborate** button appears on records in Dynamics 365 (online) so you can see the connected team channel. In addition, in the **Documents** tab, files synchronized with Teams will appear.         |
|Dynamics 365 bot in Microsoft Teams Preview     | When enabled, the bot appears in Microsoft Teams in the **Conversation** tab in the Dynamics 365 app for Teams.  |

If these settings are not enabled, users can still connect Dynamics 365 (online) record to Microsoft Teams but the related Microsoft Teams channel and document do not appear in Dynamics 365 (online).

   > ![](media/teams-install-app-step2.png "Install the Dynamics 365 app, step 2")

4. Connect the app with Dynamics 365 (online). Select the Dynamics 365 app for Teams from the left-side menu.

Teams is now connected with Dynamics 365 (online).


   If you have multiple organizations or app modules, select **Edit** (![Edit](media/edit-icon.png "Edit")) to specify which org or app module to use in Teams.
 
   ![Specify org and app](media/teams-change-org-app.png "Specify org and app")

   Enable **Remember this preference** to set the org and app selections to be the default personal dashboard that appears when you select **My Dashboard**.

   Use the **Settings** tab in the Teams app to change these settings any time.

 5. Select **Save**. 

Once you complete the above steps, the Dynamics 365 tab appears in the menu bar.

You can interact with the record as if you were using the Dynamics 365 web app. Those with Write permissions can edit the record; changes will be synchronized with the Dynamics 365 web app.

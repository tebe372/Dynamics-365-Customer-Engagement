# Frequently Asked Questions about Activities and Timeline Wall  

## Is a title required when adding a new note?

When adding a note on any activity, the title of the note is not mandatory even if on the Note form the tile is a mandatory field. The title attribute will show as required in form designer but will not be required at runtime. This is a known issue in the legacy Web Client.

# Deactivate or activate an account or contact

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], you deactivate an account or contact rather than deleting it. This ensures the integrity of the audit trail associated with that record.  
  
 A deactivated account or contact becomes inactive, which means that it cannot be edited or used in establishing new relationships with other records. However, all relationships created with the deactivated item are still available.  
  
 Deactivated accounts can subsequently be reactivated should the need arise.  
  
## Deactivate an account or contact  
  
1.  Go to **Accounts** or **Contacts**. [How do I get there?](../basics/navigation-customer-engagement-enterprise.md)  
  
2.  Select the active account or contact that you want to deactivate, click or tap **Deactivate**, and then confirm the deactivation.  
  
## Activate an account or contact  
  
1.  Go to **Accounts** or **Contacts**. [How do I get there?](../basics/navigation-customer-engagement-enterprise.md)  
  
2.  To view a deactivated account or contact, in the **System Views** list, select **Inactive Accounts** or **Inactive Contacts**.  
  
3.  Select the inactive accounts or contacts you want to activate, click or tap **Activate**, and then confirm the activation.

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) 
and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, 
if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft
*	updates,
*	supplements,
*	Internet-based services, and
*	support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE 
SOFTWARE.  
If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.
1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 
a.	Installation and Use. 
*	You may install and use any number of copies of the software on Android OS-based devices that you own or 
control to test how it runs with your programs. This software requires connection to computer systems which 
have valid Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online subscription license. 
*	You may not test the software in a live operating environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under 
another agreement.
b.	Third Party Programs. The software may contain third party code that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses 
to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code are included for your information only.
c.	Collection of Data. IF YOU USE THE SOFTWARE TO CONNECT TO MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE, BY 
INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE, YOU CONSENT THE TRANSMISSION OF YOUR ORGANIZATION's OR END USER's 
ID, OR DEVICE ID TO MICROSOFT FOR PURPOSES OF ENABLING CONNECTIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE DEVICES, 
OR IMPROVING MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE OR THE SOFTWARE.
2.	PERFORMANCE AND EXPERIENCE DATA.  
a.	Consent for Internet Based or Wireless Services.  Microsoft collects many kinds of information in order to 
effectively operate and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can. The software connects to 
computer systems over the Internet, which may include via a wireless network.  Using the software operates as 
your consent to the transmission of standard device information (including, but not limited to, technical 
information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals) and information about how you 
interact with the software including the screens you visit and features you use.  Please review our Privacy 
Statement for more information.  
b.	Misuse of Internet Based Services. You may not use any Internet-based service in any way that could harm 
it or impair anyone else's use of it or the wireless network. You may not use the service to try to gain 
unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means. 
3.	TERM. The term of this agreement is until 30/06/2016 (day/month/year), or commercial release of the software, 
whichever is first.
4.	PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. This software is a pre-release version. It may not work the way a final version of the 
software will. We may change it for the final, commercial version. We also may not release a commercial version.
5.	FEEDBACK. Because this is pre-release software, you agree to give feedback about the software to Microsoft. You 
give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any 
purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products, technologies and 
services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You 
will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to 
third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
6.	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The software, including its user interface, features and documentation, is 
confidential and proprietary to Microsoft and its suppliers.
a.	Use. For five years after installation of the software or its commercial release, whichever is first, you may not 
disclose confidential information to third parties. You may disclose confidential information only to your 
employees and consultants who need to know the information. You must have written agreements with them 
that protect the confidential information at least as much as this agreement.
b.	Survival. Your duty to protect confidential information survives this agreement.
c.	Exclusions. You may disclose confidential information in response to a judicial or governmental order. You must 
first give written notice to Microsoft to allow it to seek a protective order or otherwise protect the information. 
Confidential information does not include information that
*	becomes publicly known through no wrongful act;
*	you received from a third party who did not breach confidentiality obligations to Microsoft or its suppliers; or
*	you developed independently.
7.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the 
software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you 
may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical 
limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
*	work around any technical limitations in the software;
*	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law 
expressly permits, despite this limitation;
*	make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this 
limitation;
*	publish the software for others to copy;
*	rent, lease or lend the software;
*	transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
*	use the software for commercial software hosting services.
8.	DOCUMENTATION. You may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.
9.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply 
with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include 
restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.
10.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is "as is," we may not provide support services for it.  Your device 
manufacturer and your wireless carrier are not responsible for providing support services for the software. If you have any 
issues with this software or questions about your use, including questions about your company's privacy policy, 
please contact your company's IT Administrator. Do not contact Microsoft, the application store owner, your network 
operator, or device manufacturer.

Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries. Android is a trademark of Google Inc.
12.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and 
support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
13.	APPLICABLE LAW.
a.	United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the 
interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. 
The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection 
laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
b.	Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.
14.	LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your 
country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement 
does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.
15.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS 
AVAILABLE."  YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT.  MICROSOFT AND WIRELESS CARRIERS OVER WHOSE 
NETWORK THE SOFTWARE IS DISTRIBUTED, AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, AND 
SUPPLIERS ("COVERED PARTIES"), GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS 
UNDER OR IN RELATION TO THE SOFTWARE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
THE SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE SOFTWARE BE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF 
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING OR REPAIR.  YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR 
LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL 
LAWS, COVERED PARTIES EXCLUDE THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
FOR AUSTRALIA ONLY.  YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER 
LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.
16.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND 
ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO ONE U.S. DOLLAR ($1.00).  YOU AGREE NOT TO SEEK TO 
RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR 
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES FROM ANY COVERED PARTIES.
This limitation applies to

programs; and 
*	claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee or condition; consumer protection; deception; unfair 
competition; strict liability, negligence, misinterpretation, omission, trespass or other tort; violation of statute or 
regulation; or unjust enrichment; all to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if 
*	Repair, replacement or refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or
*	Covered Parties knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.

# Implement claims-based authentication: internal access

[!INCLUDE [cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

Enabling claims-based authentication for internal access to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] data involves the following steps:  
  
1.  Deploy and configure [!INCLUDE[pn_adfs_short](../includes/pn-adfs-short.md)].  
  
2.  Configure the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server for claims-based authentication.  
  
3.  Configure the [!INCLUDE[pn_adfs_short](../includes/pn-adfs-short.md)] server for claims-based authentication.  
  
4.  Test internal claims-based authentication.  
  
 Claims-based authentication is not a requirement for intranet [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] access. However, claims-based authentication is required for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] IFD access.

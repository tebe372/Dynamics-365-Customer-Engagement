# Microsoft SQL Server hardware requirements for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement Server

[!INCLUDE [cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

You need [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)] database engine and [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] to install and run on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)]. The following table lists the minimum and recommended hardware requirements for [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)]. These requirements assume that additional components such as [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_full](../includes/pn-exchange-server-full.md)] arenâ€™t installed or running on the system.  
  
|Component|\*Minimum|\*Recommended|  
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|  
|Processor|x64 architecture or compatible dual-core 1.5 GHz processor|Quad-core x64 architecture 2 GHz CPU or higher such as AMD Opteron or Intel Xeon systems|  
|Memory|4 GB RAM|16 GB RAM or more|  
|Hard disk|SAS RAID 5 or RAID 10 hard disk array|SAS RAID 5 or RAID 10 hard disk array|  
  
 \*Actual requirements and product functionality might vary based on your system configuration and operating system.  
  
 Maintaining [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] databases on a computer that has less than the recommended requirements may result in inadequate performance.  
  
 The minimum and recommended requirements are based on 320-user load simulation tests.

# Add a new Deployment Administrator

[!INCLUDE [cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

You can grant or remove the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role in the **Deployment Administrators** node in [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)].  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can implement the procedure described here by using a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlet. For more information, see [Using Windows PowerShell to perform Deployment Manager tasks](powershell-deployment-manager-tasks.md).  


### Add a Deployment Administrator  
  
1.  In the console tree, right-click **Deployment Administrators**, and then select **New [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)]**.  
  
2.  In the **Select User** dialog box, in the **Enter object name to select** box, type the name of a user, who must exist in [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)], and then select **Check Names**.

# Create and use agent experience profiles

## Introduction

By default, the following app profiles are available out of the box for Customer Service workspace and Omnichannel for Customer Service. These profiles can't be deleted or modified. When no app profile is assigned to an agent, the default profile is assigned.

- Customer Service workspace - default profile
- Customer Service workspace + channels - default profile

The app profile manager is available in Power Apps where you'll create the app profiles.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the App Profile Manager Administrator role. More information: [Security roles](security-roles.md)

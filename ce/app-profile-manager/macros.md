# Automate tasks with macros 


## Overview of macros

In the customer service industry, agents have to click often to perform simple tasks, such as open a form, fill, and save it, and many repetitive and monotonous actions, such as greet a customer, verify a customer, send acknowledgment mail, and take notes. These clicks and repetitive tasks can lead to human errors while agents copy and paste the data across different operations.

Macros help address these challenges by helping users perform daily operations in a faster, more efficient, and process-compliant manner. Macros are a set of sequential actions that are performed by a user. You can reuse macros with different sessions based on the context parameters that are specific to the session.

The value propositions of the macros are as follows:

- Automate repetitive and monotonous tasks with a single click.

- Minimize human errors.

- Adhere to business processes.

- Lower average handling time.

- Improve customer satisfaction.

- Create contextual and reusable macros.

The macros in Omnichannel for Customer Service have the following:

- [Predefined automation actions](#predefined-automation-actions)
- [Built-in](#built-in)

## Prerequisites

- Install Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools solution.

- Ensure that you have the **Productivity tools administrator** security role. To learn more, see [Assign roles and enable users](../customer-service/add-users-assign-roles.md).

- Ensure that agents and supervisors are assigned the **Productivity tools user** security role. To learn more, see [Assign roles and enable users](../customer-service/add-users-assign-roles.md).

## Predefined automation actions

In Customer Service, macros provide three connectors:

- [Productivity automation](#productivity-automation): Provides actions to perform model-driven app operations.

- [Session connector](#session-connector): Provides actions to perform session-related operations.

- [Omnichannel connector](#omnichannel-connector): Provides actions to perform Omnichannel for Customer Service&ndash;related operations.

### Productivity automation

As an administrator, you can use the actions any number of times across different macros to automate and perform model-driven app operations.

The following screenshot shows the actions that are explained in the subsequent sections.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Macro actions for flow connector.](../customer-service/media/macro-flow-connector.png "Macro actions for flow connector")

#### Run Flow

This action is used to trigger Power Automate flows using macros in agent scripts. This action contains the following fields.

| Field                | Description                             | Parameter  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------|
| Entity logical name	 | Specify the logical name of the entity that you want to link. This is a mandatory field. Any Microsoft Dataverse entity, such as Account, can be used based on business needs. | Account   |
| Entity record id     | Specify the entity record ID of the entity that you want to link. This is a mandatory field. Ids or slugs, such as {customerRecordId}, can be used. While this field is labeled as entity record id, any value to be processed can be passed. While the field is required, values do not have to be functional unless required for the flow logic. | {customerRecordId}   |
| Select flow	         | Specify or select the Power Automate flow to be run by this action. Requires instant cloud flows with *When a record is selected* flow triggers. Existing flows with proper permissions will be detected and displayed in the drop-down list. |    |

#### Power Automate flow permissions

Referenced flows require valid connection and run permissions for the Omnichannel for Customer Service tenant and agents that run the flow from within agent scripts.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Flow permissions.](../customer-service/media/flow-permissions.png "Flow permissions")

When you run the **Run flow** action, flows are run within the embedded flow widget on Omnichannel for Customer Service.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Run Flow.](../customer-service/media/run-flow.png "Run Flow")


## Built-in

The Built-in control allows you to run a macro action step based on the conditions. The **Built-in** category connector has a **Condition** action.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Condition connector.](../customer-service/media/built-in.png "Condition connector")

To use the **Built-in** category, you first need to have a trigger (predefined automation actions). That is, select a predefined automation action first, and before or after a step, you can define the condition. You can also create nested conditions as per your requirements.

Using the **View run history** option for a particular macro, you can see the condition that was run and whether it succeeded.

For example, you want to open a new form and save it after entering the fields. If the **Product** field in the form has **Surface** as the value, evaluate it as true and then perform the knowledge base article search with the search phrase as **Surface**. If it is evaluated as false, don't perform any further actions.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Macro conditional builder.](../customer-service/media/macro-condition.png "Macro conditional builder")

## Use the automation dictionary to pass macro context data parameters

Macros are a set of configured actions that are run on demand by users. As an administrator, you need to configure the actions that a macro must perform. To configure the actions, you need to provide certain data parameters keys. When an agent runs the macro, these data parameters keys are replaced by contextual values.

To learn about the slugs for productivity tools, see [Slugs](automation-dictionary-keys.md#slugs-for-productivity-tools-macros-and-agent-scripts).

To learn more, see [Use automation dictionary to pass data parameter keys](automation-dictionary-keys.md#pass-data-parameter-in-macros-and-agent-scripts).

## Create a macro

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2142083), and go to the app profile manager page.
2. In the left pane, under **Productivity**, select **Agent scripts**. The Unified Interface page opens on a new tab.

3. On the page that appears, select **New**.

4. On the **Create macros** page, specify the following.

    | Field | Description | Example value |

    | Name | Provide a name to the macro. The name is displayed to the agent at runtime. | Create case |
    | Description | Describe the purpose of the macro. The description is displayed to the agent at runtime. | This macro action is used to create a case. |
    |||

5. Select **Start macro execution**, and then select **New step**.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Create macro.](../customer-service/media/create-macro1.png "Create a macro")

6. Select a connector from the list. The following connectors are available:

   - [Productivity Automation](#productivity-automation)
   - [Session Connector](#session-connector)
   - [Omnichannel Connector](#omnichannel-connector)

7. Select an action from the list of actions. You can add as many actions as you need, based on your business requirements.

   If you select **Productivity Automation**, you'll see the following actions.

    | Purpose | Action name |
    |-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
    | Open a new form to create a record | Create new |
    | Open an existing form | Open form |
    | Open a record grid | Open grid |

    | Refresh the application tab | Refresh tab |
    | Focus on a particular application tab from another application tab| Focus tab |
    | Get the details of the current application tab | Get current tab |
    |||

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Macro actions for session.](../customer-service/media/macro-session-connector.png "Macro actions for session")    

   To learn more, see [Session connector](#session-connector).

   If you select **Omnichannel connector**, you'll see the following actions.

    | Purpose | Action name |
    |-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
    | Link a record to the conversation while interacting with the customer | Link record to the conversation |
    | Unlink a record from the conversation while interacting with the customer | Unlink record from the conversation |
    |||

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Macro actions for Omnichannel.](../customer-service/media/macro-omnichannel-connector.png "Macro actions for Omnichannel") 

   To learn more, see [Omnichannel connector](#omnichannel-connector).
   
   > [!Note]
   > Omnichannel connector is not available in Customer Service workspace.

8. Specify the values in the fields. To learn how to specify the values, see [Use automation dictionary to pass data parameters keys](automation-dictionary-keys.md).

   If you selected **Open a new form to create a record**, you can select **Show advanced options** to add the attributes and values you want. If required, you can select **+ Add new item** to add more attributes.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Attributes for Open a new form to create a record.](../customer-service/media/macro-fields.png "Attributes for Open a new form to create a record") 

9. After you add an action step, to define conditions, select the **Built-in** tab, and select **Control**.

10. Select **Condition** to define the conditions. The condition has **If true** or **If false**. Define the condition as per your requirement.

11. To add another action step, repeat step 7 and optionally step 8.

12. Select **Save and close**.

Now, when the agent runs the macro, the actions will be run by fetching the data parameter keys according to the context available from the sources. To learn more, see [Use automation dictionary to pass data parameters keys](automation-dictionary-keys.md).

## View macro run history

As an administrator, you can view the macro run history, which shows how many times a macro has been run, along with the success or fail status. When you select a macro that failed, you can view the exact action step at which the failure occurred.

1. In the site map of Omnichannel admin center, select **Agent experience** under **Advanced settings**, and then select **Manage** for **Macros**. If you're using the Omnichannel Administration app, under **Agent Experience**, select **Macros**.

2. Select the macro for which you want to view the history.

3. Select **View run history**.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![View the run history for a macro.](../customer-service/media/macro-run-history.png "View the run history for a macro")

4. Select the macro that failed from the list.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Select the macro that failed.](../customer-service/media/macro-run-history-list.png "Select the macro that failed")

5. See the macro action step that caused the failure. Review the previous step for any issue in the slug data parameters that might've been passed incorrectly or slug data parameters that were updated incorrectly.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Review the macro action steps.](../customer-service/media/macro-run-history-fail.png "Review the macro action steps")

   For example, when you select on the **Open a new form to create a record** step, select **Show more**, and you can view that the mandatory fields don't have values, which are mandatory to save the record. Due to this reason, the macro run failed at the **Save the record** step.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Review the macro action steps to understand failure reason.](../customer-service/media/macro-run-history-fail-reason.png "Review the macro action steps to understand failure reason")

6. Fix the macro step action that you think might have caused the failure, and then try running it again. For example, since the values are not resolved, go to the macro designer and then check on the slugs, and then try running the macro again.

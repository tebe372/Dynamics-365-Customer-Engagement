## Introduction

This topic discusses how to use the app profile manager to create app profiles and assign them to users.

By default, the following app profiles are available out of the box for Customer Service workspace and Omnichannel for Customer Service. These profiles can't be deleted or modified. When no app profile is assigned to an agent, the default profile is assigned.

- Omnichannel for Customer Service - default profile
- Customer Service workspace - default profile

The app profile manager is available in Power Apps where you'll create the app profiles.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the App profile manager administrator role. More information: [Security roles](security-roles.md)

## Create an app profile

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2142083).
2. Select the environment in which you want to create the app profiles.
3. Do one of the following:
   - On the **Home** page, go to **Your apps** section.
   - In the left pane, select **Apps**.
4. Select **More commands** beside **Omnichannel for Customer Service** or **Customer Service workspace (Preview)**, and then select **App profile manager** on the menu that appears.
5. In the left pane, select **App profiles**.
6. On the **App profile manager** page, select **New profile**.
7. On the **New profile** pane, specify the following:
   - **Name:** The app profile name.
   - **Unique name:** A unique identifier in the <*prefix*>_<*name*> format.
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > The following are required for the unique name:
     > - The prefix can only be alphanumeric and its length must be between 3 to 8 characters.
     > - An underscore must be there between the prefix and name.
   - **Description:** A description for the profile.
  
### Add templates and enable productivity pane and channels<a name="enable-prod-pane"></a>

For an app profile, you can add only one session template for each entity type. Typically, you will add one session template for each entity type, such as one each session template for accounts, contacts, and cases. The settings that you enable for the app profile will be available for agents and supervisor only when you configure the corresponding templates and settings in the Customer Service Hub app or Omnichannel Administration app. For example, channels must be provisioned in Omnichannel for Customer Service and channel instances must be configured.

1. In the **App profiles** section, select the app profile to which you want to assign templates.
2. On the **Session templates**, select **Add entity session template**.
3. Search for the template you want to add and select it. Make sure that the selected template is based on **Entity** type. More information: [Manage session templates](session-templates.md)

4. Do the following on the **Productivity pane** tab:
   1. If you want to enable productivity tools, set the toggle to on for **Turn on productivity pane**.
   2. Select the default mode as collapsed or expanded.
   3. In the **Productivity tools** section, set the toggle to on for **Smart assist tool configuration** and **Agent scripts** to allow access to smart assist configuration and agent scripts.
5. On the **Channels** tab, set the toggle to on for **All active channels**. The channels configured in Omnichannel for Customer Service will be available for the user to whom the profile is assigned.


   > [!NOTE]
   > The toggle for channels will be enabled in the out-of-the-box app profile for Omnichannel for Customer Service.

6. To add a third-party channel provider, in the **Voice channels** section, select **Add channel providers**, search for the configured channel, and select it.
7. If a channel does not exist, select **Create a new channel provider in Unified Interface**. The channel configuration page opens on a new tab. More information: [Configure channel provider using app profile manager](../customer-service/channel-integration-framework/v2/configure-channel-provider-app-profile-manager.md)

   > [!NOTE]
   > Only telephony or voice channels are supported.
  
### Assign profiles to users

1. On the **App profiles** page, select the profile that you want to assign to a user.
2. On the ***<profile_name>*** page, select **Assign users** on the command bar, and select **OK** on the message dialog box. The profile opens on a new tab.
   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]

4. On the **Lookup Records** pane, search and select the user.

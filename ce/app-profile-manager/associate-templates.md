6. Select the search icon in the **Look for Session Templates** lookup. The list of templates that you created appears. Select a template.

7. Remove the default notification template from the **Notifications** section.

8. Repeat step 6 to add templates for the following fields.

    - Incoming authenticated
    - Incoming unauthenticated
    - Consult
    - Transfer

9. Select **Save** to save the changes to the work stream.

# Associate templates with workstreams

The session, notification, and application tab templates that you create need to be associated with a workstream so that the Omnichannel system uses the corresponding templates for an incoming conversation.

After an agent accepts the conversation request, a session starts for which the session template is used. In the session, certain application tabs are required such as dashboard, knowledge article search, and case pages. These application tabs are configured using the application tab templates and are associated with a session.

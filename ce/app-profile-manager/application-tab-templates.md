## Introduction

An application tab template in Customer Service lets you specify the type of applications you want to open when a session is started. Each application type has a predefined set of parameters associated with it.

The horizontal bar beneath the model-driven app navigation bar is called the application tab panel. Every customer session has at least one application tab that can't be closed; it is called **Anchor Tab**. That is, when a session is started, by default the system opens an application in the application tab panel. In addition, there may be few other applications that system opens by default based on the configuration.

With application tab template, you can define the applications that are available for a session, and then associate the applications with a session.

For example, you can create the **Customer summary** application type and associate it with Chat and SMS session. Now, when an agent accepts the notification from  the chat or SMS channels, a session starts and by default the **Customer summary** page loads.

As an administrator, you can create multiple application tab templates.

  > [!Note]
  > You can't customize the out-of-the-box templates; instead, you'll need to create your own custom templates.

5. Select **Save**. After you save the template, the parameters for the application type that you selected appear in the **Parameters** section.

    Whenever you edit the application tab template, save the changes so you see the corresponding fields in the **Parameters** section.

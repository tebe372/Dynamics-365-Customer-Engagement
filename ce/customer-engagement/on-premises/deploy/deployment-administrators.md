# Deployment Administrators

[!INCLUDE [cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

To run [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)], you must have the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role. Deployment Administrators have unrestricted access to perform [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)] tasks on all organizations and servers in a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] deployment.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Make sure that at least two or three trusted people have the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role. This prevents system lockout if the primary deployment administrator is unavailable.  
  
 During [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] Setup, the user running Setup is automatically given the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role. A [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] can give the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role to other users in [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] directory service.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Users who have the [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role do not automatically become [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] users and do not consume a client access license (CAL).  
>   
>  The [!INCLUDE[pn_Deployment_Administrator](../includes/pn-deployment-administrator.md)] role cannot be managed in the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] client applications.

# Upgrading Dynamics 365 Server

[!INCLUDE [cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

This section provides best practices guidelines and procedures to install [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_server_2016_legacy](../includes/pn-crm-server-2016-legacy.md)] in a deployment that already has the previous version of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_legacy](../includes/pn-crm-legacy.md)] Server installed.  
  
## Upgrade options  
 There are three different upgrade options:  
  
-   **Migrate by using a new instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Server](../includes/pn-ms-sql-server.md)]**. We recommend this option for upgrading Dynamics 365 Server. Although this option requires a different computer for the new version of Dynamics 365 Server and a different instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)], it provides the least amount of potential downtime for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_legacy](../includes/pn-crm-legacy.md)] because the previous [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_legacy](../includes/pn-crm-legacy.md)] deployment can remain functioning until the upgrade is completed and verified.  
  
-   **Migrate by using the same instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)]**. This option requires a different computer for the new version of Dynamics 365 Server, but will upgrade in-place the configuration and default organization databases using the same instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)]. If issues occur during the upgrade, you must roll back to the previous deployment to avoid significant downtime.  
  
-   **In-place upgrade**. Although this option doesnâ€™t require a different computer for the new version of Dynamics 365 Server or a different instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_short](../includes/pn-sql-server-short.md)], it poses the greatest risk if upgrade issues occur because a roll back and reinstall of the previous deployment will be required to avoid potential downtime.

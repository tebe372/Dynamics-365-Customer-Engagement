# Delete (remove) a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Server

[!INCLUDE [cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

To delete a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] from a deployment, use the **Servers** area. However, before you can delete a server, you must disable it.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  After you delete a server, users might no longer be able to access or use the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] application, or use certain features, such as reporting. To restore a deleted server, you must run [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)] Setup and reinstall the server roles that were removed when the server was deleted.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  The procedure described here can be implemented by using a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlet. For more information, see the [Disable-CrmServer](/powershell/module/microsoft.crm.powershell/disable-crmserver?view=dynamics365ce-ps) and [Remove-CrmServer](/powershell/module/microsoft.crm.powershell/remove-crmserver?view=dynamics365ce-ps) commands.  
  
### Delete a server  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[pn_deploymentmanager](../includes/pn-deploymentmanager.md)] console tree, select **Servers**.  
  
2.  In the details pane, right-click the server that you want to delete, and then select **Disable**.  
  
3.  Select **Yes**.  
  
4.  After the server is disabled, in the details pane, right-click the server that you want to delete, and then select **Delete**.  
  
5.  Select **Yes**.

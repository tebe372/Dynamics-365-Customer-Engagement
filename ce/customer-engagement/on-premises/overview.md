# Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Help, version 9.x

Welcome to the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Help!

Starting October 2019, the **Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement** SKU/license plan is no longer available for "online" customers. More information: \<link to blog announcement>

With this change for *online* customers, we are no longer using the term "Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps" to refer to the collection of following apps and its related services:
- Dynamics 365 Sales
- Dyanmics 365 Customer Service
- Dynamics 365 Marketing 
- Dynamics 365 Field Service
- Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation

These apps for *online* customers are in fact model-driven apps running on the [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) platform. You can build model-driven apps using PowerApps. More information: [What are model-driven apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview)

For *on-premises* users, "Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)" is the official name of the product that provides sales, service and marketing features. Customer Engagement (on-premises) shares lot of features in common with the Common Data Service platform and PowerApps. 

To avoid duplicating the common information between Customer Engagement (on-premises) and PowerApps/Common Data Service documentation, you will find a lot of reference and links from this guide pointing to the Common Data Service and PowerApps documentation.

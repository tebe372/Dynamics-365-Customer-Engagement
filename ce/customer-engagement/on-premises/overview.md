# Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Help, version 9.x

Welcome to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Help!

Starting October 2019, the **Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement** SKU/license plan is no longer available for "online" customers. More information: <link to blog announcement>

With this change, we are no longer using the term "Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps" to refer to the collection of apps that include Sales, Customer Service, Marketing, Field Service, Project Service Automation, and their related services. These apps meant for online customers are now referred to as Dynamics 365 apps, and are in fact model-driven apps running on the [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) platform. You can build your own model-driven apps using PowerApps. More information: [What are model-driven apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview)

For on-premises users, "Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)" is the official name of the product. Customer Engagement (on-premises) shares lot of features in common with the **Common Data Service** platform. 

To avoid duplicating the common information between Customer Engagement (on-premises) and PowerApps/Common Data Service documentation, you will find a lot of reference and links pointing to the PowerApps/Common Data Service from this guide.

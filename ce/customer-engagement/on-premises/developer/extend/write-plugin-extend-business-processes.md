# Write plug-ins to extend business processes

Whenever possible, you should first consider applying one of the several declarative process options to define or apply business logic. More information: [Automate your business processes in Customer Engagement apps](automate-business-processes-customer-engagement.md).

When a declarative process doesn’t meet a requirement, as a developer you have several options. This topic will introduce common options to write code.

A plug-in is custom business logic that you can integrate with [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] to modify or augment the standard behavior of the platform. Plug-ins are event handlers since they are registered to execute in response to a particular event being fired by the platform.
  
 The following topics describe how to add custom business logic to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] through the development and registration of plug-ins. For more information about the run-time execution of plug-ins and the plug-in development framework, see [Event Framework](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/event-framework).

Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement (on-premises) is built on the [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro
) platform, which is also the underlying data platform for PowerApps. If you are a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement (on-premises) user, you continue to use the on-premises Customer Engagement platform that has similar functionality as Common Data Service.

# Use Single-Tenant Server-to-server authentication

The single-tenant server-to-server scenario typically applies for enterprise organizations who have multiple [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-online.md)] organizations using [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Dir_Fed_Svcs_AD_FS](../includes/pn-active-dir-fed-svcs-ad-fs.md)] for authentication. However, it can also be applied by organizations using [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-online-subsequent.md)] when the application will not be distributed to other [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] organizations.
  
 An enterprise can create a web application or service to connect to all the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] organizations for the single tenant.  
  
## Differences from multi-tenant scenario  
 Creating a web application or service for a single-tenant server-to-server authentication is similar to that used for a multi-tenant organization but there are some important differences.  
  
-   Because all the organizations are in the same tenant, there is no need for a tenant admin to grant consent. The application is already registered on the tenant.  
  
-   You have the opportunity to use certificates rather than keys if you prefer.

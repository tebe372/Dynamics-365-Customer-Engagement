*This content also applies to the on-premises version.*

Managing data in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps includes importing data into [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps, cleaning up duplicate records, deleting data in bulk, and securing sensitive data through data encryption.

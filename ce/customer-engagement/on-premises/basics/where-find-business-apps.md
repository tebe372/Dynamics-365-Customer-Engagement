# Where to find your business apps

Business apps are available to users based on their security roles. If your system administrator has created any new apps,  they will be visible to you if your security role has been given access to those apps. For information on business apps in [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_short](../includes/pn-moca-short.md)], see [Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets - User's Guide](../mobile-app/dynamics-365-phones-tablets-users-guide.md). 
  
## Open business apps from the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)home page  
 This option is available only to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)apps customers.  
  
1. Sign in to the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] admin center at: https://admin.microsoft.com.  
  
2. Click the App Launcher button ![App launcher](../basics/media/app-chooser.png "App launcher") in the upper-left corner, and then click Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).  
  
    The Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) home page opens, which is where you'll find all your Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). You'll see all published business apps based on your organization's licensing options, and your security role.  
  
3. Click the app that you want to use.  
  
    Once you're in an app, you can switch to other apps by using the app switcher. In the top-left corner, click the down arrow beside   ![Dynamics 365 app switcher](../basics/media/app-switcher-arrow-button.png "Dynamics 365 app switcher"). Then, click **My Apps**, and search for your app.  
  
   [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Quickly navigate with the Office 365 app launcher and the Dynamics 365 home page](../admin/quickly-navigate-office-365-app-launcher.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you are a system administrator or customizer or a user with equivalent privileges, you'll see apps in published as well as draft states.  
  
## Open business apps from the My Apps page  
 This option is available to both online and on-premises customers.  
  
1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) apps.  
  
2. Go to **Settings** > **My Apps**.  
  
    The page shows all published [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps based on your organization's licensing options, and your security role.  
  
    You can also directly open the My Apps page by entering the following URL in your browser:  http://\<server name>/\<orgName>/apps.  
  
    The My Apps page has two views: Published Apps and Apps Being Edited. All draft apps are available in the **Apps Being Edited** view. All published apps are available in the **Published Apps** view.  
  
3. In the **Published Apps** view, click the app that you want to use.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you are a system administrator, a customizer or a user with equivalent privileges, you'll see apps in published as well as draft states.  
  
When you use an app, you'll see only those entities in the site map  and other places in the app that your system administrator has added while designing the app.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> - The Quick Create menu, Global Search, and Recent Records within the app aren't filtered. These show and can be searched on all entities instead of only the entities that are added to the app.  
>   -   When you search using Advanced Find, it searches all entities and not just the entities added to the app.  

## Apps you might see in the app switcher

Depending on the installation options your admin chooses when setting up [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps, you may see any of the following apps in the app switcher:

# Work with accounts and contacts in Customer Engagement apps

Account and contact records store much of the information that you and your team collect from your customers.
You store data about companies you do business with in accounts. Similar to Microsoft Office Outlook or other email programs, you store data about the people you know and work with in contacts.

Usually, an account has more than one contact associated with it, especially when you’re working with a larger company with many departments or locations and you deal with several people to manage the account.
 
## Create or edit an account
If you work mostly with other companies, you’ll probably want to use accounts to keep track of them. Learn how to import accounts: [Import accounts, leads, or other data](../basics/import-accounts-leads-other-data.md)

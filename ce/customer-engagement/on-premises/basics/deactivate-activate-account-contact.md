# Deactivate or activate an account or contact

In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], you deactivate an account or contact rather than deleting it. This ensures the integrity of the audit trail associated with that record.  
  
 When a deactivated account or contact becomes inactive, it cannot be edited. However, it can still be used to establish new relationships with other records. All relationships created with the deactivated item are still available.  
  
 Deactivated accounts can subsequently be reactivated should the need arise.  
  
## Deactivate an account or contact  
  
1.  Go to **Accounts** or **Contacts**. [How do I get there?](../basics/navigation-customer-engagement-enterprise.md)  
  
2.  Select the active account or contact that you want to deactivate, click or tap **Deactivate**, and then confirm the deactivation.  
  
## Activate an account or contact

# Download a report

To edit a default report, you can download the report from Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) to a computer that is set up with the report development environment, and then make the necessary changes.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_reports](../includes/proc-reports.md)]  
  
2. On the **Actions**![action](../basics/media/action-button.gif "action") menu, select **Download Report**.  
  
    The RDL file for the report contains tags that specify whether the report is a Fetch-based report or an SQL-based report.  
  
3. Select **Save**, and specify the location in which to save the file. If youâ€™re creating a new report rather than modifying a report, rename the file.  
  
4. In the **Download Complete** dialog box, select **Close**.

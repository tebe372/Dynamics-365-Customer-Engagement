# Collaborate with your team

[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] offers a number of tools for collaboration. Through integration with other Microsoft collaboration tools, users of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) can work closely with team members, even if they are not also users of the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).

- **[!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)]** - Out-of-the-box integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_groups](../includes/pn-office-365-groups.md)] for agenda, conversation, OneNote, documents, and member management. See [Collaborate with your colleagues using Office 365 Groups](../basics/collaborate-with-colleagues-using-office-365-groups.md).

- **[!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)]** - Store documents in your [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] workspace. See [Use OneDrive for Business to manage your private documents](../basics/use-onedrive-business-manage-private-documents.md).

- **[!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)]** - Access notes stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_onenote](../includes/pn-onenote.md)]. See [Use OneNote in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](../basics/use-onenote.md).

- **[!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)]** - Use one place to have conversations, create and edit documents, and share information with your colleagues without sending a single email or attending any meetings. See [Collaborate and communicate with Yammer](../basics/collaborate-communicate-with-yammer.md).

- **Microsoft Teams Integration** - Easily work with Dynamics 365 customer information and share files directly from Microsoft Teams. See [Microsoft Teams Integration](teams-integration.md).

# View relevant and trending information on a dashboard with Office Delve

Office Graph integration for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) will be removed on August 31, 2017, at the same time that [Office ends GQL query support](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/query-office-graph-using-gql-with-search-rest-api). Customers can continue to use Office Graph integration through August 31, 2017. After August 31 that date, the Office Graph trending documents component will cease to function and youâ€™ll see the following error message:

**We can't get to the trending documents. Try again later.**

To disable Office Graph:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Document Management** > **Office Graph Integration**.
2. Remove the Trending Documents dashboard component from existing dashboards.

For more information, see the blog: [Office Graph integration removal](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2017/07/31/office-graph-integration-removal/).

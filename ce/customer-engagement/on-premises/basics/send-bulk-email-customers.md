# Send bulk email to customers

You can send the same message to multiple recipients using email templates. This is known as *direct* or *bulk* emailing. You can also use mail merge with [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Word_short](../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Word_short](../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)] templates to create the message.  
  
1.  Go to your work area. [(How do I get there?)](../basics/navigation-customer-engagement-enterprise.md)  
  
2.  Choose the record type you want. For example, choose **Contacts**.  
  
3.  In the list of records, select the contacts you want to send email to.  
  
4.  In the web app: Click the **More Commands** button ![Ellipsis button](../basics/media/ellipsis-button.gif "Ellipsis button"), and then click **Send Direct Email**.  
  
<!-- > In Dynamics 365 for Outlook: In the **Collaborate** group, click **Send Direct Email**![send&#95;direct&#95;email](../basics/media/send-direct-email.gif "send_direct_email"). Or, just click **Send Direct Email** to send email to everyone on the list.  
-->   
5.  In the **Send Direct Email** dialog box, select the template you want to use.  
  
6.  Click **Send**.

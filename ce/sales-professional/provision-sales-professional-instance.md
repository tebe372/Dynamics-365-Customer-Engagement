# Provision your Dynamics 365 Sales Professional environment
Congratulations on the purchase of the Sales Professional application. 

Before you can start using the Sales Professional application you need to:

1.	Provision a new Dynamics 365 environment (instance)
2.	Install the Sales Professional solution on a Dynamics 365 environment (instance).

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator of your Microsoft 365 org (tenant) to perform both the above actions.

## Provision a new Dynamics 365 environment

You need a Dynamics 365 environment to install the Sales Professional application. If you already have a Dynamics environment, say from using another Dynamics 365 application that you are already using, and you want to install the Sales Professional app on that environment, see the steps in the [Install the Sales Professional solution on a Dynamics 365 environment](#install-app) section.

To provision a new Dynamics 365 environment:

1.	Go to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/homepage), and in the navigation pane, select **Show All**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select the Show all option in the Microsoft 365 admin center navigation pane](../sales-professional/media/microsoft-365-admin-center-sitemap-show-all.png "Select the Show all option in the Microsoft 365 admin center navigation pane")

2. In the navigation pane, under **Admin centers**, select **All admin centers**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select All admin centers in the navigation pane](../sales-professional/media/all-admin-centers-in-microsoft365-admin-center.png "Select All admin centers in the navigation pane")

3. Select **Dynamics 365**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Dynamics 365 option in the All admin centers page](../sales-professional/media/dynamics-365-admin-center-all-admin-centers.png "Dynamics 365 option in the All admin centers page")

    The Power Platform admin center opens.

4.	If you already have a Dynamics 365 environment and want to install Sales Professional in this environment, follow the steps in [Install the Sales Professional solution on a Dynamics 365 environment](#install-app).

    If you don't have any Dynamics environment yet, you'll need to create a new one. On the **Environments** page, select **New**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select New in Environments page](media/new-in-environments-page-m365-admin-center.png "Select New in Environments page")

5. Enter the following, and then select **Next**.
   
   |Setting  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Name     | The name of your environment.        |
   |Type     | Choose production, trial, or sandbox.        |
   |Region     | Choose a region for the environment.        |
   |Purpose     | A description of the environment.         |
   |Create a database for this environment? | Select **Yes**. |

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Configure instance page](media/new-environment-page1.png "Configure instance page")

6. Enter or review the following, and then select **Save**.

   |Setting  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Language     | The default language for this environment. More information: [Common Data Service language collations](/power-platform/admin/language-collations)     |
   |Currency     | The base currency used for reporting.         |
   |Enable Dynamics 365 apps | Select **Yes**. If this is set to **No**, a Common Data Service environment will be created and you won't be able to install Sales Professional on this environment. |
   |Security group | Select a security group to restrict access to this environment. |
   |Automatically deploy these apps | Select **Sales Pro** to install the Sales Professional app during the environment creation. Alternately, follow the steps in [Install the Sales Professional solution on a Dynamics 365 environment](#install-app) |

Make sure that all the quotes and invoices that your sales team sends out to customers follow a consistent format and branding by enabling automatic generation of quotes and invoices.

1.  Make sure you have a Sales Professional Manager or System Administrator role so that you can enable automatic generation of quotes or invoice documents.

2.  In the site map, select **Sales Settings**.

3.  Under **Advanced Settings**, select **Quote to invoice**.

4.  To enable automatic generation of quote documents, select the **Auto-generate quote as a Word document** check box, and then select the quote Word template from the drop-down list.

5.  To enable automatic generation of invoice documents, select the **Auto-generate invoice as a Word document** check box, and then select the invoice Word template from the drop-down list. All the out-of-the-box templates and the custom templates that youâ€™ve created are available in the drop-down list.

6.  Select **Save**.

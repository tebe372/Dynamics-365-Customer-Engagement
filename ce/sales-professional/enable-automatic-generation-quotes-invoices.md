Enable automatic generation of quotes and invoices
==================================================

Make sure that all the quotes or invoices that your sales team is sending out to
the customers follow a consistent format and branding by enabling automatic
generation of quotes and invoices.

1.  Make sure you have the Sales Manager – Business or a System Administrator
    role to be able to enable auto-generation of quotes or invoices documents.

2.  In the site map, select **Sales Settings**.

3.  Under **Advanced Settings**, select **Quote to invoice**.

4.  To enable automatic generation of quote documents, select the
    **Auto-generate quote as a Word document** check box, and then select the
    quote Word template from the drop-down list.

5.  To enable automatic generation of invoice documents, select the
    **Auto-generate invoice as a Word document** check box, and then select the
    invoice Word template from the drop-down list. All the out-of-the-box
    templates and the custom templates that you’ve created will be available in
    the drop-down list.

6.  Select **Save**.

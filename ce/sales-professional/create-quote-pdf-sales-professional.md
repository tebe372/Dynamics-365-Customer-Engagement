# Create PDF files from sales records

Use the PDF generation capability to create and share read-only, professional-looking PDF files for Dynamics 365 records with your customers. The PDF file is generated by using a standard Word template from your organization. The capability to create PDF files is available for the following entities: Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, Order, Quote, and Invoice.

Your system administrator can choose the entities for which PDF generation is enabled. If PDF generation isn't enabled, you won't see the option to create a PDF file. 

1. Open the entity record for which you want to create a PDF file&mdash;in this example, a record for a Quote entity.

2. On the command bar, select **Create PDF** and then select a template on which you want to create the PDF.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![A quote form showing the Create PDF button on the command bar](media/create-pdf-sales-professional.png "A quote form showing the Create PDF button on the command bar")


    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Templates are available out of the box for the Account, Opportunity, Order, Quote, and Invoice entities. For entities that do not have the out-of-the-box templates, you can create new templates. You can't create a PDF file for an entity record if there's no template available for that entity. 

    > [!TIP]
    > To learn more about using Word templates, see [Use Word templates to create standardized documents](../admin/using-word-templates-dynamics-365.md). 

3. In the dialog box that appears, save or download the PDF.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![A quote form showing the Create PDF button on the command bar](../sales-enterprise/media/save-or-download-pdf-document.png "A quote form showing the Create PDF button on the command bar")
    
    - If you select **Save**, the PDF file is stored in the default SharePoint site if SharePoint is configured and enabled for the Quote entity. If SharePoint isn't configured, the **Save** option saves the PDF as a Notes attachment to the Quote record in Dynamics 365 Sales. 
    - If you select the **Download** option, the PDF is downloaded to your local drive. After it's downloaded, you can add this file to a note, send it as an attachment in an email, or upload it to SharePoint.
    
## Email as a PDF file

You can also generate a PDF file and directly email it to a customer.

1. Open an entity record. For example, open a quote record.

2. On the command bar, select **Email as PDF** and then select a document template.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![A quote form showing the Email as PDF button on the command bar](media/email-as-pdf-sales-professional.png "A quote form showing the Email as PDF button on the command bar")
    
    An email form opens. 
    
    The following information is automatically populated.

    |Field             |    Populated with                                 |
    |------------------|-------------------------------------------------| 
    |**To**                |    Potential customer, if applicable                |
    |**From**                 |  Current user                                   |
    |**Attachments**       |    The generated PDF, added as an attachment         |
    |**Regarding**           |  Record from which the email was triggered| 
    |**Subject**             |  Title of the record                                    |

3. Verify and change any details in the email form, and then select **Send**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The time taken to generate the PDF file and download or send the email depends on the size of the file. You'll see optimum performance when the file size is less than 2 MB. Larger files can require considerably more response time.

# Create PDF files from sales records

Use the PDF generation capability to create and share read-only, professional-looking PDF files for Dynamics 365 records with your customers. The PDF file is generated by using a standard Word template from your organization. The capability to create PDF files is available for the following entities: Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, Order, Quote, and Invoice.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the 2020 release wave 2, the PDF generation capability is enhanced to support all custom entities. The PDF enhancements are limited to the web experience and aren't available in the mobile app. If you haven't opted in, or you're using Sales Professional on a mobile app, you'll see the old experience.

Your system administrator can choose the entities for which PDF generation is enabled. If PDF generation isn't enabled, you won't see the option to create a PDF file. 

1. Open the entity record for which you want to create a PDF fileâ€”in this example, a record for the Opportunity entity.
2. On the command bar, select **Export to PDF**.

    The **Export to PDF** dialog box appears.

    ![Export to PDF dialog box](../sales-enterprise/media/export-to-pdf-dialog.png "Export to PDF dialog box")

    A preview based on the selected template is shown, and the PDF file name is populated. If you'd like to use a different template than the one selected, search for and select it in the **Select a template to generate PDF document** box. After you select the template, the preview will be refreshed.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > - Templates are available out of the box for the Account, Opportunity, Order, Quote, and Invoice entities. For entities that don't have out-of-the-box templates, you can create new templates. You can't create a PDF file for an entity record if there's no template available for that entity. To learn more about using Word templates, see [Use Word templates to create standardized documents](/power-platform/admin/using-word-templates-dynamics-365). 
    > - If there are multiple Word templates available for the entity, by default the first template in the list is selected. 
    > - If the setting to view or download a PDF file automatically is disabled in your browser settings, the preview functionality won't work. 

3. In the **Save as** field, change the PDF file name if you want.
4. Do one of the following:
   1. To download the PDF file to your computer, select **Download**.
   2. To send the PDF file to your customer in email, select **Email**. 

      In the email form that opens, the following information is automatically populated.

      |Field             |    Populated with                                 |
      |------------------|-------------------------------------------------|  
      |**To**                |    Potential customer, if applicable                |
      |**From**                 |  The current user                                   |
      |**Attachments**       |    The generated PDF file, added as an attachment         |
      |**Regarding**           |  The record from which the email was triggered    | 
      |**Subject**             |  The title of the record      |

      ![Email form with a PDF file attached](../sales-enterprise/media/email-form-pdf-attachment.png "Email form with a PDF file attached")

      > [!NOTE]
      > The **Regarding** field isn't populated if the **Sending email** flag in the primary entity isn't enabled in the **Customization** area. For more information about this flag, see [Entity options that can only be enabled](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/edit-entities#entity-options-that-can-only-be-enabled). 

    3. Select **Save to SharePoint** or **Save to Dynamics**.
      - Use **Save to SharePoint** to save the PDF file to a SharePoint site. This button is available when SharePoint integration is enabled for your organization and the **Document Management** check box is selected on the entity page in the **Customization** area. If you don't see this button, contact your system administrator.
      - If SharePoint integration isn't enabled, you'll see the **Save to Dynamics** button. This command saves the PDF file as a note to the primary record. The **Save to Dynamics** button is available if notes are enabled for the primary entity. If you don't see this button, contact your system administrator.  

## Steps for creating a PDF file if you're using Dynamics 365 for phones on a mobile device

If you haven't opted in for the 2020 release wave 2 features, or if you're using Sales Professional on the mobile app, the capability for generating PDF files is limited to the following entities: Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, Order, Quote, and Invoice. 

1. Open the entity record for which you want to create a PDF file&mdash;in this example, a record for a Quote entity.

2. On the command bar, select **Create PDF** and then select a template on which you want to create the PDF.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![A quote form showing the Create PDF button on the command bar](media/create-pdf-sales-professional.png "A quote form showing the Create PDF button on the command bar")


    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Templates are available out of the box for the Account, Opportunity, Order, Quote, and Invoice entities. For entities that do not have the out-of-the-box templates, you can create new templates. You can't create a PDF file for an entity record if there's no template available for that entity. 

    > [!TIP]
    > To learn more about using Word templates, see [Use Word templates to create standardized documents](/power-platform/admin/using-word-templates-dynamics-365). 

3. In the dialog box that appears, save or download the PDF.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![A quote form showing the Create PDF button on the command bar](../sales-enterprise/media/save-or-download-pdf-document.png "A quote form showing the Create PDF button on the command bar")
    
    - If you select **Save**, the PDF file is stored in the default SharePoint site if SharePoint is configured and enabled for the Quote entity. If SharePoint isn't configured, the **Save** option saves the PDF as a Notes attachment to the Quote record in Dynamics 365 Sales. 
    - If you select the **Download** option, the PDF is downloaded to your local drive. After it's downloaded, you can add this file to a note, send it as an attachment in an email, or upload it to SharePoint.

You can also generate a PDF file and directly email it to a customer.

1. Open an entity record. For example, open a quote record.

2. On the command bar, select **Email as PDF** and then select a document template.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![A quote form showing the Email as PDF button on the command bar](media/email-as-pdf-sales-professional.png "A quote form showing the Email as PDF button on the command bar")
    
    An email form opens. 
    
    The following information is automatically populated.

    |Field             |    Populated with                                 |
    |------------------|-------------------------------------------------| 
    |**To**                |    Potential customer, if applicable                |
    |**From**                 |  Current user                                   |
    |**Attachments**       |    The generated PDF, added as an attachment         |
    |**Regarding**           |  Record from which the email was triggered| 
    |**Subject**             |  Title of the record                                    |

3. Verify and change any details in the email form, and then select **Send**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The time taken to generate the PDF file and download or send the email depends on the size of the file. You'll see optimum performance when the file size is less than 2 MB. Larger files can require considerably more response time.

## FAQ

**Question:** What happens if more than one SharePoint document location is associated with a record? <br>
**Answer:** Regardless of the number of SharePoint document locations that exist for a record, the generated PDF file is always saved to the default location: \[<record_name>_<record_id>].<br>

**Question:** Can I specify a different name for the PDF file before generating it?<br>
**Answer:** Yes. You can specify a different file name if you are not using Dynamics 365 for phones on a mobile device.<br>

**Question:** Can I choose to save the PDF file to the Sales app as notes or to SharePoint? <br>
**Answer:** No. If SharePoint is enabled for the entity for which you're generating a PDF, the PDF file will be saved to the SharePoint location by default.  <br>

**Question:** Is the PDF generation capability available on all entities? <br>

# Add or remove sample data in Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional

Sample data gives you something to experiment with as you learn Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional, and helps you see how data is organized in the system. At some point, you’ll probably want to remove the sample data.

Or, if sample data isn’t installed on your system, you may want to add it for training purposes. Later, when you’re ready, you can remove it.

>   [!Important]

>   Use sample data to learn and play around with system features. However, to
>   avoid unwanted results, don’t associate it with any data you actually need.

1.  Make sure you have the System Administrator security
    role in Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional.

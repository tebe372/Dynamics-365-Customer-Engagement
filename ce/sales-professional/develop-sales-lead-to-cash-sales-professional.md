# Develop sales from lead to cash in Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional

The sales process in Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional helps you close more deals and achieve higher customer satisfaction. You can achieve more consistent
sales interactions by following the sales process as it takes you through each stage, from creating a lead to closing the opportunity and recording the sale.
You also end up with a more complete history that you can refer to later, if you plan to work with your customer again in the future, or if your customer needs
support.

Your sales process begins with a leadâ€”someone who is interested in the products or services you provide. Your leads might be automatically generated by , or
they might come from other sources, such as website opt-in pages, email queries, or business cards you gather at trade shows.

# Overview of Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

Welcome to Dynamics 365 Sales Professional. If you don't need a full-fledged enterprise app for your organization, the new Dynamics 365 Sales Professional app is for you.

This offering, available online only and built on the new Unified Interface framework, contains a targeted set of sales capabilities to get your organization up and running quickly.

It is designed from the ground up with accessibility in mind, and uses responsive web design principles to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience for any screen size, device, or orientation. For example, subgrids morph into lists for smaller screen sizes.

Dynamics 365 Sales Professional comes with a **Get Started** page that shows you the core things you need to set up to have your users get started, such as connecting email, sharing documents, and importing data.

Plus, sellers will find a streamlined lead-to-cash process, easier account, contact, and opportunity management, and dashboards that make it faster to
visualize useful information at a glance.

## Get productive quickly

The app is designed to make getting up to speed simple and painless, whether you’re handling your day-to-day sales transactions or setting up the app for
your team. 

What’s the fastest way to get productive? 

Here are a couple options:

-   **Dive in and try out the sample data.** If you learn best through hands-on exploration, the app comes with sample data to help you see how
    data is presented and organized, and to give you something to experiment with as you get oriented.

    Start exploring, and play around with the sample data until you’re ready to work with your real customer data.

-   **Do a quick read that covers the basics.** The user guide and learning modules contain all the essentials you need to know to navigate the app,
    find and enter customer data, glean actionable insights from interactive dashboards, and more. And it’s short. (We know you’re busy.)

No matter how you decide to get started, soon you’ll be up and running—working your deals and building profitable relationships along the way, as you turn your
customers into lifelong fans of your products.

Ready to get started? Here are the feature highlights.

    you’re working on, and activate it. Use the same quote to quickly generate an invoice and mark the deal as won. You can also email the quotes and
    invoices to your customer in just one click.

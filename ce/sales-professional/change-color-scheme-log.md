Change the color scheme or logo for your organization
=====================================================

Change the color scheme of the user interface based on your preference or create
your own branding by changing the color scheme or logo in Dynamics 365 for Sales
Professional. You can create a custom look and feel (a theme), for your Sales
app and the Dynamics 365 for phones app by creating new themes with colors and
visual elements.

The theme colors are applied globally throughout the application. For example,
you can enhance the following visual elements in the UI:

-   Change product logos

-   Change Nav Bar Color, Main Color, Accent Color

-   Nav Bar color defines the background color for the navigation bar

-   Main Color defines the color for command bar, buttons, and tabs

-   Accent Color defines the color for process bar

Apply a new theme
-----------------

The Sales app comes with three default themes that you can use. You can choose
one of these default themes and apply, or pick any other custom theme that you
may have created.

To apply a theme, select the theme in the **Select Theme** drop-down list, and
select **Save and Apply Theme**.

The theme that you are currently using is shown with the text “currently
applied”.

Standard and Advanced Settings overview
=======================================

Are you the person responsible for getting your sales team onboard?

Here’s some good news.

Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional comes with a simple and straightforward
setup experience, so anybody can put things together and get their team rolling
quickly.

Welcome page
------------

The Welcome page has resources to get you started—you’ll see links to videos and
documentation. Go to **Standard settings** page to start setting up the basic
things or go directly to the app and start working.

Standard settings
-----------------

The Standard settings page provides an intuitive experience of setting up the
most important things with fewer clicks. With just one click, Exchange and
SharePoint are automatically configured for you, and your users are ready to
send out emails or share documents on SharePoint. The quick setup also lets you
quickly import data, so your users have it ready in the app to start their work.

Advanced settings
-----------------

When you want to do more advanced-level settings to configure the app, or
customize it to meet your organization’s requirements, **Advanced settings** is
your one-stop shop. You can find the settings for branding and theming, teams,
maintaining templates all under one roof. The configurations are simple—you’ll
be done with these in just fewer clicks.

Customize
---------

If the Sales app does not entirely fit your business requirement, use the
drag-and-drop designers to quickly make changes to the app to reflect the
specific information that your company needs. For example, change the pipeline
phases to match your organization’s business flows or add new fields to capture
data relevant to your business—all of this without writing a single line of
code.

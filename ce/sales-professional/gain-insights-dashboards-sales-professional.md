# Gain insights with dashboards in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

Dashboards in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional provide an overview of
business data—actionable information that’s viewable across the organization. Use dashboards to see important data at a glance.

Dashboards use views, lists, and charts to bring data that is meaningful to you to one place.

## Where to find dashboards

To go to dashboards, in the site map, select **Dashboards**.

## Dashboards in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

Sales Professional comes with the following prebuilt dashboards that you can use to quickly get insights on your sales data and team performance.

### Sales Manager Summary dashboard

This dashboard shows data that helps sales managers get important insights on how their sales team is performing. The sales pipeline shows open opportunities in different stages. 

The “deal won versus deal lost” chart shows the number of opportunities won or lost by an owner. The dashboard also includes charts that show important financial data such as estimated versus actual revenue by month.

### Sales Professional Summary dashboard

This dashboard shows daily work-related sales numbers such as the activities you’re working on, your sales pipeline, or your open opportunities and leads.

### Sales dashboard

Sales dashboard is an interactive dashboard. It helps you review information from various entities and act on it. You can use visual and global filters in the dashboard to quickly get to what's most important.

The Sales dashboard is a multi-stream dashboard where each stream shows an entity view.

#### Take a quick action on a record in the stream

You can take entity-specific actions right from the stream. For example, in the Open Leads stream, select the More options icon to open the More options menu. From this menu, you can quickly qualify a lead or assign it to other users.

> ![Take quick action on records from the dashboard](media/quick-action-dashboard.png "Take quick action on records from the dashboard")

#### Perform bulk actions

You can select multiple records and take action on them at once. Select the **Select multiple records to perform bulk actions** icon ![Select multiple records for bulk action](media/select-multiple-records-bulk-action.png "Select multiple records for bulk action")  and select multiple records by selecting the check box. Then, select the **More Commands** icon (**...**) to see the actions that can be performed on the selected records.

#### Visual filters in the Sales dashboard 

In the multi-stream dashboard, when you select **Show Visual Filter**, you see a row of visual filters at the top with the data streams below. 

Visual filters provide a visual snapshot of key metrics, such as opportunities by account or rating or opportunities in different stages of a sales pipeline. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Visual filters in interactive dashboard](media/visual-filters-interactive-dashboard.png "Visual filters in interactive dashboard")
 
Visual filters help in displaying information that interests you most. For example, if you select the Hot area of the **Opportunities by Rating** chart, the dashboard and the streams are refreshed to show only the opportunities with Hot rating.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Hot area selected in the Opportunities by rating chart](media/opportunities-by-rating-chart.png "Hot area selected in the Opportunities by rating chart")
 
You’ll see the filter applied at the top of the charts. 
 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Chart with filters applied](media/chart-with-visual-filters-applied.png "Chart with filters applied")

To remove a specific filter, select the **Close** icon for the applied filter:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Remove visual filters](media/remove-visual-filters.png "Remove visual filters")
 
To remove all the applied filters, select **Clear All**.

#### Global filters in the Sales dashboard

To drill down further into your data, use the Global filter. 
For example, you can apply the Global filter to see only those opportunities that have their estimated close date set to a date in this week. 

To apply a global filter, on the command bar, select **Show Global Filter**. 

![Global filters in an interactive dashboard](media/global-filters-interactive-dashboard.png "Global filters in an interactive dashboard")
 
After you choose a filter, select the **Apply filter** icon ![Apply filter icon](media/apply-filter-icon.png "Image hover text"). You can also save this filter for future by selecting the **Save as a reusable filter** icon  ![Save as a reusable filter icon](media/save-as-reusable-filter.png "Save as a reusable filter icon").

#### Set the sort order
You can easily switch the sort order in the stream by selecting the field on which you want the data to be sorted.

## Open a different dashboard

You can use the view selector to select a dashboard of your choice. Select the dashboard name, and from the drop-down list, select the dashboard you want to open.

## Set a dashboard as the default

To see a specific dashboard every time you sign in to Dynamics 365 Sales Professional, set it as the default. To do this, open the dashboard, and on the command bar, select **Set as Default**.

## Entity dashboards

Other than the dashboards described earlier, there are dashboards specific to entities. These are available for account, contact, lead, opportunity, quote, and invoice entities. Remember, an entity is the same as a record type.

To see an entity dashboard, go to the list of records for the entity, and then on the command bar, select **Open Dashboards**.

For example, in the list of opportunities, when you select **Open Dashboard**, the following dashboard, specific to the opportunity entity, is displayed.

![Entity dashboard for opportunity](media/opportunity-entity-dashboard.png "Entity dashboard for opportunity")

You can use the global or visual filters to see only the data that is important to you.

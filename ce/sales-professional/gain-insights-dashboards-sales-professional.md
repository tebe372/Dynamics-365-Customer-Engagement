# Gain insights with dashboards in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

Dashboards in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional provide an overview of
business data—actionable information that’s viewable across the organization. Use dashboards to see important data at a glance.

Dashboards use views, lists, and charts to bring data that is meaningful to you to one place.

## Where to find dashboards

To go to dashboards, in the site map, select **Dashboards**.

## Dashboards in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

Sales Professional comes with the following prebuilt dashboards that you can use to quickly get insights on your sales data and team performance.

### Sales Manager Summary dashboard

This dashboard shows data that helps sales managers get important insights on how their sales team is performing. The sales pipeline shows open opportunities in different stages. 

The “deal won versus deal lost” chart shows the number of opportunities won or lost by an owner. The dashboard also includes charts that show important financial data such as estimated versus actual revenue by month.

### Sales Professional Summary dashboard

This dashboard shows daily work-related sales numbers such as the activities you’re working on, your sales pipeline, or your open opportunities and leads.

## Set a dashboard as the default

To see a specific dashboard every time you sign in to Dynamics 365 Sales Professional, set it as the default. To do this, open the dashboard, and on the command bar, select **Set as Default**.

## Entity dashboards

Other than the dashboards described earlier, there are dashboards specific to entities. These are available for account, contact, lead, opportunity, quote, and invoice entities. Remember, an entity is the same as a record type.

To see an entity dashboard, go to the list of records for the entity, and then on the command bar, select **Open Dashboards**.

For example, in the list of opportunities, when you select **Open Dashboard**, the following dashboard, specific to the opportunity entity, is displayed.

You can use the global or visual filters to see only the data that is important to you.

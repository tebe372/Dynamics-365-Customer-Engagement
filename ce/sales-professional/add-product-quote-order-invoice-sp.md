# Add products to a quote, order, or invoice (Sales Hub)

You can add products or product bundles to a quote, order, or invoice record. The product can be an existing product in the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] product catalog or an ad hoc product that you add as a write-in product. 

If you’ve created a quote from an opportunity, the products added to the opportunity are automatically added to the quote. You can add more products or remove the existing ones.

The process for adding a product to a quote record is the same as adding a product to an order or an invoice. This topic explains how to add products to a quote record.

1. From the list of quotes, open the quote record you want to add the product to. 

2. On the **Summary** tab, in the **Products** section, select the **More Commands** button ![More Commands button](media/more-commands-button.png "More Commands button"), and then select **Add Product**.

3. In the **Quick Create: Quote Product form**, do the following: 

    1.	In the **Select Product** drop-down list, select whether you want to add an existing product or create a new one:

        - In the **Existing Product** field, select **Lookup** to search for and add a product. Also, select a unit of measurement for the product.

          > [!NOTE]
          > - When a price list is selected for the opportunity, the products listed in the **Existing Product** field are filtered by the price list. This means that only the product associated with the selected price list are shown in this field. 
          > - When a price list isn't selected, the **Existing product** field shows all active products (not filtered by the price list). You can change the view to look for other products by selecting the **Change View** icon. 
          > - By default, the product lookup will show the most recently used products. The most recently used products are not filtered based on the selected price list. 
          > - If a price list is selected, and you select a product that isn’t associated with the price list, you'll see an error. Select a product that's associated with the selected price list.

        - To create a product, select **Write-In**, and then enter the name of the product.

    2.	Fill in details in the **Pricing** section:

        - **Price Overridden**: If you’re adding an existing product from the product catalog, select whether you want to use the default pricing that is listed in the product catalog or override the price. For a write-in product, this field is set to **Override** Price. 

        - **Price Per Unit**: If you’re adding a write-in product, enter the price to be charged per unit for the product.

        - **Quantity**: Enter the quantity of the product or service that will be included. 

        - **Manual Discount**: If you want to offer a discount to the product price, enter it here. 

        - **Tax**. If required, enter the appropriate tax amount. 

4. To save this product, and add more products, select the drop-down arrow besides **Save and Close**, and then select **Save & Create New**.

The **Products** grid shows all the products that are associated with the quote. After you add a product, you can change the unit, price, quantity, and discount of the product inline in the **Products** grid. For a write-in product, you can also change the price of the product in addition to the quantity and discount. 

Here are the actions you can take on the products in the Products grid:

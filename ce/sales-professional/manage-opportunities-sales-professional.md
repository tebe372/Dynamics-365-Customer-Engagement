# Create or edit an opportunity in Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional

In Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional, an opportunity is a potential sale, like a lead, but with an opportunity you can forecast revenue, set a potential close date, and factor in a probability for the sale. You can also track contact information and information about the salesperson working on the opportunity.
You must link a new opportunity to an existing account or contact.

If you’re following the sales process from start to finish, you qualify a lead to turn it into an opportunity.

You can create a new opportunity or convert one from a qualified lead without re-entering the data. When you convert a qualified lead to an opportunity, you can access the lead record, which includes activities, from the corresponding opportunity form. The preferred way is to create an opportunity from a lead.

## Recalculate an opportunity

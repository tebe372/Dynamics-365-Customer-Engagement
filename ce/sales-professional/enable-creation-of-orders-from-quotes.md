# Enable creation of orders from quotes

Quotes have important data about the customers and the products they're interested in. When you enable the **Quote to order** setting, it allows sellers to quickly create an order from a quote so that most of the details in the order are prefilled from the quote.  

1. Make sure you have a Sales Professional Manager or System Administrator role.

2. In the site map, select **Sales Settings**.

3.  Under **Advanced Settings**, select **Quote Settings**.

4.  To enable creation of orders from quotes, set **Enable automatic quote to order generation** to **Enabled**.

6.  Select **Save**.

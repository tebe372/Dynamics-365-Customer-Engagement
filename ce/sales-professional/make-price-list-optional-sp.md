# Allow adding products without associated price list (Sales Professional)

When adding products to opportunities, quotes, orders, or invoices, at times, salespeople need to specify the product prices ad hoc. You can allow salespeople to add products without associating a price list first.

## Make price list optional

1.  In your app, on the nav bar, select the **Settings** icon, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

    The Business Management settings page opens in a new browser tab.

2.  On the nav bar, select **Settings**, and then select **Administration**.

3.  Select **System Settings**.

4.  In the **System Settings dialog** box, on the **Sales** tab, set the **Make price lists optional** field to **Yes**.

You can select the entities on which you want to enable PDF generation.

2.	Under **Advanced settings**, select **PDF generation**.

3.	To enable or disable PDF generation, on the **Generate PDF file** page, under **Select whether PDF files can be created, saved, and emailed based on Dynamics 365 Sales entity records**, set the entity toggle to **Enabled** or **Disabled**. For example, if you want to enable PDF generation on **Opportunity** records, set the Opportunity toggle to **Enabled**.

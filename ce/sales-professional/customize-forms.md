Customize forms (Sales Professional)
====================================

In Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional, forms provide the user interface that
people use to interact with the data they need to do their work. It is important
that the forms people use are designed to allow them to find or enter the
information they need quickly. You can use the form designer to customize the
forms included with Dynamics 365 for Sales Professional to meet the specific
needs of your organization.

>   [!IMPORTANT]

>   Only customizations done within the app are supported. You should not try to
>   customize your forms outside of the app itself.

How do forms relate to entities?
--------------------------------

A form is a set of data-entry fields that matches the items your organization
tracks for a specific entity. For example, your organization might have fields
that track a customerâ€™s previous orders and specific requested reorder dates.

When you publish a customized form, you are publishing an updated version of the
entity associated with the form.

What forms can you customize?
-----------------------------

You can customize any of the following forms in Dynamics 365 for Sales

-   Account

-   Invoice

-   Lead

-   Opportunity

-   Quote

To access the forms:

What types of customizations can you do?
----------------------------------------

field customization. You can't customize controls (timeline or Bing maps, for
example) or change the layout of a form by adding or removing new form sections
or tabs or rearranging sections and tabs. For more information on creating
forms, see [Create and design
forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/create-design-forms).

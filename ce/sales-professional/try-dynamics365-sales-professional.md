# Sign up for a free trial of Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

With Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Professional, you can streamline your sales processes, shorten sales cycles, and integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Office 365 and LinkedIn, helping you to close deals and achieve your quota faster.

Sales Professional trials are fully functional, but limited to 30 days. Each Sales Professional trial comes preinstalled on a dedicated trial instance. You can't install a Sales Professional trial on an existing instance.

Dynamics 365 Sales Professional is a cloud-based application that runs on a Microsoft 365 tenant*. Your tenant hosts your cloud applications (including Office 365 and Dynamics 365), provides user and license management, and more. The procedure for setting up your trial depends on whether you already have a *managed* tenant (a tenant where Azure Active Directory is available), an unmanaged tenant, or no tenant at all.

- \*If you already have a managed tenant, you can sign up for the Dynamics Sales Professional trial by following the instructions in the section [Installation steps when you belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

- If you don’t have a Microsoft 365 tenant, you can sign up for the Dynamics Sales Professional trial by following the instructions in the section [Installation steps when you don't belong to an existing tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-dont-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

-  *If you already have an unmanaged tenant and prefer to continue using it*, then you must first convert it to a managed tenant. For more information, see [Take over an unmanaged directory as administrator in Azure Active Directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=866761). Then continue with the steps in the section [Installation steps when you belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

## Installation steps when you belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant

1.  Go to the [Dynamics 365 Sales Professional](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/professional/) marketing page.

2.  To sign up for a 30-day free trial, select **Free trial**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Sign up using your work email address](media/sign-up.png "Sign up using your work email address")

4.  Based on the email address, if you are found to belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant, you’ll be asked to read and agree to the terms and conditions and privacy policy.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Agree to terms and conditions and select Start](media/accept-terms-and-start.png "Agree to terms and conditions and select Start")

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you don't belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant, follow the steps outlined in [Installation steps when you don't belong to an existing tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-dont-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

5.  Select **Start**.

6.  On the **Permissions requested** page, give consent to allow the app the permissions it requires on your tenant. Select **Accept**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Give app the required permissions](media/permissions-requested-page.png "Give app the required permissions")

7.  While the app is being set up for you, you’ll see the features and capabilities that the app offers:

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Sales Professional capabilities](media/sales-professional-capabilities.png "Sales Professional capabilities")

8.  When the app is ready, you’ll see the message “Your trial is ready! We hope you enjoy using Sales Professional”. Select **Let’s go**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screen showing that the trial is ready](media/trial-ready.png "Screen showing that the trial is ready")

    If you don’t select **Let’s go**, you’ll be redirected to the Dynamics 365 apps page after a few seconds, from where you can launch the Sales Professional app.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Launch Sales Professional from the apps page](media/apps-page-launch-sales-professional.png "Launch Sales Professional from the apps page")

    On launching the app, you'll see an interactive dashboard that provides a view of the Sales pipeline, Leads, Opportunities, Activities, and Sales Leaderboard based on preloaded sample data. To see the visual filters as illustrated below, select **Show Visual Filter** in the dashboard command ribbon.

## Installation steps when you don't belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant 

1.  Go to the [Dynamics 365 Sales Professional](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/professional/) marketing page.

2.  To sign up for a 30-day free trial, select **Free trial**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Sign up using your work email address](media/sign-up.png "Sign up using your work email address")

    Because your email address doesn't belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant, you can sign up for a Sales Professional trial by creating a new managed tenant for your organization and becoming an administrator of the tenant.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Save your sign-in information](media/admin-trial-setup-save-details.png "Save your sign-in information")

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Install Dynamics 365 Sales Professional solution](media/dynamics365-admin-center-sales-pro-install.png "Install Dynamics 365 Sales Professional solution")

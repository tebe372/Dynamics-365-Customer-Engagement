# Sign up for a free trial of Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

With Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Professional, you can streamline your sales processes, shorten sales cycles, and integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Office 365 and LinkedIn, helping you to close deals and achieve your quota faster.

Sales Professional trials are fully functional, but limited to 30 days. Each Sales Professional trial comes preinstalled on a dedicated trial instance. You can't install a Sales Professional trial on an existing instance.

Dynamics 365 Sales Professional is a cloud-based application that runs on a Microsoft 365 tenant*. Your tenant hosts your cloud applications (including Office 365 and Dynamics 365), provides user and license management, and more. The procedure for setting up your trial depends on whether you already have a *managed* tenant (a tenant where Azure Active Directory is available), an unmanaged tenant, or no tenant at all.

- If you already have a managed tenant, you can sign up for the Dynamics 365 Sales Professional trial by following the instructions in the section [Installation steps when you belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

- If you don’t have a Microsoft 365 tenant, you can sign up for the Dynamics 365 Sales Professional trial by following the instructions in the section [Installation steps when you don't belong to an existing tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-dont-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

-  If you already have an unmanaged tenant and prefer to continue using it, then you must first convert it to a managed tenant. For more information, see [Take over an unmanaged directory as administrator in Azure Active Directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=866761). Then continue with the steps in the section [Installation steps when you belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

## Installation steps when you belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant

1.  Open the [Dynamics 365 Sales Professional trial sign-up page](https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?sku=9c7bff7a-3715-4da7-88d3-07f57f8d0fb6&RU=https://salesprotrial.dynamics.microsoft.com).

2.  In the **Step up to Sales Professional** page, enter your work email address and then select **Sign up**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Sign up using your work email address](media/sign-up.png "Sign up using your work email address")

3.  Based on the email address, if you are found to belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant, you’ll be asked to sign in using your email address. Select **Sign in**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Sign in using your email address](media/trial-sign-in.png "Sign in using your email address")

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you don't belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant, follow the steps outlined in [Installation steps when you don't belong to an existing tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-dont-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Sales Professional capabilities](media/sales-professional-capabilities.png "Sales Professional capabilities")

7.  When the app is ready, you’ll see the message “Your trial is ready! We hope you enjoy using Sales Professional”. Select **Let’s go**.

    > ![Screen showing that the trial is ready](media/trial-ready.png "Screen showing that the trial is ready")

    You’ll be redirected to the Sales Professional app page.

## Installation steps when you don't belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant 

1.  Open the [Dynamics 365 Sales Professional trial sign-up page](https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?sku=9c7bff7a-3715-4da7-88d3-07f57f8d0fb6&RU=https://salesprotrial.dynamics.microsoft.com).

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Sign up using your work email address](media/sign-up.png "Sign up using your work email address")

    Because your email address doesn't belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant, you can sign up for a Sales Professional trial by creating a new managed tenant for your organization and becoming an administrator of the tenant.

# Sign up for free trial of Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

With Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Professional, you can streamline your sales processes, shorten sales cycles and integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Office 365 and LinkedIn, so you can - close deals and achieve your quota faster.

Sales Professional trials are fully functional, but limited to 30 days. Each Sales Professional trial comes pre-installed on a dedicated trial instance. You can't install a Sales Professional trial on an existing instance.

Dynamics 365 Sales Professional is a cloud-based application that runs on a Microsoft 365 tenant*. Your tenant hosts your cloud applications (including Office 365 and Dynamics 365), provides user and license management, and much more. The procedure for setting up your trial depends on whether you already have a *managed* tenant (which is a tenant where Azure Active Directory (Azure
AD) is available), an unmanaged tenant, or no tenant at all.

-   *If you already have a managed tenant, you can sign up for the Dynamics Sales Professional trial by following the instructions in the section [Installation steps when you belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

- If you don’t have a Microsoft 365 tenant, you can sign up for the Dynamics Sales Professional trial by following the instructions in the section [Installation steps when you don't belong to an existing tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-dont-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

-   *If you already have an unmanaged tenant and prefer to continue using it*, then you must first convert it to a managed. For more information, see [Take over an unmanaged directory as administrator in Azure Active Directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=866761). Then continue with the steps in the section [Installation steps when you belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant](#installation-steps-when-you-belong-to-an-existing-microsoft-365-tenant).

## Installation steps when you belong to an existing Microsoft 365 tenant

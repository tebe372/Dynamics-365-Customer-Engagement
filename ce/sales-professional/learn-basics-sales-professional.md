## Find your way around the app

The Sales Professional app is designed so that you can access the tools and customer data you need quickly when you need them.

### Navigation bar at the top

The navigation bar (or nav bar) at the top of every screen includes buttons for common tasks like searching for customer data or entering records. The nav bar also includes
access to tools that help you manage your deals, such as a guided task flow that walks you through common sales tasks.

## Understand the data in the app

Every day, you’ll work with different customer records and record types as you move customers through your business processes, collecting the data you need to
fill in the fields for their records—and ultimately to win their business.

-   What’s a record? In Dynamics 365, a **record** is a complete unit of information, such as all the information about a single contact. You can think of it as a row in a table. For example, each time you add a new account to the app, you’re creating a new record in the Sales Professional app.

-   What’s a record type? Each record you add to the system belongs to a certain **record type**, such as an account, contact, lead, or opportunity.

## Quick Create—enter new records fast

The Quick Create command makes it fast and easy to enter almost any type of information into the system. The command is on the nav bar, so it’s available whenever you need to enter new info into the system.

With Quick Create, you need to complete only a few fields. Later, when you have more time or more information, you can fill in more details.

1.  On the nav bar, select **New** ![Icon for Quick Create](media/quick-create-icon.png "Icon for Quick Create"), and then select the item you want.

2.  Fill in the fields, and then select **Save**.


## Business processes in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

Business processes help everyone follow best practices, even when handling situations that don’t occur very often. You complete a step by entering data or
marking the step completed in the process bar at the top of the screen. When all the steps are done, you can move on to the next stage.

The following ready-to-use business processes are available that you can use as you move your leads through a sales process:

  -   Lead to invoice. This business process flow is available for:
      -   All leads.
      -   Opportunities created from leads
  -   Opportunity sales process. This business process flow is available for:
      -   All directly created opportunities (not originating from lead) forms

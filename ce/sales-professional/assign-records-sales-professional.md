If you would like another person in your organization to handle an account or contact for you, you can assign the record to that person.

You can also assign a record to a team, or to yourself.

1.  In the site map, select **Accounts** or **Contacts**.

2.  In the list of records, select the record that you want.

3.  On the command bar, select **Assign**.

4.  In the **Assign** dialog box, select the **Assign to** box to switch between **Me** and **User or Team**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

5.  If you have chosen to assign to **User or Team**, then in the **User or team** field, select the **Lookup** icon to select a user or a team.

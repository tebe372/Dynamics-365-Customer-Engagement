# Sales transactions in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

In Dynamics 365 Sales Professional, a sale typically starts with a draft quote. When the quote is ready, it is activated and sent to the customer for revisions before it is accepted. Then, when youâ€™re shipping the products offered in the quote, an invoice is generated from the quote.

Quotes and invoices in the Sales app are the same item in different states of transition. You can use tools and templates to create and print quotes and invoices.

You can start a sales transaction, such as a quote or invoice, from within the opportunity record. The advantage of starting sales transactions in this manner is that much of the information is automatically entered based on the opportunity data. You can also view any sales transaction records from within the opportunity record to track the overall sales process and expected revenue.

## Understanding quote stages

When you create a new quote, it is automatically set to Draft, and the revision ID is set to 0.

Before a quote is sent to a customer, it must be set to Active. Activating a quote makes it read-only so your versions matches the customer's version. If you revise it, the revision ID will increase by one.

When you close a quote, you have three choices: Lost, Canceled, or Revised. If you revise it, a new quote is created, set to Draft status, and you can start over. If you do not revise it, the quote is closed.

## Differences between Current Pricing and Prices Locked in invoices

Dynamics 365 Sales has two kinds of pricing behavior on invoices: **Use Current Pricing** and **Prices Locked**.

The **Use Current Pricing** price comes directly from the product catalog. If you change the price of a product there, then it changes in all open invoices that include the product.

**Prices Locked** locks the price for a product in an open invoice. Even if the price changes in the product catalog, that invoice remains at the agreed price.

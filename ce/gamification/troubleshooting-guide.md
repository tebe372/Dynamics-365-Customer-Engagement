# Troubleshooting guide

## I have installed Gamification from AppSource and get the error "Cannot create organization" while activating.

You should be able to install and activate Gamification if the pre-requisites in [Activate Gamification in Dynamics 365](manage-gamification-in-dynamics-365-online.md#activate-gamification-in-dynamics-365) are met. If you are still facing an issue, please try the following options: 

- The signed in user has a non-empty first name, last name and email address in Office 365. For more information, see [Manage Office 365 User Information](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/change-a-user-name-and-email-address).

- The signed in user has a Global admin role in Office 365. For more information, see [Manage O365 User Roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles).

- The signed in user has a System Administrator role in Dynamics 365. For more information, see [Manage User Roles in Dynamics 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user)

- The signed in user has Read-Write license assigned in Dynamics 365. For more information, see [Manage User License in Dynamics 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#create-a-read-write-user-account).

If you continue to face issues while activating Gamification, raise a Support request from the Dynamics 365 Admin Center and provide the error details and the timestamp of the error occurrence.

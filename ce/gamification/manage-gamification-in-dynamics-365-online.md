# Install and configure the Gamification solution

The [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] capabilities are a solution for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], hosted on [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_appsource](../includes/pn-microsoft-appsource.md)], that you need to install before you can start using the capabilities to manage your [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] games, KPIs, and players.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] requires at least [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online.md)].  
  
- Users must have a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] license assigned to access the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] service.  
  
- Users must have an up-to-date browser. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Browser requirements to enable a seamless experience in Gamification](browser-system-requirements.md)  

## Install Dynamics 365 - Gamification  

[!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] are a solution for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] that you install from [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830919).  

### Limitations

We recommend to adhere to the following limits when working with [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] to avoid synchronization and performance issues: 
- Up to **15** concurrent games.
- Up to **500** users per game.
- Up to **10** fixed teams per game.
- Up to **4000** users across all connected organizations.
  
> [!NOTE]
> To avoid timeout issues when syncing the data of more than 2000 users, you need to change the number of users sent per page in the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] settings.    
> In Dynamics 365, select **Advanced Find**. Look for **Gamification Settings** and select **Results**. Open the **Gamification Settings** and lower the value for **Users sent per page**.

### Install the solution from AppSource  
  
1. Go to the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Gamification app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830919) on Microsoft AppSource.
  
2. Sign in to your [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] system admin account, if you aren't already signed in.  
  
3. Select **Get it now** to start installing the solution. 

4. In the **One more thing...** pop-up window, select **Continue**.

    You'll be redirected to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

5. In the **Install Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Gamification** panel, select the environment in which you want to install this app, select both check boxes, and then select **Install**.

   You'll be redirected to the **Dynamics 365 apps** page.

6. Find the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Gamification** app, and check the status of it. If the status says **Installing**, wait until the status is changed to **Installed**.


### Sign in to Dynamics 365 - Gamification

1. Go to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

2. Enter your Dynamics 365 instance credentials, and sign in.

3. In the left pane, select **Environments**.

4. On the **Environments** page, select your environment.

5. On the toolbar at the top of the page, select **Open environment**.

6. From the list of apps, select **Gamification**.


## Game Manager security role

 When you install [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)], a security role called **Game Manager** is created in Dynamics 365. System admins can assign this security role to users who the admins want to enable to create KPIs.  

 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Available security roles in Gamification](understand-security-roles.md)  
 More information about security roles and privileges: [TechNet: Security roles and privileges](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn531090.aspx)  
More information about KPIs in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)]: [Configure KPIs for Gamification in Dynamics 365 apps](configure-kpis.md) 
  
## Activate Gamification in Dynamics 365

Before you can sync [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] with Dynamics 365, a user with the following prerequisites needs to complete the setup process to obtain the security key.  

- The user profile in Office 365 has a non-empty first name, last name, email address 
- The user has a global admin role in Office 365 
- The user has a system administrator security role with an [access mode of Read-Write](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#create-a-read-write-user-account).


> [!TIP]
> Starting with Gamification solution update 17.10, you can connect multiple organizations (business units) of the same Office 365 tenant to a shared Gamification web portal. Repeat the installation and activation for every organization you want to connect to your shared Gamification portal. Users with the Game Manager security role in Organization A can create games for Organization A in Gamification. If they are regular users in Organization B, they can participate as players or fans in games in Organization B. [Learn how to set up and run games.](run-games.md)

   Additionally, the system creates a set of default KPIs in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] so you can quickly get started with the first game in [!INCLUDE[cc_gamification_portal](../includes/cc-gamification-portal.md)].

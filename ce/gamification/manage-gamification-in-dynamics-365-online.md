# Install and configure the Gamification solution

The [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] capabilities are a solution for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], hosted on [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_appsource](../includes/pn-microsoft-appsource.md)], that you need to install before you can start using the capabilities to manage your [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] games, KPIs, and players.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] requires at least [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online.md)].  
  
- Users must have a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] license assigned to access the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] service.  
  
- Users must have an up-to-date browser. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Browser requirements to enable a seamless experience in Gamification](browser-system-requirements.md)  

## Install Dynamics 365 - Gamification  

[!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] are a solution for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] that you install from [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830919).  

### Limitations

We recommend to adhere to the following limits when working with [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] to avoid synchronization and performance issues: 
- Up to **15** concurrent games.
- Up to **500** users per game.
- Up to **10** fixed teams per game.
- Up to **4000** users across all connected organizations.
  
> [!NOTE]
> To avoid timeout issues when syncing the data of more than 2000 users, you need to change the number of users sent per page in the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] settings.    
> In Dynamics 365, select **Advanced Find**. Look for **Gamification Settings** and select **Results**. Open the **Gamification Settings** and lower the value for **Users sent per page**.

### Install the solution from AppSource  
  
1. In [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830919), select **[!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)]**.  
  
2. Sign in to your [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] system admin account, if you aren't already signed in.  
  
3. Click **Get** to start installing the solution.  
   If you have more than one Dynamics 365 organization, select the organization you want to install this solution to.
  
4. Review and accept the disclaimer and the terms of service.  
  
   It might take a few minutes for the solution to be installed.  
  
## Game Manager security role

 When you install [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)], a security role called **Game Manager** is created in Dynamics 365. System admins can assign this security role to users who the admins want to enable to create KPIs.  

 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Available security roles in Gamification](understand-security-roles.md)  
 More information about security roles and privileges: [TechNet: Security roles and privileges](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn531090.aspx)  
More information about KPIs in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)]: [Configure KPIs for Gamification in Dynamics 365 apps](configure-kpis.md) 
  
## Activate Gamification in Dynamics 365

Before you can sync [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] with Dynamics 365, a user with the following prerequisites needs to complete the setup process to obtain the security key.  

- The user profile in Office 365 has a non-empty first name, last name, email address 
- The user has a global admin role in Office 365 
- The user has a system administrator security role with an [access mode of Read-Write](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#create-a-read-write-user-account).


> [!TIP]
> Starting with Gamification solution update 17.10, you can connect multiple organizations (business units) of the same Office 365 tenant to a shared Gamification web portal. Repeat the installation and activation for every organization you want to connect to your shared Gamification portal. Users with the Game Manager security role in Organization A can create games for Organization A in Gamification. If they are regular users in Organization B, they can participate as players or fans in games in Organization B. [Learn how to set up and run games.](run-games.md)

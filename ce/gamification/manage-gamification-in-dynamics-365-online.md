# Install and configure the Gamification solution

[!INCLUDE[cc-gamification-deprecation-notice](../includes/cc-gamification-deprecation-notice.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] capabilities are a solution for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], hosted on [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_appsource](../includes/pn-microsoft-appsource.md)], that you need to install before you can start using the capabilities to manage your [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] games, KPIs, and players.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] requires at least [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online.md)].  
  
- Users must have a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] license assigned to access the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] service.  
  
- Users must have an up-to-date browser. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Browser requirements to enable a seamless experience in Gamification](browser-system-requirements.md)  

## Install Dynamics 365 - Gamification  

[!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] are a solution for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] that you install from [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830919).  

### Limitations

We recommend to adhere to the following limits when working with [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] to avoid synchronization and performance issues: 
- Up to **15** concurrent games.
- Up to **500** users per game.
- Up to **10** fixed teams per game.
- Up to **4000** users across all connected organizations.
  
> [!NOTE]
> - To avoid timeout issues when syncing the data of more than 2000 users, you need to change the number of users sent per page in the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] settings.    
> - In Dynamics 365, select **Advanced Find**. Look for **Gamification Settings** and select **Results**. Open the **Gamification Settings** and lower the value for **Users sent per page**.

## Gamification app access security role

When you install [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)], a security role called **Gamification app access** is created in Dynamics 365.

> [!TIP]
> Starting with Gamification solution update 17.10, you can connect multiple organizations (business units) of the same Microsoft 365 tenant to a shared Gamification web portal. Repeat the installation and activation for every organization you want to connect to your shared Gamification portal. Users with the Game Manager security role in Organization A can create games for Organization A in Gamification. If they are regular users in Organization B, they can participate as players or fans in games in Organization B. [Learn how to set up and run games.](run-games.md)

# Browser and system requirements for Gamification

The system and browser requirements for [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] are the same as those for [Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830208). In addition, your browser must be configured as follows:  
  
- **Allow [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](includes/pn-javascript-md.md)] from [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)]**  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](includes/pn-javascript-md.md)] must be enabled for your browser, at least for your [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)] domain. Most browsers enable [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](includes/pn-javascript-md.md)] by default.  
  
- **Allow cookies from [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)]**

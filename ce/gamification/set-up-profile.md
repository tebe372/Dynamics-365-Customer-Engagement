# Set up and edit your Gamification user profile


Your colleagues will surely want to see who they're competing with in the games. Add a profile picture to make sure they recognize you.  

To add your profile picture, sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](includes/pn-gamification-md.md)] (see [Sign in to Gamification](sign-in.md)) and you'll land on the **Smack Talk** discussion board. Click the gear symbol (![Settings button in Gamification](media/settings-symbol-gamification.png "Settings button in Gamification")) to access **My Settings**. Edit your profile picture or other profile information, and then click **Save** or **Update**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For the best results, resize your profile picture to 150 &times; 150 px.  
  
 If you prefer, you can use one of the provided avatars for your profile picture.

# Contact a Commissioner
When you need to get in touch with a Commissioner or want to raise an issue with a game, you can reach out to the Commissioners from within [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](includes/pn-gamification-md.md)].  
  
 To reach out by using the help options the Commissioner has provided, sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_subsequent](includes/pn-gamification-subsequent-md.md)], and then go to **Help** > **Contact Commissioner**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If this link doesn't work for the game you are part of, ask the Commissioner to configure this setting. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Personalize your Gamification game experience](personalize-game-experience.md)

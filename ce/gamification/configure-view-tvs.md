# Configure and view TVs

Display a slide show for daily, weekly, and monthly KPIs on TVs and screens around your office. All other game models can also be displayed on TVs.
To create a Stream TV from multiple active games, see [Stream results from active games](configure-view-tvs.md#stream-results-from-active-games).


## Set up a Stream TV game  

 Create a Stream TV game model if you want to display KPIs on screens around your office.  
  
### Create a Stream TV slide show  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_portal](includes/pn-gamification-portal.md)], go to **Games** > **Game Setup**.  
  
2. Provide a **Name** for the game and select **Stream TV** from the **Game Model** drop-down menu.  
  
3. Set the **Start Date** and **End Date**.  
  
4. Define the KPIs you want to display on screens.  
  
5. Select the players and fans you want to show on the leaderboard.  
  
6. To apply your configuration, click **Save TV** .  
  
   You'll be redirected to the **Add or Edit Stream TV** page to configure how the results are displayed.  
  
7. Provide a **TV Name** and set the values for how to transition in the slide-show.  
  
8. Configure the first slide and set the **Leaderboard** to display the underlying **KPI** and the **Number of Players on Leaderboard**. You can also edit the **Leaderboard Title** and change the theme for the slide.  
  
  
9. Optionally, make this Stream TV accessible from the public internet. A commissioner can allow the creation of public Stream TVs in [!INCLUDE[pn-gamification-shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)] settings. If it's allowed, you can set **Enable Public Stream TV** to **ON**. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Define the posts to show in Stream TV games](personalize-game-experience.md#define-the-posts-to-show-in-stream-tv-games)

13. Copy the URL of the newly opened browser tab and enter in the browser connected to the screen in your office.

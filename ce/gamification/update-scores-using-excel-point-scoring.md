# Update game scores by using Excel point scoring capabilities in Gamification

If you plan to run a game that uses one or more KPIs that can't be tracked by using [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], you can update the scores for those KPIs by using an [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_excel](../includes/pn-microsoft-excel.md)] template.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can update the scores using an [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_excel](../includes/pn-microsoft-excel.md)] template, you need to [select an Excel KPI](run-games.md#select-a-kpi) when creating or editing your game to use that KPI for scoring.
  
## Update scores by using the Excel file
  
1. Go to **Games** > **Games**.  
  
2. Select the **[!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] Point Scoring** ( ![Excel point scoring button in Gamification](media/excel-point-scoring-gamification.png "Excel point scoring button in Gamification")) button.  
  
3. Select the game you want to update the scores from, and then select the game period you want to update.  
  
4. Select **Download [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] template** ![Download Excel template in Gamification](media/download-excel-gamification.png "Download Excel template in Gamification"), and then update the scores in the file.  
  
5. Select **Upload [!INCLUDE[pn_Excel_short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] file** ![Upload Excel file in Gamification](media/upload-excel-gamification.png "Upload Excel file in Gamification") to upload the file, including the manually updated scores.  
  
   The selected KPIs are now updated in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] for the selected game period.

# Understand security roles used in Gamification

Administrators assign licenses to users to grant them permissions for certain applications. [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] users can't be enabled for [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] unless they have a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] license assigned. The first user to have a Game Manager security role assigned by a system admin in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] is required to set up the connection between [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].

[comment]: <> (Check if first Game manager activate flow is still accurate.)

  
## Available security roles

[!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] provides three security roles: 
- **Commissioner**: Administrators of the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] solution and web portal. The user successfully activating Gamification becomes the first Commissioner in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)]. Additionally, all users in[!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] with a **Global Admin** or **Dynamics 365 Service Administrator** become Commissioners in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)].
- **Game Manager**: Game managers create and run games in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)]. To become a game manager, a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] admin has to assign the **Game Manager** security role to these users in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].
- **User**: The default security role for every user of the connected Dynamics 365 (online) organization. Game managers and commissioners can add them to games as players or fans.

 \* Managing [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] is regulated by [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] permissions and requires a Game Manager security role in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  For information about the Game Manager security role in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], see [Configure KPIs for Gamification in Dynamics 365 (online)](configure-kpis.md) and [Install and configure the Gamification solution in Dynamics 365 (online)](manage-gamification-in-dynamics-365-online.md).

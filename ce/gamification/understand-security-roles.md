# Understand security roles used in Gamification

Administrators assign licenses to users to grant them permissions for certain applications. [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] users can't be enabled for [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] unless they have a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] license assigned. The first user to have a KPI Manager security role assigned by a system admin in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] is required to set up the connection between [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. The user successfully activating Gamification becomes the first Commissioner in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)]. Be sure that you don't delete this user before assigning Commissioner permissions to other users.   
  
## Available security roles

The permissions in games are exclusively granted by the security roles in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)]. For a description of the available security roles, review the [Gamification terminology](glossary.md).  

To learn more about the permissions of the available security roles, refer to the following table.

 \* Managing [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] is regulated by [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] permissions and requires a KPI Manager security role in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  For information about the KPI Manager security role in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], see [Configure KPIs for Gamification in Dynamics 365 (online)](configure-kpis.md) and [Install and configure the Gamification solution in Dynamics 365 (online)](manage-gamification-in-dynamics-365-online.md).  
  
 \** Game managers can participate as a fan or a player in a game they don't administer.

Welcome to [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](includes/pn-gamification-md.md)]. Here's a list of features we've added or updated, and a list of issues we've resolved.  

If you are new to [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)], see [Keep your employees engaged and productive by using Gamification](increase-employee-productivity.md).

## Update 2017.05

### New or improved features

The two core components of [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)] are the solution, which is [installed from AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830919) and integrated in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](includes/pn-crm-shortest-md.md)], and [the web portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=830344), where all the fun happens.

#### Solution

- Simplified the steps to activate the [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)] web portal and connect it with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](includes/pn-crm-shortest-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](includes/proc-more-information-md.md)]
[Activate Gamification in Dynamics 365](manage-gamification-in-dynamics-365-online.md#activate-gamification-in-dynamics-365)

- Introduced a KPI type, **User activity tracking**, to award points based on a user's activity in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](includes/pn-crm-shortest-md.md)].

- Introduced **Delta settings**, a scoring condition for KPIs that is based on the difference (the delta) between two attributes.

- Introduced **Scoring behavior**, a setting for configuring the time at which points are assigned for a given KPI. By default, points are always assigned based on the current state of the record. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](includes/proc-more-information-md.md)]

# Gamification terminology

For a quick reference, review these terms used in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](includes/pn-gamification-md.md)].

## Security roles

Security roles are the permissions that individual users have in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)]. Commissioners specify security roles when they configure [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)] or when they create a new game.

[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](includes/proc-more-information-md.md)] [Understand Gamification security roles](understand-security-roles.md)

### Commissioners

A commissioner is considered to be a referee in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)], and is a user with the broadest permissions. Because commissioners have insider knowledge about players and teams, they aren't allowed to participate in any games. [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)] can be configured with more than one commissioner.

### Fans

Fans are employees whose performance isn't measured with game KPIs. For example, a fan might be an executive manager or a team admin.

### Game managers

Game managers run games, keep players and fans engaged, and take care of administrative tasks like weekly email updates (or point scoring, if KPIs are scored manually). For example, this could be a line manager of the player field. Game managers can optionally participate in games they don't administer.

### Players

Players are listed in a game and work toward business goals measured with the KPIs that are used in the game. A user can be a player in one game and a fan in another game. For example, a player might be a sales rep who closes opportunities, a service pro who solves customer issues, or a marketeer who generates leads from running campaigns.

## Fantasy sport

A type of online game where players and fans become fantasy team managers. Team managers assemble a fictitious team of real players who compete against other fictitious teams. Points for the teams are a sum of the points that the individual players score. In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)], points are awarded by achieving KPIs, usually scored directly from [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](includes/pn-crm-online-md.md)].

## Game

Games are set up and run in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)] to gamify KPIs that are tracked elsewhere. Sometimes referred to as a "contest." There are different types of games:  

- **Fantasy teams:** Players can draft their individual fantasy sport team with their own team members. Due to several player features like team drafting and team manager awards, this is by far the most engaging game model offered in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](includes/pn-gamification-shortest-md.md)]. This selection also lets you choose from the available sports themes when you create a game.

- **Fixed teams:** To keep it simple, a game manager can set the teams, such as Office A and Office B. Selecting this game model requires the game manager to specify well-balanced teams to keep players engaged. If a team significantly falls behind due to having all top performers against them, they will likely lose interest and abandon the contest.

- **No teams:** Players compete individually, without drafting teams. It's as simple as that. Head-to-head, winner takes all.

## Gamification (concept)

Gamification as a concept applies gaming elements and principles to non-game contexts to improve user engagement and productivity, or promote activities and processes among colleagues. Gamification strives to leverage people's natural desire for socializing, mastery, competition, achievement, altruism, or closure. Rewards include points, achievements, badges, cash prizes, tangible prizes, or company benefits.

## Stream TV

Stream TV is a way to stream smack talk notifications and leaderboards from active games to an Internet-connected screen or TV in your office.

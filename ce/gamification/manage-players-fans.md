# Import players and fans from Dynamics 365 (online) and manage their security roles

When you set up a new game, you need to define which users will be players and which will be fans in your upcoming [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](../includes/pn-gamification.md)] game. Users from [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] are available automatically in [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)].


**Players** are competing participants in your game who get points for achieving defined KPIs.

**Fans** are people who aren’t players in an active game—for example, executives, managers, or receptionists—who participate in a [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)] game by drafting a team. If your CEO gets involved in the game, drafts a team, and is personally following player stats, that’s quite an incentive for players to do their best!

## Change a user's security role in Dynamics 365 - Gamification

After users are imported, a commissioner can change the security role of the users.

1. In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification_shortest](../includes/pn-gamification-shortest.md)], go to **Users**.

2. On the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Users** page, search for the user whose role you want to change.

3. Select **Change Role** for the selected user, and then choose the new security role.

4. Select **Update Role** to apply your changes.

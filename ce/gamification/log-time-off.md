# Log your time off
If you’re going to be out of the office during any period of the game, for example on vacation, a business trip, or at a conference, make sure to  set or update your time-off schedule. This ensures that other players can't draft you during these periods, and that players who currently have you on their team will be able to choose temporary replacements.  
  
## Set or update your time-off schedule  
 Select each game period where you believe that your absence will impact your performance for that game period. You can only select entire game periods. For example, if you have some time off for an entire game period and one day of the following game period, you may decide to only log time off in the first period.  
  
#### Take time off for a game period  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](includes/pn-gamification-md.md)], go to **My Games** > **Player Profile**.  
  
2.  Click **Add Time Off**.  
  
3.  In the header, select the game and the game period that you want to log time off for from the drop-down list.  
  
4.  To save your changes, click **Submit**.  
  
#### Remove time off from your schedule  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[pn_gamification](includes/pn-gamification-md.md)], go to **My Games** > **Player Profile** > **Add Time Off**.  
  
2.  In the list,  select the game period to remove your time off from.  
  
3.  To indicate you are available again in that game period, click **Remove** ![Remove button in Gamification](media/remove-symbol-gamification.png "Remove button in Gamification").

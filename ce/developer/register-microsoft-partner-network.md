# Step 1: Register for Microsoft Partner Network account

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

App builders must be identifiable to Microsoft. If you are not already a member of the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN), you must become a member by enrolling [here]. Membership to MPN is free.

On registering for MPN membership, your data is securely sent to Microsoft where it's reviewed by a team. If you qualify for the MPN membership, your account is created, and you receive an email with the required information and credentials that you can use later to sign in to the Cloud Partner Portal to submit your app.

The membership request review process might take couple of days so you can proceed to the next steps as you are waiting for the approval and your Cloud Partner Portal credentials to arrive.

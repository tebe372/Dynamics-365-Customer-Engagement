# Get started with Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement Web API (C#)

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

This section shows you how to access the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps Web API using the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Visual_C#](../../includes/pn-ms-visual-csharp.md)] programming language. The first topic, [Simple Web API quick-start sample (C#)](simple-web-api-quick-start-sample-csharp.md), provides the quickest example of how to accomplish this, as all source code is simplified and provided in one file. The rest of this section shows you how to create and configure [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] projects that use the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps Web API to perform common business data operations. You will be shown how to add helper libraries and references to your project to facilitate authentication and communication to your [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps Server.  
  
 After completing this guide, you will have learned enough to explore the many other business operations that are supported by the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps Web API.   You will also have a better understanding about how the [Web API Samples (C#)](web-api-samples-csharp.md) are structured.

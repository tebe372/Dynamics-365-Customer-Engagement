# AsyncOperation (system job) entity

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

A *system job*, also known as an asynchronous operation, is used to define and track the execution of an asynchronous operation, for example an 
asynchronous registered plug-in, workflow, or other background system operation. When dealing with asynchronous plug-ins and workflows, you typically 
donâ€™t create an `asyncoperation` entity record directly. Instead, an `asyncoperation` record is automatically created in the database whenever an 
asynchronous system operation, such as an asynchronous plug-in or a workflow, is going to run. However, you can use the `asyncoperation` entity when you 
develop custom tools to manage or report on asynchronous operations in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement.  
  
 Note that **System Job** is the display name of this entity when you view it in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. When you write code, you use the `asyncoperation` logical name.

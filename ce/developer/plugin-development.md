# Plug-in development

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

A plug-in is custom business logic (code) that you can integrate with [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] apps to modify or augment the standard behavior of the platform. Another way to think about plug-ins is that they are handlers for events fired by [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps. You can subscribe, or register, a plug-in to a known set of events to have your code run when the event occurs.  
  
 For more information about plug-in run-time execution, see [Event Execution Pipeline](event-execution-pipeline.md).

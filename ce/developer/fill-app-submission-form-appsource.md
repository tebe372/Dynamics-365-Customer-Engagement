# Step 1: Fill the app submission form on AppSource

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Get started by filling out an app submission form on AppSource to provide some initial details about your app.

1. Access the app submission form directly by clicking [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=865109). Alternatively, visit [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com), select **List on AppSource** in the top menu of the page. On the page that appears, select **Submit Your App** at the bottom.
2. Provide information about your contact details, company, and app. All the fields marked with asterisk (*) are mandatory.
3. After filling the form, select **Submit**.

The AppSource team will review the information you provided, and reach out to you with details about the next steps via email. You will also receive the credentials to sign in to the [Cloud Partner Portal](next-steps-submit-app-cloud-partner-portal.md), which you will eventually use to submit your actual app for publishing on AppSource. 

You don't have to wait to hear back from the AppSource team. Proceed with steps 2-5 to continue preparing your app for submission while your information is being reviewed by the AppSource team.

# Use the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement Organization service

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Learn about the techniques available to you when developing managed application code that accesses the Organization service using .NET SDK assemblies. Learn how to access the service, retrieve data, and perform the many supported web service operations.

> [!NOTE]
> The general Organization service programming documentation that is relevant to an online or on-premise server is available in the [Common Data Service](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/org-service/overview) documentation set. To learn about accessing the Organization service through application code, start by reading the documentation under Common Data Service, and then if you are targeting an on-premise or IFD deployment, read the additional documentation in [Customer Engagement](/customer-engagement/developer/use-microsoft-dynamics-365-organization-service).

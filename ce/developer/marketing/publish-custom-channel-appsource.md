# Publish custom channel on AppSource

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Pre-release disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Once you have your custom code (plug-in or workflow), tile, and custom entities/forms tested and ready for the custom channel, you can distribute it using Micrsoft AppSource from where users can download and install it in their Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement instance. 

To so so, add all the components for the custom channel in a solution, and then publish it on Microsoft AppSource. For more information, see [Register your app with AppSource](../register-app-appsource.md).

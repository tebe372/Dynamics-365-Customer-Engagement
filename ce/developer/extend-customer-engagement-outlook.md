description: "Dynamics 365 for Outlook lets users interact with data while they’re offline and not connected to a server. Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement includes features that let you extend your solutions to offline scenarios by calling the web services offline from your custom code. In addition, the Sdk assembly provides programmatic support for basic Outlook actions such as synchronization, going offline or online, and Dynamics 365 for Outlook state verification. Offline programming uses the ASP.NET Development Server."

# Extend Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement for Outlook

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamics 365 for Outlook (Outlook client) is deprecated with the [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-9-0-0-online](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)] release and will be removed in a future major release. Dynamics 365 App for Outlook, introduced with Dynamics CRM 2016 (version 8.0), is our most up-to-date offering for pairing Dynamics 365 with Microsoft Outlook.

[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] lets users interact with data while they’re offline and not connected to a server. [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement includes features that let you extend your solutions to offline scenarios by calling the web services offline from your custom code. In addition, the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Outlook.Sdk> assembly provides programmatic support for basic [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Outlook_Short](../includes/pn-ms-outlook-short.md)] actions such as synchronization, going offline or online, and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] state verification. Offline programming uses the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_asp_net_development_server](../includes/pn-ms-asp-net-development-server.md)].  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] includes features that allow administrators to customize and manage filters for their users. Filter templates provide the starting point for entity synchronization on [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]. Filters determine which entity collections are synchronized to [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] and to [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_SQL_Express](../includes/pn-ms-sql-express.md)] for offline-enabled [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] solutions.

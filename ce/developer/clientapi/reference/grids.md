# Grids and subgrids in Customer Engagement (Client API reference)

[!INCLUDE[](../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Grids present data in a tabular format in Customer Engagement. Grids can span the entire form or can be one of the items on a form; the latter are called *subgrids*.

## Types of grids

There are two types of grids in Customer Engagement:
- **Read-only grids**: Display data in a tabular format. To edit the data displayed in a read-only grid, you have to click the record in the grid to open the form, edit the data, and then save.
-  **Editable grids**: In addition to displaying data in a tabular format, provides rich inline editing capabilities on web and mobile clients including the ability to group, sort, and filter data within the same grid so that you do not have to switch records or views. The editable grid is a custom control, and is supported in the main grid and subgrids on a form in the web client and in dashboards and on form grids on the mobile clients. Although the editable grid control provides editing capability, it honors the read-only grid metadata and field-level security settings.

## Getting the grid context

Grid context is the grid or subgrid instance on a form against which you want to run your code. You can use the execution context to get the form context, and then use the form context to get the grid context. For example:

```JavaScript
function doSomething(executionContext) {
    var formContext = executionContext.getFormContext(); // get the form context
    var gridContext = formContext.getControl("<Grid_Name>"); // get the grid context
    gridContext.getEntityName(); // excecute methods using the grid context
    // perform other operations on grids
}
```
## Events

# getEventSource (Client API reference)

[!INCLUDE[](../../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Returns a reference to the object that the event occurred on.

## Syntax

`ExecutionContextObj.getEventSource()`

## Return value

**Type**: Object

**Description**: Returns the object from the **Xrm** object model that is the source of the event, not an HTMLÂ DOM object. For example, in an [OnChange](../events/attribute-onchange.md) event, this method returns the **formContext.data.entity** attribute object that represents the changed attribute.

# Grid OnChange Event (Client API reference)

[!INCLUDE[](../../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The `OnChange` event occurs when a value is changed in a cell in the editable grid and the cell loses focus. This event can also occur when an attribute value is updated using the [setValue](../attributes/setValue.md) method.

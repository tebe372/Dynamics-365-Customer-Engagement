# Grid OnRecordSelect Event (Client API reference)

[!INCLUDE[](../../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The `OnRecordSelect` event occurs when a single row (record) is selected in the editable grid. This event won't occur if a user selects different cells in the same row, or selects multiple rows.

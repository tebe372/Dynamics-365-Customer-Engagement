# Client API grid context

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Grids present data in a tabular format. Grids can span the entire form or can be one of the items on a form; the latter are called **subgrids**.

The Client API grid context object provides reference to a subgrid on a form against which the current code is executed. 

> [!NOTE]
> Getting the context of a grid (spanning the entire form) is only supported in ribbon commands. More information: [Form and grid context in ribbon actions](../customize-dev/pass-dynamics-365-data-page-parameter-ribbon-actions.md#form-and-grid-context-in-ribbon-actions)

Use the [formContext](clientapi-form-context.md) object to get an instance of the form where the code is executed, and then retrieve the subgrid control on the form. For example, when you know the name of a subgrid control (say **Contacts** subgrid in the default account form), you can access it using the following code:

```JavaScript
function doSomething(executionContext) {
   var formContext = executionContext.getFormContext(); // get the form Context
   var gridContext = formContext.getControl("Contacts"); // get the grid context

   // Perform operations on the subgrid
}
```

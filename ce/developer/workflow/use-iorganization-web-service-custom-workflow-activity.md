# Use the IOrganization web service in a custom workflow activity

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

To call [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] Customer Engagement organization web service methods from within a custom workflow activity, you must first obtain a reference to the web service. This is described in the following procedure and sample code.  
  
1.  Get a reference to <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationServiceFactory>.  
  
2.  Use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationServiceFactory>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationServiceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(System.Nullable{System.Guid})> method to create an instance of<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.  
  
3.  Use the<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> instance to call the supported methods.  
  
## Example  

 The following sample shows how to get the<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> from within the `Execute` method of your custom workflow activity.  
  
```csharp  
  
protected override void Execute(CodeActivityContext executionContext)  
{  
   // Get the context service.  
   IWorkflowContext context = executionContext.GetExtension<IWorkflowContext>();  
   IOrganizationServiceFactory serviceFactory = executionContext.GetExtension<IOrganizationServiceFactory>();  
  
   // Use the context service to create an instance of IOrganizationService.  
   IOrganizationService _orgService = serviceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(context.InitiatingUserId);  
  
   // Use the service reference to call web methods.  
   _orgService.Execute(â€¦);  
}  
  
```

# Debug a custom workflow activity

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

To debug a custom workflow activity, copy the .pdb file for the assembly to the `%installdir%\server\bin\assembly` folder. The assembly can be deployed as on-disk or stored in the database. The recommended deployment is in the database, but for debugging you should select on-disk. Next, attach the debugger to the `CrmAsyncService.exe` process. Make sure that you remove the .pdb file when youâ€™ve finished debugging because it uses memory to have it loaded. For detailed information, see [Debug a plug-In](../debug-plugin.md).

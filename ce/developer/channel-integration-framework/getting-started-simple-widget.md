# Getting started with building a simple communication widget

## Publish and configure the widget 

1. To publish the above sample widget, follow the steps mentioned in [Publish sample app to Azure](sample-softphone-integration.md#bkmk_PublishToAzure). 
2. Then, to configure the widget in your Dynamics 365 instance follow the steps mentioned in [Configure sample app in Dynamics 365](sample-softphone-integration.md#bkmk_Configure).

Once this is done, launch the Unified Interface app to see the communication widget on the right side.

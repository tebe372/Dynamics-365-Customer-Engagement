# Walkthrough: Search and open records on an incoming conversation

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how you can search and open records in Dynamics 365 on an incoming call using the Channel Integration Framework(CIF) APIs.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2017.
- A valid Microsoft Azure subscription is required to publish the sample app to Azure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tutorial is a continuation of [Getting started with building a simple communication widget](getting-started-simple-widget.md). So, if you have not created a simple *Hello World!* widget yet that can be hosted on Channel Integration Framework, we suggest you read that first.

## Add buttons to the *Hello World!* widget

1. Open the basic widget you created using the steps mentioned in [Getting started with building a simple communication widget](getting-started-simple-widget.md) in Visual Studio 2017.
2. Open the `Index.cshtml` file and replace the code in the file with the code given below.

```html

```
3. Run the application in a web browser.
4. Publish the application.

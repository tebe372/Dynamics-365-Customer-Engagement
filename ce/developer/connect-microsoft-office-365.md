[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The [Microsoft Office 365 portal](http://www.microsoft.com/office365) provides a single sign-on experience for [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] customers where they can sign in once and access any [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] application, including [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)]. In addition, system user accounts in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] can be provisioned in the [Microsoft Online Services](http://portal.microsoftonline.com/) admin portal.  
  
 Using federation, applications can connect to [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] using the same system user identities and credentials available in an [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] based network.

# Next steps: Submit your app on Cloud Partner Portal

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Your app is ready for submission after completing steps 1-5. 

If you have been granted access to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) in response to your [app submission form](fill-app-submission-form-appsource.md), proceed to sign in to the portal and [create an offer](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#new/microsoft-crm/form/offerSettings) to submit your app. All apps that are submitted to be listed on AppSource go through a certification process. 

Detailed information about submitting an app for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement is available in the Cloud Partner Portal [documentation](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#documentation/crm-create-offer). Again, the portal documentation is only accessible to authorized users of the Cloud Partner Portal.

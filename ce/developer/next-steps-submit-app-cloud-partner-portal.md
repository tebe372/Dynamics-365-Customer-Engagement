# Next steps: Submit your app on Cloud Partner Portal

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Now that your app is ready for submission, you will use the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) to create an offer to submit your app. All apps that are submitted to be listed on AppSource go through a certification process. 

You can access the Cloud Partner Portal only if you are a member of the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN). We explained how you can enroll for MPN membership in [Step 1: Register for Microsoft Partner Network account](register-microsoft-partner-network.md).

Once your membership request is approved, you will receive the credentials and instructions to sign in to Cloud Partner Portal to [create an offer](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#new/microsoft-crm/form/offerSettings) for your app submission.

Detailed information about submitting an app for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement is available in the Cloud Partner Portal [documentation](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#documentation/crm-create-offer). Again, the portal documentation is only accessible to MPN members.

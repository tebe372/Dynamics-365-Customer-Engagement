# Plug-in registration entities

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The plug-in registration entities define a [!INCLUDE[cc-dyn365-ce-web-services](../includes/cc-dyn365-ce-web-services.md)] message, the entities that support a particular SDK message, and the entities used during plug-in registration. These entities do not apply to custom workflow activities.  
  
 An *SDK Message* defines a message to the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps platform. The message represents the operation that the platform is to perform. You should not create or update a record of this entity.  
  
 An *SDK Message Filter* defines what entity type, for example, account or contact, supports a particular SDK message. It also identifies whether a custom plug-in can be registered for the message and executed when the message is processed by the event execution pipeline.  
  
 The SDK message processing entities are used when registering a plug-in in the event execution pipeline. An *SDK Message Processing Step* entity identifies the event in the pipeline for which a plug-in should be executed. An *SDK Message Processing Step Image* entity stores a snapshot of an entity, including its attributes, during an event that occurs before or after the core platform operation. An *SDK Message Processing Step Secure Configuration* entity stores secure custom information that is passed to a plug-inâ€™s constructor at run-time.

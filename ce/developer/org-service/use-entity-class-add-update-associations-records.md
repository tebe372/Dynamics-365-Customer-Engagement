# Use the Entity class to add or update associations between related records

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] Customer Engagement, you can use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>. <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Associate*> and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Disassociate*> methods to create and remove associations between related records.  
  
 To create an association, you first determine the unique ID of the target entity to be associated. You then create a collection of entities to be associated with the target entity. Next, you define a relationship between the entities in the collection and the target entity. Finally, you pass this information to the `Associate` method. The same information is passed to the `Disassociate` method when you remove an association.  
  
 The following code example shows how to create associations between related records and how to disassociate them.  
  
```csharp  
// The account ID would typically be passed in as an argument or determined by a query.  
// The contact ID would typically be passed in as an argument or determined by a query.  
// Associate the accounts to the contact record.   
//Create a collection of the entity ids that will be associated to the contact.  
EntityReferenceCollection relatedEntities = new EntityReferenceCollection();  
relatedEntities.Add(new EntityReference("account", _account1Id));  
relatedEntities.Add(new EntityReference("account", _account2Id));  
relatedEntities.Add(new EntityReference("account", _account3Id));   
// Create an object that defines the relationship between the contact and account.  
Relationship relationship = new Relationship("account_primary_contact");  
  //Associate the contact with the 3 accounts.  
_orgService.Associate("contact", _contactId, relationship, relatedEntities);   
Console.WriteLine("The entities have been associated.");   
//Disassociate the records.  
_orgService.Disassociate("contact", _contactId, relationship, relatedEntities);   
Console.WriteLine("The entities have been disassociated.");  
```

# Use the Organization Service sample and helper code

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Most managed code samples provided in the [!INCLUDE [pn-sdk](../../includes/pn-sdk.md)] that use the organization and discovery web services are using shared helper code to perform common tasks. You might find this helper code useful in applications that you write. This sample code is available as a NuGet package: [Microsoft.CrmSdk.Samples.HelperCode-CS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CrmSdk.Samples.HelperCode-CS)
  
 When writing an application that uses the .NET SDK assemblies, you typically have to perform a number of steps to configure your applicationâ€™s project. To learn more about setting up a project in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)], or other development environment, see [Quick Start: Organization service sample (C#)](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/org-service/quick-start-org-service-console-app).  
  
To view a sample application that uses the helper code and includes the required .NET references, see [Run a simple program using Customer Engagement web services](../simple-program-web-services.md).  
  
 A non-customized early-bound types file that is named `MyOrganizationCrmSdkTypes` is included in the `Microsoft.CrmSdk.Samples.HelperCode-CS` NuGet package to help get you started. However, if your organization has custom or customized entities, you should generate a new early-bound types file. For the purposes of this documentation, the generated classes are included in the global namespace. For more information, see [Create Early Bound Entity Classes with the Code Generation Tool (CrmSvcUtil.exe)](create-early-bound-entity-classes-code-generation-tool.md).

# Use the sample and helper code
Most managed code samples provided in the [!INCLUDE[pn_sdk](../../includes/pn-sdk.md)] that use the organization and discovery web services are using shared helper code to perform common tasks. You might find this helper code useful in applications that you write. Sample helper code can be found in the following folders in the SDK, and also by following the links provided later in this topic. [!INCLUDE[sdk_download](../../includes/sdk-download.md)]  
  
 `SDK\SampleCode\CS\HelperCode`  
  
 `SDK\SampleCode\VB\HelperCode`  
  
 When writing an application that uses the [!INCLUDE[pn_sdk](../../includes/pn-sdk.md)], you typically have to perform a number of steps to configure your applicationâ€™s project. To learn more about setting up a project in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)], or other development environment, see [Start a managed code project in Visual Studio](start-managed-code-project-visual-studio.md).  
  
 For more information about running the samples included in the [!INCLUDE[pn_sdk](../../includes/pn-sdk.md)] download, see the SDK\SampleCode\Readme.docx. To view a sample application that uses the helper code and includes the required .NET references, see [Quick Start: A Simple Program](simple-program-web-services.md).  
  
 A non-customized early-bound types file that is named `MyOrganizationCrmSdkTypes` is included in the SDK download in the `SampleCode\CS\HelperCode` and `SampleCode\VB\HelperCode` folders to help get you started. However, if your organization has custom or customized entities, you should generate a new early-bound types file. For the purposes of this documentation, the generated classes are included in the global namespace. For more information, see [Create Early Bound Entity Classes with the Code Generation Tool (CrmSvcUtil.exe)](create-early-bound-entity-classes-code-generation-tool.md).

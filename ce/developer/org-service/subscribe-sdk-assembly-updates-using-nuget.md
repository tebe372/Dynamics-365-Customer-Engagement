# Subscribe to SDK assembly updates using NuGet

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

.NET SDK assemblies and some command-line tools are available through a software distribution website called [nuget.org](http://www.nuget.org). Use of [!INCLUDE[tn_nuget](../../includes/tn-nuget.md)] packages in your application project enables you to keep your project up-to-date with the latest releases of the SDK assemblies and tools. [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] has supported this capability since version 2010 and there is even a standalone [!INCLUDE[tn_nuget](../../includes/tn-nuget.md)] client for those developers that don’t develop in [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)]. Another advantage of using [!INCLUDE[tn_nuget](../../includes/tn-nuget.md)] packages in your projects is that assembly references and dependencies are automatically taken care of for you. [!INCLUDE[tn_nuget](../../includes/tn-nuget.md)] packages are available for the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] Customer Engagement SDK as well as for the previous versions – 2011 , 2013, and 2015.

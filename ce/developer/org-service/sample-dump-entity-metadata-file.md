# Sample: Dump entity metadata to a file

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

This sample code is for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] apps. Download the sample: [Work with entity metadata](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Samples-of-entities-916efa41).

## Prerequisites
[!INCLUDE[sdk-prerequisite](../../includes/sdk-prerequisite.md)]
  
## Requirements  
[!INCLUDE[sdk_SeeConnectionHelper](../../includes/sdk-seeconnectionhelper.md)]
  
## Demonstrates  
 This sample shows how to write out all the entity metadata to an XML file. It uses the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveAllEntitiesRequest> message.  
  
 The following sample creates a new file at \Entities\bin\Debug\EntityInfo.xml. You can open this file in [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Excel_Full](../../includes/pn-ms-excel-full.md)] to see a tabular report. You may need this information to discover the entity type code for a custom entity for use in reports.

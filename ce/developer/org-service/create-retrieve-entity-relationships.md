## Create a 1:N entity relationship  
 The following sample uses the [EligibleCreateOneToManyRelationship](#eligiblecreateonetomanyrelationship) method to verify that the `Account` and `Campaign` entities can participate in a 1:N entity relationship and then creates the entity relationship by using <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateOneToManyRequest>.

### EligibleCreateOneToManyRelationship

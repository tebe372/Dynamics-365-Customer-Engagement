# Discovery Service methods

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery.IDiscoveryService> Web service provides a single method you can use to determine the correct organization and URL to use to interact with the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm_server](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm-server.md)].  
  
 To access the `IDiscoveryService` Web service, you add a reference to Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.dll assembly to your [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] project, and then add a `using` or `imports` statement for the Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery namespace.  
  
## Execute  
 Use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery.IDiscoveryService.Execute(Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery.DiscoveryRequest)> method to execute a discovery service message. For a list of the messages you can use with this method, see [Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery Messages](messages-discovery-service.md).

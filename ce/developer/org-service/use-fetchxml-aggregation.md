# Use FetchXML aggregation

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement and [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], `FetchXML` includes grouping and aggregation features that let you calculate sum, average min, max and count.  
  
 The following aggregate functions are supported:  
  
-   sum  
  
-   avg  
  
-   min  
  
-   max  
  
-   count(*)  
  
-   count(*attribute name*)  
  
<a name="Aggregation"></a>

## About aggregation
 
 To create an aggregate attribute, set the keyword `aggregate` to `true`, then specify a valid *entity name*, *attribute name*, and *alias* (variable name). You must also specify the type of aggregation you want to perform.  
  
 The following example shows a simple aggregate attribute in `FetchXML`.  
  
```xml  
<fetch distinct='false' mapping='logical' aggregate='true'>   
   <entity name='entity name'>   
      <attribute name='attribute name' aggregate='count' alias='alias name'/>   
   </entity>   
</fetch>
```  
  
 The result of a query with an aggregate attribute is different from the results of a standard query. The alias value is used as the tag identifier for the aggregate result.  
  
 The following example shows the format of the result of an aggregate query.  
  
```xml
<resultset morerecords="0"'>   
   <result>  
      <alias>aggregate value</alias>  
   </result>  
</resultset>
```  
  
 The following example shows the results of a query when the alias variable is set to `account_count`.  
  
```xml
<resultset morerecords="0"'>   
   <result>  
      <account_count>20</account_count>  
   </result>  
</resultset>
```  
  
<a name="AVG"></a>

## Avg

 The following example shows how to use the `avg``aggregate` attribute.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Query#FetchAggregationAndGroupBy1](../../snippets/csharp/CRMV8/query/cs/fetchaggregationandgroupby1.cs#fetchaggregationandgroupby1)]  
  
### Limitation with null values while computing average  
 **Null** values are not considered when [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] computes the average of data. However, zero (0) is used.  
  
 In the following example, with the following data, the average for Account 1 (two entries) is shown as 250 whereas the average for Account 2 (two entries) is shown as 125.  
  
|Topic|Potential Customer|Estimated value|  
|-----|------------------|---------------|  
|Opportunity 1|Account 1|null|  
|Opportunity 2|Account 1|250|  
|Opportunity 3|Account 2|0|  
|Opportunity 4|Account 2|250|  
  
<a name="count"></a>

## Count

 The following example shows how to use the `count``aggregate` attribute.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Query#FetchAggregationAndGroupBy2](../../snippets/csharp/CRMV8/query/cs/fetchaggregationandgroupby2.cs#fetchaggregationandgroupby2)]  
  
<a name="count_column"></a>

### CountColumn

 The following example shows how to use the `countcolumn``aggregate` attribute to count columns.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Query#FetchAggregationAndGroupBy3](../../snippets/csharp/CRMV8/query/cs/fetchaggregationandgroupby3.cs#fetchaggregationandgroupby3)]  
  
<a name="count_distinct"></a>
 
### Count distinct columns

 The following example shows how to use the `countcolumn``aggregate` attribute with the `distinct` attribute to count distinct columns.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Query#FetchAggregationAndGroupBy4](../../snippets/csharp/CRMV8/query/cs/fetchaggregationandgroupby4.cs#fetchaggregationandgroupby4)]  
  
<a name="max"></a>

## Max

 **Null** values are not considered when [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] computes the maximum of data. However, zero (0) is used.  
  
 The following example shows how to use the `max``aggregate` attribute.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Query#FetchAggregationAndGroupBy5](../../snippets/csharp/CRMV8/query/cs/fetchaggregationandgroupby5.cs#fetchaggregationandgroupby5)]  
  
<a name="min"></a>
 
## Min

 **Null** values are not considered when [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] computes the minimum of data. However, zero (0) is used.  
  
 The following example shows how to use the `min``aggregate` attribute.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Query#FetchAggregationAndGroupBy6](../../snippets/csharp/CRMV8/query/cs/fetchaggregationandgroupby6.cs#fetchaggregationandgroupby6)]  
  
<a name="sum"></a>

## Sum

 The following example shows how to use the `sum``aggregate` attribute.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Query#FetchAggregationAndGroupBy7](../../snippets/csharp/CRMV8/query/cs/fetchaggregationandgroupby7.cs#fetchaggregationandgroupby7)]  
  
<a name="mult_agg"></a>
 
## Multiple aggregates

 The following example shows how to use multiple `aggregate` attributes to set a minimum and maximum.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Query#FetchAggregationAndGroupBy8](../../snippets/csharp/CRMV8/query/cs/fetchaggregationandgroupby8.cs#fetchaggregationandgroupby8)]  
  
<a name="groupby"></a>
 
## Group by

 The following example shows how to use multiple `aggregate` attributes and a linked `groupby` attribute.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Query#FetchAggregationAndGroupBy9](../../snippets/csharp/CRMV8/query/cs/fetchaggregationandgroupby9.cs#fetchaggregationandgroupby9)]

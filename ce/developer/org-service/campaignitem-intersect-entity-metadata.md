# CampaignItem intersect entity metadata

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The `CampaignItem` intersect entity is the intersect table for the following many-to-many relationships for the `Campaign` entity.  
  
|Relationship schema name|Entity 1|Entity 2|  
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|  
|campaignproduct_association|campaign|Product|  
|campaigncampaign_association|campaign|Campaign|  
|campaignsalesliterature_association|campaign|SalesLiterature|  
|campaignlist_association|campaign|List|  
  
 If you are not using early bound types, you might need to know the names of the attributes in this entity to effectively build a query. This information is provided in the following table. [!INCLUDE[metadata_browser](../../includes/metadata-browser.md)]

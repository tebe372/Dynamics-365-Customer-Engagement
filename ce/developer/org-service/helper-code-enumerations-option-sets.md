# Helper code: Enumerations for option sets

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The [Sample: Extension to Generate Enumerations for Option Sets](extend-code-generation-tool.md#Generate_Enums) includes an extension to the CrmSvcUtil code generation tool that you can use to generate enumerations for all option set values including global option sets, picklist, state, and status values. In addition, it includes a helper code file that contains the enumerations generated for all out-of-the-box values. These enumerations can be used in your code by adding the file `SampleCode\CS\HelperCode\OptionSets.cs` or `SampleCode\VB\HelperCode\OptionSets.vb` to your project.  
  
 Each enumeration can be used to test or set the value for a property. Typically this property is an entity attribute but there are a few that are used for other properties.  
  
## Usage Example  
 The following example shows how to use one of these enumerations to set a value in the `Account` entity.

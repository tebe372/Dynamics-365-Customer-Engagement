# Helper code: SystemUserProvider class

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The file is present in code samples' folder that you download.
 
 Path: `download-directory>\<sample name>\C#\SystemUserProvider.cs`.
 
 For example, if you download the **Work with visualizations and dashboards** sample to D drive, you can find the sample in the following folder path.

 Path: `D:\Work with visualizations and dashboards\SystemUserProvider.cs`
  
## Requirements  
 The logged on system user must have system administration privileges for this sample code to create the new user accounts. [!INCLUDE[sdk_SeeConnectionHelper](../../includes/sdk-seeconnectionhelper.md)]  
  
## Demonstrates  
 The **SystemUserProvider** class demonstrates how to programmatically create additional users in [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] and[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] Customer Engagement.  
  
 Several SDK samples require additional (fictitious) system users to exist in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)], other than the logged on user, for the sample to perform its intended task. These samples use the **SystemUserProvider** class methods to create these additional required users. Since it currently is not possible to programmatically create a new [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Live_ID](../../includes/pn-windows-live-id.md)] user, when running against a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] server, the code just prints the required user information to the console. You can then manually add and invite those users if desired.

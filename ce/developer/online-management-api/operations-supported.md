# Operations supported by Online Management API 

[!INCLUDE[](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can perform most of the instance-related operations using the API that you can do using the [Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps Admin Center](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/manage-online-instances). The API also lets you perform some additional operations such as using tenant application identities to create/manage instances and retrieving service versions (releases) for instances.

For a list of operations supported by the API, see [Online Management API reference](/rest/api/admin.services.crm.dynamics.com/)

For a quick start sample on how to authenticate and execute operations using Online Management API, see [Quick Start Sample: Retrieve instances in your tenant](sample-quick-start.md).

Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps are built on the [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro
) platform, which is also the underlying data platform for PowerApps. If you are Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps (on-premises) users, you continue to use the Customer Engagement platform that has similar functionality as Common Data Service.

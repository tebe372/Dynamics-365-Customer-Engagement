Dimensions used for pricing and costing human resources in professional service firms are a finite set of categorizations of:
1. People
2. Work they are to perform

This description of pricing dimensions has led us to exclude the conceptualization of these dimension values as free text descriptions or infinite number series values. Two basic types of pricing dimension values emerge from this conclusion:

1. Dimensions that are fixed enumerations of a set of values (also called option sets)
2. Dimensions that can be a varied set of values (entity-based list of values)

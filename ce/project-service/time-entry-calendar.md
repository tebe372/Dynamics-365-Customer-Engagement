# Time entry calendar

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]

On the **Time Entries** page, you can view the time entries on the calendar by selecting **Show as** \> **Calendar Control**. 
 
## Updated calendar control 
In Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation (PSA) version 3 and above, we deliver a new time entry experience with extensibility. This replaces the Custom Calendar Control in prior versions, you can still view time entries through a read only calendar control provided by the Unified Interface Framework for day, week or monthly views.

The calendar doesnâ€™t support actions on individual calendar items, and you can't select one or more calendar items for submission or deletion. Instead, clicking a calendar item open the **Time Entry** entity page, where you can complete the necessary actions.  

## Extensibility 
On the **Time Entries** page with the time entry grid, you can add additional custom fields, set up lookup fields, and create custom views. You can also set custom business logic based on values selected for or entered into custom fields.

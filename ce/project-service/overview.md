# What is Dynamics 365 for Project Service?

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-apps-all](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-apps-all.md)]

The Project Service application helps project-based organizations track, manage, and deliver services from sales through invoicing. The app enables you to:

- Plan projects, and create estimates and work schedules
- Estimate and track project cost and revenue 
- Forecast resource requirements for projects in the pipeline
- Track project progress and cost consumption
- Manage quoting, pricing, and billing for projects
- Assign and manage resources
- Use reports and interactive dashboards to monitor key performance indicators for successful projects
- ...and more

In addition, to help you maintain cost control for your project-based work, individual consultants 
easily enter and track project time and expenses either on mobile or using a web browser.

The Project Service application helps project-based organizations manage and deliver services from sales through invoicing. The app enables you to:

- Plan projects, and create estimates and work schedules
- Estimate and track project cost and revenue 
- Forecast resource requirements for projects in the pipeline
- Track project progress and cost consumption
- Manage quoting, pricing, and billing for projects
- Assign and manage resources
- Use reports and interactive dashboards to monitor key performance indicators for successful projects
  ...and more

In addition, to help you maintain cost control for your project-based work, individual consultants 
easily enter and track their project time and expenses either on mobile or using a web browser.

There are two flavors of [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-dyn-365-project-service-auto.md)]: 

- If you're using a desktop, you'll use the Project Service Automation app.

- If you’re in the field using a smartphone or tablet, you’ll use the Project Resource Hub app which is a subset of the Project Service Automation app. The Project Resource Hub app is built on the Unified Interface framework, which uses responsive web design principles to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience for any screen size, device, or orientation.

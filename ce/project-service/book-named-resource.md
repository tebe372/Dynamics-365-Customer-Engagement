# Book a named resource directly

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]

You can select a generic resource with a requirement and click Book on the Team tab of the project or open the resource requirement and click the book button there.

This will open the Schedule Assistant which you use to select and book a named resource onto your project team.

When the booking is complete and totally fulfilled by a named resource, the generic resource is replaced with the named resource on the team.

The assignments on the schedule are updated with the named resource as well.

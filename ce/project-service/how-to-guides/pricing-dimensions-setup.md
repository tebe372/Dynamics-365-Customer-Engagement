# Pricing dimensions setup guide 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]

We have updated the content of the Pricing dimensions setup guide and moved it into this document library. 
To learn more about setting up pricing dimensions, see [Pricing and costing dimensions](../pricing-costing-dimensions.md).
 
You can still access and download the [Pricing dimensions setup guide (PDF)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2008805), however we will no longer be updating this guide.

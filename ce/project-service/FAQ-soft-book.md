# Soft book a resource

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]

You can tentatively schedule or "soft book" a resource onto a project team to show that you plan to assign the resource to the project. Soft bookings don’t consume a resource’s available capacity, and you can assign soft-booked team members to project tasks. However, because soft booking doesn’t consume a resource’s capacity, you can still "hard book" the resource for other tasks within the same period. Generic resources can’t be soft-booked, nor can a soft-booking fulfill a request for a generic resource.

Soft-booked project team members are listed on the **Team** tab of the **Project** page, with their soft-booked hours shown in the **Soft Booked Hours** column in the **Named Resources** view. Soft-booked team members are also listed on the schedule board. Because they are soft booked, the schedule board doesn't show any consumption of capacity for these resources. Soft-booked time doesn’t show up on the **Reconciliation** tab, nor is it shown in the **Extend Bookings** field in the **Reconciliation** tab of the schedule board. 

There are two ways to soft book a team member onto a project: directly from the schedule board, or by adding the team member on the **Team** tab. 

## Soft book from the schedule board
Complete the following steps to soft book a resource from the schedule board. 

1. Open the schedule board and in the **Booking Requirements** panel, select the **Project** tab.
2. Find the project for which you want to soft book a resource. If there are a large number of projects in the list, select the Project column header, and then use the filter to search for one or more projects.
3. Select the project, and then drag and drop it on the resource’s time grid.
5. In the **Create Resource Booking** panel, adjust the start and end date, set the **Booking Status** to **Soft**, and then set the hours. 
6. Click **Book**. The resource now shows on the **Team** tab as a resource for the project. On the **Named Team Member** view you’ll see the soft-booked hours in the **Soft Booked Hours** column.

> [!NOTE]
> You can now assign the soft booked to tasks on the **Schedule** tab. On the **Reconciliation** tab, the resource shows a booking deficit relative to the task assignment as the **Reconciliation** tab only considers hard bookings. You can use the **Extend Bookings** feature to hard-book the resource to eliminate the deficit of hard bookings against the resources assignments. You’ll have to manually cancel the soft booking for the resource by using **Maintain Bookings**.

## Soft book on the Team tab

Add team members directly on the **Team** tab, and then change their booking status from Hard to Soft with **Maintain Bookings**. When you add a team member this way, it will always result in a hard booking unless you select the allocation method as **None**.
To use this method, complete the following steps.

1. On the **Team** tab, click **New**.
2. Select the bookable resource, the role, and the from and to dates.
3. Select an allocation method other than **None**.
4. Select **Save**. You’ll see the resource on the grid and their hours in the **Hard Booked Hours** column.
5. Maintain the resource’s bookings by Select **Maintain Bookings**.
6. When the schedule board opens, expand the resource to show their bookings. You will see the booking shown as **Hard**.
7. Right-click the booking, and under **Change Status**, select **Soft Book** \> **Soft**. The booking status is now **Soft**.
8. After you close the schedule board, you’ll see that the hours for the resource have moved from the **Hard Booked Hours** column to the **Soft Booked Hours** on the **Team** tab grid, when looking at the Named **Team Members** view.

> [!NOTE]
> If you hard-book a resource onto the team and then assign tasks in the schedule to teh resource, when you use **Maintain Bookings** to change the status ofrom **Hard** to **Soft**, the task assignments for the resource are retained. However, on the **Reconciliation** tab, the resource will have a booking deficiency because only hard bookings are considered when reconciling bookings versus assignments. You can use the **Extend Bookings** feature on the **Reconciliation** tab to hard-book the resource to eliminate the deficit of hard bookings against the resources assignments. You’ll have to cancel the soft-booking for the resource by using **Maintain Bookings**.

When you’re ready to change a soft-booked team member resource to a hard-booked team member, do the following:

1. On the Schedule board, expand the resource to show their bookings. You’ll see the booking shown as **Soft**.
2. Right-click the booking, and under **Change Status**, select **Hard Book** \> **Hard**. The booking status is now **Hard**.
3. After you close the Schedule board, return to the project, and open the **Team** tab, you’ll see that the hours for the resource have moved from the **Soft Booked Hours** column to the **Hard Booked Hours** column on the **Team** tab when in the **Named Team Members** view. If the resource was assigned to tasks, they’ll no longer show a booking deficit on the **Reconciliation** tab as their bookings are now hard.

## Upgrade from Project Service Automation version 2.x or 1.x to version 3
The release of Project Service Automation (PSA) version 3 includes significant changes. This release is built on the Unified Interface framework for an improved user experience. The redesigned app delivers a consistent, uniform user interface, and follows responsive design principles for optimal viewing on any screen size or device. There have been other changes throughout the application including changes to pricing, booking and assigning resources, time, expenses, and approvals.  

Customers will need to opt-in to install or upgrade to Project Service version 3.x because along with important, new functionality, this version has completely new user experience for the web. Not all customers may be ready to take on this new web client hence the need to make this opt-in. 
Here are instructions to opt-in:
1. Access the Dynamics Insider Portal here: http://experience.dynamics.com/insider
2. Log in with your Insider credentials.
3. On the Insider home page, search for a program with the name “Opt-in to Upgrade Project and Field Service - Unified Interface.”
4. Click that program link in the search results and choose to “Join Now” in the page that opens. This will add you as a participant to the program.
5. On the program page, access the link provided to sign up: “Signup Link to opt-in for the latest Field & Project Service UCI Release (GA)”
6. The link will open a simple questionnaire and one of the questions is the instance URL; please provide the URL of the instance. 
7. Microsoft will receive the details you provide and, within a few days, will enable the install or upgrade of the latest versions of Field and Project Service on the instance that you provided. Once enabled, you will receive a confirmation email from Microsoft.
8. Once you receive the email, you can access your Dynamics 365 Admin portal to install or upgrade Field Service and/or Project Service Automation on the enabled instance. 
9. For any questions and discussion on the functionality, please use the Forum on the program page. Use the Microsoft Support process to log any issues/bugs. 


• If the identified instance has both Field and Project Service installed, please plan to upgrade both solutions before resuming normal use of the instance.
• For a smooth install experience, please make sure that the identified instance meets all the prerequisites listed on the Insider Program page.
• These releases of Field and Project Service will only be available for install or upgrade on the identified instances. They will not show up for any other orgs, even if they are on the same tenant.

# Manage resource requests (Project Service Automation)
Account Managers and Project Managers regularly request resources for their projects. With the [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement, you can find and match consultants who have the required skills and proficiencies to those resource requests.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Resource Requests**.  
  
2.  Select a resource request and click **Find Resources**. This shows a calendar view of all resources and their availability, with color coding that provides a visual view of a resourceâ€™s booking status.  
  
     Do any of the following to optimize your search:  
  
    -   Select a view or sort order from the top of the screen. You can also select whether to show availability for the **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**, and use the arrows to view the previous or next time period. Use the search box to find a specific resource.  
  
    -   Click **Options** to change what displays. For example, you can show a legend that shows the color scheme for the different types of bookings, or you can choose to show only a certain type of booking (for example, hard booking or soft booking).  
  
    -   Click **Filter** to display the **Filter** pane, which lets you filter your results by organizational unit, role, skill, or other attributes.  
  
 ![ProjectService&#95;ResourceRequestScreen](../project-service/media/project-service-resource-request-screen.png "ProjectService_ResourceRequestScreen")  
  
3.  In the calendar for the resource you want to book, select the time period to book the resource, and then either click **Book** to book the resource or **Propose Booking** to propose the booking and have the requestor approve it. When you book a resource, you can soft book or hard book.

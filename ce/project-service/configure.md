# Configure Project Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

Before you can use the [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] automation capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] to manage your accounts, projects, and resources, you need to complete a few configuration steps to ensure the [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] solution matches your organization’s needs. These steps include:  
  
-   [Set up time units](../project-service/set-up-time-units.md). Configure the time units in the product catalog that you’ll use as a base for scheduling and billing your projects.  
  
-   [Set up currencies and exchange rates](../project-service/set-up-currencies-exchange-rates.md). Set up the currencies to use for your projects.  
  
-   [Create organizational units](../project-service/create-organizational-units.md). Set up the groups that your company uses to divide its business, whether by geography, business function, or other logical division.  
  
-   [Set up invoice frequencies](../project-service/set-up-invoice-frequencies.md). Set up time periods that you want to use for billing your clients.  
  
-   [Configure transaction categories](../project-service/configure-transaction-categories.md). Set up transaction categories your consultants can charge their billable and unbillable expenses to.  
  
-   [Configure expense categories](../project-service/configure-expense-categories.md). Set up the categories your consultants can charge their billable and unbillable expenses to.  
  
-   [Create product catalog items](../project-service/create-product-catalog-items.md). Add the products you sell, such as software licenses, to the product catalog.  
  
-   [Create a price list](../project-service/create-price-list.md). Configure different price lists, depending on how much you want to charge your clients for each role their project requires.  
  
-   [Set up resources](../project-service/set-up-resources.md). Add the skills, proficiencies, resource roles, and other resource information that you’ll need for your projects.

# Create a project (Project Service Automation)
Create a project using the [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] capabilities in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] when you want to create an opportunity, quote, or contract for project-based services. The [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] capabilities help you manage your project from opportunity through completion. When you create a project, you’ll also create a work breakdown structure, which affects your quotes, cost estimates, and resource management.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Projects**.  
  
2.  Click **New Project**.  
  
3.  In the **Summary** area, enter a name for your project, and then fill in as many of the details as you can. Items marked with a red asterisk (*) are required.  
  
4.  Click **Save** to create your project so you can continue editing it.  
  
Next, you’ll create a work breakdown structure for your project to define the tasks, timing, and resource roles needed for the project.

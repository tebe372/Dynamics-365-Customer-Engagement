# View resource utilization (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

You can check resource utilization to determine utilization levels for your resources and help you make decisions about how to fully take advantage of your resourcesâ€™ time.  
  
1. Go to **Project Service > Resource Utilization**. 

     This shows a calendar view of all resources and their availability. Select a view or sort order from the top of the screen. You can also select whether to show availability for the **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**, and use the arrows to view the previous or next time period. Use the search box to find a specific resource.      
  
2. Click **Options** to change what displays. For example, you can show a legend that shows the color scheme for the different types of bookings, or you can choose to show only a certain type of booking (for example, hard booking or soft booking).  

3. Click **Filter** to display the **Filter** pane, which lets you filter your results by organizational unit, role, skill, or other attributes.

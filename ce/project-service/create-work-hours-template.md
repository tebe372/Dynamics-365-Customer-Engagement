# Create a work hours template (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

Before you can create project schedules, you need to set up a project calendar that defines the number of working hours to accommodate per day in the schedule and any business closures. You do this with a work hours template, which contains details about work hours per day, days off, and any other business closures.  
  
 When you’re creating a project, you associate a work template to the project calendar to apply the schedule for the project.  
  
 There are two ways you can create a work hours template:  
  
-   Create a work hours template based on a resource’s calendar.  
  
-   Create a new work hours template.  
  
#### To create a work hours template based on a resource’s calendar  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Resources**.  
  
2.  Select the resource you want to base your work hours on.  
  
3.  Click **Save Calendar As**, enter a name for the work hours template, and then click **Save**.  
  
4.  When you’re done changing options, click **Save and Close**.  
  
5.  Click the **Save** button at the bottom right corner of the screen.  
  
#### To create a new work hours template  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Work Hours Templates**.  
  
2.  Click **New**.  
  
3.  Enter a name for the work hours template.  
  
4.  Select a resource to base the work hours on, and then click **Save**.

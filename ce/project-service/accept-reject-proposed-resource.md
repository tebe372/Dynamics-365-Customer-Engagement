# Accept or reject a proposed project resource

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]


When the resource manager proposes a named resource for the project, the **Request Status** field for the generic team member will be updated to **Needs Review**. The request will be sent to the project manager for approval or rejection.

The grid shows the proposed resourceâ€™s current bookings and bookings once the proposal is accepted. From here you can select the proposed resource and click Accept Proposals for them to be booked onto your team.  You can also reject the resource and resubmit the request.
To approve the request, click on the arrow to open to open the team member and click on the Proposed Resources tab.

As with directly fulfilling a generic resource with a named resource, the generic resource will be replaced and the assigned tasks will be updated with the named team member.

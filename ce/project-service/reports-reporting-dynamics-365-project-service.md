Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Project Service (PSA) allows project-based organizations to efficiently manage the operations of their businesses. On any project, team members need to manage the opportunity, quote and plan the work, resource the projects, manage the work according to the plan, bill for the work, and then perform the work to complete the project. The ability to report on operations is key to determining the health of the organization and to taking corrective action when needed. PSA uses Dynamics 365 reporting methods and technologies for all its reporting. To learn more about options for reporting, you can review the [Customer Engagement Reporting and Analytics Guide](../analytics/reporting-analytics-with-dynamics-365.md).

## Report Wizard

The Report Wizard gives non-developers the ability to create simple reports in Dynamics 365. Because PSA is built on the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement platform, the experience is the same as documented in the topic, [Create or edit a report using the Report Wizard](../basics/create-edit-copy-report-wizard.md), although you will use the PSA-specific entities.

## Custom SQL Server Reporting Services reports

If there is a specific report that your business needs that can't be created with the Report Wizard, you can create a custom report. You will need to have Microsoft Visual Studio installed along with the appropriate SQL Server Data Tools and Report Authoring Extensions. For more information about tools and versions, see [Report writing environment using SQL Server Data Tools](../analytics/report-writing-environment-using-sql-server-data-tools). To create a custom report, see [Create a new report using SQL Server Data Tools](../analytics/create-a-new-report-using-sql-server-data-tools).

## Power BI Insights apps

Power BI works together with Microsoft Dynamics 365 to provide a powerful way to work with your data in the form of Insights apps. You can find information on the availability of Insights apps on the [Power BI Insights apps page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi-insights-apps/).

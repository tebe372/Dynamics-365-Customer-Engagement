# View your schedule (Project Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

When you want to see what you’re working on for the week, take a look at your schedule.  
  
 If you’re using the web app:  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Bookings and Tasks**. This brings up a calendar view of your schedule.  
  
2.  Click **Previous** or **Next** to see your schedule for the previous or next week. Click **Today** to get back to the current week. You can click a task to update it, if needed.  
  
3.  If you’d rather see a list of what you’re working on, click **Grid**. You can edit tasks inline, if needed.  
  
4.  To see tasks that you’ve already completed, click **Show Completed Tasks**.

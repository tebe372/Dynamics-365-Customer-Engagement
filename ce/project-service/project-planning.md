Project Service offers end-to-end support for service organizations by providing tools for managing the sales and delivery process. This helps you identify opportunities, submit bids, reach contractual agreements, manage resources, deliver projects on time and within budget, record time and expenses, and invoice the customer.
Team members can collaborate on projects and maintain current and accurate project status, allowing project managers to identify and manage project risks. These advanced tasks are typically performed in larger organizations with separate divisions that work together.

## Project management tools

The project management tools in Dynamics 365 for Project Service (PSA) help you run projects with ease. Built-in templates and scheduling tools help project managers and teams stay productive. The tools help to:

- Plan projects with work schedule and estimates

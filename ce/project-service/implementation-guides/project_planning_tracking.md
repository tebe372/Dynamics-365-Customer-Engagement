Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation provides end-to-end support for service organizations by providing tools for managing the sales and delivery process. This helps you identify opportunities, submit bids, reach contractual agreements, manage resources, deliver projects on time and within budget, record time and expenses, and invoice the customer. This English-language document explains how project managers can use Project Service Automation to estimate work, project costs, and forecast resource requirements.

# Dashboards

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]

Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation includes two system dashboards: **Practice Manager** and **Resource Manager**.

## Practice Manager 

The **Practice Manager** dashboard gives practice managers a graphical dashboard experience for tracking costs, sales, and gross margin and utilization. It also lets practice managers slice the information by various dimensions, such as customer, project, or resource role. For more information about how to create and customize dashboards, see [Create or edit dashboards](../customize/create-edit-dashboards.md).

## Resource Manager 

The **Resource Manager** dashboard gives resource managers a graphical dashboard experience for monitoring resource requests, and resource demand and utilization. It also lets resource managers slice the monitored information by various dimensions.

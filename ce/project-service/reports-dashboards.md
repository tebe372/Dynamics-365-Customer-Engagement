# Dashboards

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]

Project Service (PSA) includes two system dashboards: Practice Manager and Resource Manager.

## Practice Manager 

The Practice Manager Dashboard provides the practice manager with a graphical dashboard experience to track costs, sales, and gross margin and utilization. The dashboard also provides the ability to slice the information by various dimensions such as customer, project, or resource role. For more information on creating and customizing dashboards, see [Create or edit dashboards](../customize/create-edit-dashboards.md).

## Resource Manager 

The Resource Manager Dashboard gives the resource manager a graphical dashboard experience to monitor resource requests and resource demand and utilization. The dashboard also provides the ability to slice the monitored information by various dimensions.

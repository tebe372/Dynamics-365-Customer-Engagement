# Submit a resource request

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]

You can also submit a generated resource requirement as a resource request for fulfillment by a resource manager persona.

Once you have generated a resource requirement for a generic team member, click on the Submit Request button.

![Submitting a resource request](media/RM-how-to-18.png)

The request status of the generic team member will change to Submitted.

Once the request is fulfilled by the resource manager, the generic resource will be replaced by a named resource if the resource manager has fulfilled the request or the generic resource will remain on the team and the request status will change to Needs Review, if the resource manager has proposed a named resource.

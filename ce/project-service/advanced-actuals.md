# Recording actuals 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-3.x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-3x.md)]

Project Service Automation (PSA) records the financial transactions that occur during a project. These transactions are recorded as **actuals**. The following table shows the different types of actuals that are created based on whether the project type is time and material, fixed-price, or internal, or if the project is in the presales stage.

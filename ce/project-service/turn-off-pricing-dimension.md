# Turn off a default or a custom pricing dimension

You may need to revisit your pricing strategy every few years and that may necessitate turning off an exisitng pricing dimension and creating a new one. For eg: May be that you priced by role but after a few years, you may decide to price by Work Experience level and not Role. This may require you to turn off Role as a pricing dimension and create "Work Expereince" as a pricing dimension. 

Turning off a pricing dimension, either the out-of-the-box Project Service dimensions such as msdyn_resourcecategory (Role) and msdyn_organizationalunit (Organizational Unit) or any other custom pricing dimension can be done by setting Applicable to Cost and/or Applicable to Sales fields of the Pricing Dimension to “No”

However, doing so will bring up this error message:

*Business Process Error likely when turning off a pricing dimension*
![Business Process Error likely when turning off a pricing dimension](media/Business-Process-Error.png)


This error message indicates that there are previously set up price records for the dimension that is being turned off. It is required that all “role price” and “role price markup” records that refer to a dimension be deleted before the dimension’s applicability can be to set to “No.” This rule applies to both out-of-the-box Project Service pricing dimension and any custom pricing dimension that you may have created. The reason for this validation is the following:

Project Service has a constraint that each Role price record has a unique combination of dimensions. For instance, let’s say on a Price List called “US Cost Rates 2018,” you have the following Role price rows: 

| Standard Title         | Org Unit    |Unit   |Price  |Currency  |
| -----------------------|-------------|-------|-------|----------|
| Systems Engineer|Contoso US|Hour| 100|USD|
| Senior Systems Engineer|Contoso US|Hour| 150| USD|


Turning off Standard Title as pricing dimension will mean that when Project Service pricing engine searches for a price, it will only use Org Unit value from the Input context. If the Org Unit of the input context is “Contoso US”, the result will be non-deterministic since both the rows will match. To avoid this scenario, during the creation of Role price records, Project Service validates that the combination of dimensions is unique. If the dimension is turned off **AFTER**  the creation of Role Price records, this constraint can be violated. It is, therefore, required that you delete all Role Price and Role Price Markup rows that have that dimension value populated before you turn off a dimension.

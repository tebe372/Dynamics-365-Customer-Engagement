# Frequently asked questions about Microsoft Social Engagement service discontinuation

## Announcements related to discontinuation of service for Microsoft Social Engagement 

###	What is being announced about Microsoft Social Engagement? 

Effective January 16, 2019, Microsoft Social Engagement will no longer be included as part of any Microsoft Dynamics 365 license entitlement for new customers. Current customers with license entitlements to Microsoft Social Engagement will continue to be able to access the service and add any additional social post capacity as needed, until the earlier of these dates: the expiration of your subscription or January 16, 2020. Effective January 16, 2020, Microsoft Social Engagement will be discontinued for all Dynamics 365 customers.

###	Why is Microsoft Social Engagement being discontinued? 

Dynamics 365 will focus on enabling businesses with AI-powered social and web insights rather than just with social listening capabilities. Hence, Microsoft Social Engagement will be discontinued. Combined capabilities and insights through social and web interactions powered by sources such as Bing search, will be offered through [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Market Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/market-insights/). The social and web insights can help marketing, social media and product teams understand what their customers and competitors are saying, seeking, and feeling.

###	How will current Microsoft Social Engagement customers be notified?

The announcement will be communicated through periodic customer emails and existing communication channels to all Microsoft Social Engagement admins starting January 16, 2019. 

###	What is the recommended path for Microsoft Social Engagement customers and prospects?

With the discontinuation of Microsoft Social Engagement, new prospects and existing Microsoft Social Engagement customers are being asked to try the public preview of [Dynamics 365 Market Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/market-insights/). The public preview is planned for release in the [countries and regions and in the languages listed in the Availability Guide](https://aka.ms/dynamics_365_international_availability_deck). 
Dynamics 365 Market Insights is an application that can help enterprises gain insights and increase their markets by monitoring external information sources, such as social media and trending search terms on the web. Unlike other solutions in the market, this application provides social and web insights, along with AI-powered sentiment and intent analysis features. This helps businesses understand their customers, build their brand, gain competitive advantage, and support their unique needs.

## Dynamics 365 Market Insights

###	What is the Microsoft Social Engagement to Dynamics 365 Market Insights transitional experience?

The transition to Dynamics 365 Market Insights is intended to be a seamless experience for current Microsoft Social Engagement customers. When Social Engagement customers sign into Market Insights, their data and configurations from Social Engagement should be accessible and available in Market Insights. However, note that the user interface for Market Insights might be subject to change in the future. 

###	What are the key capabilities of Dynamics 365 Market Insights?

The key features of Dynamics 365 Market Insights fall within three categories:
-	**Search Insights**: Know what your customers are saying, seeking, and feeling by acquiring audience insights from Bing search. Access demographic and historical insights to align marketing and product development activities. Turn these insights into actions by developing targeted campaigns. 
-	**Social Insights**: Listen to what customers and competitors are saying, and track how their sentiment changes over time through automatic sentiment analysis. Leverage the power of AI to detect intent within social posts and help you identify new leads or respond to service questions.
-	**Brand Reputation**: Use machine learning to tweak sentiment detection in a way thatâ€™s tailored to your organization. Identify, track, and engage with individual influencers and experts on social media so you never miss a post from an influencer.

Refer to the [Release Notes](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-applications/release/) for information about additional capabilities for future release.

### What is the difference in capabilities between Microsoft Social Engagement and Dynamics 365 Market Insights?

Dynamics 365 Market Insights will focus more on enabling businesses with AI-powered social and web insights and will have combined capabilities and insights from Microsoft Social Engagement and Bing Search. The public preview release of Market Insights currently contains the original capabilities of Microsoft Social Engagement on the same UI, along with new features such as age and demographics insights from Bing search.

# Frequently asked questions about Microsoft Social Engagement service discontinuation

## Announcements related to discontinuation of service for Microsoft Social Engagement 

###	What is being announced about Microsoft Social Engagement? 

Effective January 16, 2019, Microsoft Social Engagement (MSE) will no longer be included as part of any Dynamics 365 license entitlement for new customers. Current customers with license entitlements to Microsoft Social Engagement will continue to be able to access the service, and add any additional social post capacity as needed, until the earlier of the expiration of your subscription or January 16, 2020. Effective January 16, 2020, Microsoft Social Engagement will be discontinued for all Dynamics 365 customers.

###	Why is Microsoft Social Engagement being discontinued? 

Dynamics 365 will focus on enabling businesses with AI-powered social and web insights rather than just with social listening capabilities. Hence, Microsoft Social Engagement will be discontinued. Combined capabilities and insights through social and web interactions powered by sources such as Bing search, will be offered through [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Market Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/market-insights/). The social and web insights can help marketing, social media and product teams understand what their customers and competitors are saying, seeking, and feeling.

###	How will current Microsoft Social Engagement customers be notified?

The announcement will be communicated through periodic customer emails and existing communication channels to all Microsoft Social Engagement admins starting January 16, 2019.

The public preview is planned for release in the [countries and languages listed in the Availability Guide](https://aka.ms/dynamics_365_international_availability_deck). 
Dynamics 365 Market Insights is an application that can help enterprises gain insights and increase its market by monitoring external information sources, such as social media and trending search terms on the web. Unlike other solutions in the market, this application provides social and web insights, along with AI-powered sentiment and intent analysis features. This helps businesses understand their customers, build their brand, gain competitive advantage, and support their unique needs.

## Dynamics 365 Market Insights

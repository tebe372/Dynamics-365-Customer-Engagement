# Discontinuation of service for Microsoft Social Engagement

Due to the upcoming changes in product direction, 

- Dynamics 365 Market Insights Preview (MI) will deprecate the current application experience, including all social engagement capabilities, on July 1, 2019. 
- Starting October 1, 2019, Microsoft Social Engagement (MSE) will no longer support Twitter as a data source. 
- As addressed in prior communications, Microsoft Social Engagement will be available only until the expiration of your current subscription period or January 16, 2020, whichever is earlier. 

If you are seeking a social engagement solution, we recommend you look in [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?search=social) or other marketplaces. 

[Dynamics 365 Market Insights Preview](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/market-insights/) offers a new experience that provides email alerts containing news and insights based on US web data. This application will evolve to help business professionals gain aggregated insights based on their audiencesâ€™ web activities such as search, browse and other signals. More information about roadmap capabilities will be available in October 2019 release notes, expected to be shared in June 2019.

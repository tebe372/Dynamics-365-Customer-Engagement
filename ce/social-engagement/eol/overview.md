# Discontinuation of service for Microsoft Social Engagement

Effective January 16, 2019, Microsoft will no longer offer Microsoft Social Engagement as part of the Dynamics 365 subscription for new customers. Current Dynamics 365 customers are entitled to continue using the Microsoft Social Engagement service for the remainder the contract or until the discontinuation of service on January 16, 2020, whichever is sooner. These changes may require your organization to take advance action prior to the end of your contract, to transition to an alternative solution.

With the discontinuation of service, we suggest to try [the public preview of Microsoft Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/market-insights/) to help meet your needs. Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights is an application that can help users gain insights and win market share by monitoring external information sources, both social media and trending search terms on the web. Unlike other solutions in the market, this easy to use application provides holistic social and web insights, intelligent sentiment and intent analysis features.

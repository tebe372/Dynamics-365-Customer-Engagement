# [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Account search and [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] keyword search removal

On December 11, 2018, two changes are introduced in [!INCLUDE [pn-social-engagement-short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] regarding [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] as a data source. We're adding search rules for owned [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Business Accounts search and the removal of the [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] keyword search. 

## [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] keyword search removal
Keyword searches are retired by [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] on December 11, 2018. Due to this change we are also removing the keyword searches  functionality in [!INCLUDE [pn-social-engagement-short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. 

## How [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] keyword search rules work after December 11, 2018?

Since the functionality of [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] keyword searches is removed starting December 11th, no new keyword search queries for [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] can be setup. 

Existing keyword search rules containing [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] as a source will continue to exist as is, and the data acquired for these rules is preserved, as long as the rules are not changed.
If the user changes such a rule, [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] needs to be removed as a source to be able to save the edited search rule.

In case you want to preserve your [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] data acquired to date, we recommend that you setup a separate rule with the changes, and keep the rule with [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] as is.. 

## Introduction of [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Business Account search

With December 11th a new functionality for [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] is available in [!INCLUDE [pn-social-engagement-short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. Users will now be able to acquire posts and comments from their own [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Business accounts. To be able to acquire data from owned [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts, those accounts need to be [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Business accounts and need to be connected to the corresponding [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page. [Find more information on how to connect an Instagram Business account with a Facebook page.](https://help.instagram.com/356902681064399)

The acquisition of posts and comments from owned [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts is done through the [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] GRAPH API using a user token and thus relying on individual user permissions. All [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] tokens must have admin permissions on all [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages and linked [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] business accounts used in Social Engagement.
To be able to acquire [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] posts and comments the user needs to re-authenticate (or authenticate in case of new users) his [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] and [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] acquisition accounts in Social Profiles in [!INCLUDE [pn-social-engagement-short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. The [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] Acquisition profile in Social Profiles has been renamed to [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] and [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Acquisition. Users need to be Administrator of the [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] Page where their [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Business Account is linked to, to be able to authenticate within [!INCLUDE [pn-social-engagement-short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. To be able to acquire the posts and identify the [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts linked to the [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page, we are requesting the following two permissions: *Instagram_Basic* and *Pages_show_list* along with the permissions to acquire data from [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages. During the authentication the user has the choice to disallow the use of those permissions, but will not be able to use the [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] functionality in [!INCLUDE [pn-social-engagement-short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] by doing so. 

![Add a social profile for Facebook and Instagram acquisition](media/instagram-acquisition-profile.png)

To acquire posts and comments, you also will need to set up [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] account rules in Search Setup. The [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts linked to your [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages are listed in the [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] account rules setup and can be simply chosen with a click for the setup. 

In case you are not interested in using the [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] functionality you donâ€™t have to re-authenticate your [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] Acquisition accounts immediately.

# Set your preferences for the user interface
When Administrators set up [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)], they define default values that apply to all users of the same solution. However, you can override the Administratorâ€™s defaults to display the user interface according to your requirements. For your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] profile, you can select the following:  
  
-   Screen language  
  
-   Default time frame in Analytics  
  
-   Preferred color theme  
  
-   Date and time format  
  
-   Number format

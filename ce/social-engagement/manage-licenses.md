# Manage licenses for Social Engagement

Using the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] admin center, you can manage [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] user licenses and other services. This topic provides information about the steps to give users access to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)].  
You must be your organization's [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] administrator to perform the following tasks.

## Prepare your organization

For step-by-step instructions on adding a service to an existing [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription, see [Office help: Manage a subscription](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=392376).

As a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] customer, review [Microsoft Dynamics 365 pricing and licensing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=401462) if the organization is eligible for [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] user licenses.

If your school or work organization doesn't have an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription yet, you need to create an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] tenant for your organization.

### Sign up for a new organization on Office 365

1. Sign up on [Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=390650).

2. Follow the wizard to create your organization and your administrator account.

3. Optionally, select the number of users that you plan to provide access for.

4. Optionally, select add-ins to enhance your post quota.

5. Complete the purchase process to start provisioning [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)].

It takes a few minutes to complete the provisioning process before you can start using [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. You'll receive an email with the details to access your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] instance when it's set up. You are now ready to [sign in](../social-engagement/sign-in.md) and [set up](../social-engagement/administer-microsoft-social-engagement.md) [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)].

## Assign a license to a user

Enable users to work with [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] by assigning [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] licenses to them. As an administrator you can always [modify the user's permissions](../social-engagement/assign-user-roles.md) to use certain features.  

1.  In the [Office 365 portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=390650), click **USERS** > **Active Users**, and then select the user.

2.  In the **Licenses** tab, select the **[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]** check box.

3.  Click **Save** ![Save button](../social-engagement/media/save-icon.png "Save button").  

## Remove a license from a user

When you [create an Office 365 user account](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526143), you normally [assign a license](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=390651) to users so that they can use certain features. 

When you [remove the assigned license](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526144) from a user in your subscription, the license assigned to that user automatically becomes available for assignment to a different user. If you want the user to still have access to other applications that you manage through [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)], for example [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange-online.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)], don't delete the user. Instead, remove the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] license you've assigned to the user.  
Removing a user's license  from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] deletes all related custom settings, alerts, and any owned or shared streams. Deleted custom settings can't be restored. Search topics owned by a removed user will remain.

1. In the Office 365 portal, click **USERS** > **Active Users**, and then select a user.

2. In **Licenses**, clear the **[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]** check box.

3. Click **Save** ![Save button](../social-engagement/media/save-icon.png "Save button").

## Purchase licenses or add other Office 365 plans

You can purchase and add licenses and other plans to your subscription any time. You must be a global or billing administrator for your company's account to purchase licenses or add other [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] plans to your subscription.

### Purchase additional licenses

1. In the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], click **PURCHASE SERVICES**.

2. Select the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] add-in or user licenses you want to purchase, and then click the **Buy now** button ![Buy now button](../social-engagement/media/buy-now-button.png "Buy now button").

3. Customize your order by choosing the number of licenses you'd like to order. When you have the number of licenses you want, click **Check out now**.

4. Follow the checkout procedure to confirm your purchase.

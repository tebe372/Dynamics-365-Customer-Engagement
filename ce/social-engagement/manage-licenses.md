# Manage licenses for Social Engagement
Using  the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] admin center, you can manage [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] user licenses and other services. This topic provides information about the steps to give users access to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] and the features available for each user license type.  
  
<a name="prep_org"></a>   
## Prepare your organization  
 For step-by-step instructions on adding a service to an existing [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription, see [Office help: Manage a subscription](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=392376).  
  
 If your organization is an existing [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] customer review [Microsoft Dynamics CRM pricing and licensing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=401462) if the organization is eligible for [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] user licenses.  
  
 If your school or work organization doesn't have an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription yet, you need to create an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] tenant for your organization.  
  
#### Sign up for a new organization on Office 365  
  
1.  Sign up on [Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=390650).  
  
2.  Follow the wizard to create your organization and your administrator account.  
  
3.  Select the number of users that you plan to provide access for. (Optional)  
  
4.  Select add-ins to enhance your post quota. (Optional)  
  
5.  Complete the purchase process to start provisioning [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)].  
  
     It takes a few minutes to complete the provisioning process before you can start using [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. You’ll receive an email with the details to access your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] instance when it’s set up.

## Available licenses for Microsoft Social Engagement  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You need to assign a license to each user account before users can start using the online service. You can do this either when creating the user account or at a later time. Regardless of the type of license assigned to a user, as an administrator you can always modify the user’s rights to use certain features. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Assign permissions and user roles](../social-engagement/assign-user-roles.md "Assign permissions and user roles")  
>   
>  Your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] instance can have a combination of Professional and Enterprise users, and you can remove or switch existing licenses based on your changing business needs. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Assign a license to a user](http://go.Microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=390651)  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] offers two types of user licenses:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] Professional license  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] Enterprise license  
  
 An Enterprise license provides users with additional functionality compared to Professional licenses.  
  
 This table lists the significant differences between the two license types. Features that have the same functionality for all licenses aren't included in this table.

## Manage user licenses  
 To provide access to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] for users of your organization, you need to assign them a [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] license.  
  
 For step-by-step instructions about how to assign user licenses in [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)], see [Assign a license to a user](http://go.Microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=390651).  
  
 While managing your subscription to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] through the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)] using the Office 365 portal, you need to create a user account for users who need access to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. To learn more about how to view, modify, and delete subscriptions in [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)], see [Office help: Manage a subscription](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526142).  
  
### Assign a license to a user  
 Set up new users by assigning licenses to them.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must be your company’s [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] administrator to perform this task.  
  
##### Add a Social Engagement license to a user  
  
1.  In the [Office 365 portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=390650), click **USERS** > **Active Users**, and then select the user.  
  
2.  In the **Licenses** tab, select the **[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]** check box.  
  
3.  Click **Save** ![Save button](../social-engagement/media/save-icon.png "Save button").  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  To provide the required permissions for a user in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], you need to assign user roles in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Understand user roles](../social-engagement/user-roles.md)  
  
<a name="RemoveLicense"></a>   
### Remove or switch licenses  
 To get the most out of your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] instance, you might consider upgrading or downgrading user licenses based on your changing business needs. When you [create an Office 365 user account](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526143), you normally [assign a license](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=390651) to that user so that they can use certain features.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Because the Enterprise license offers more features, downgrading an Enterprise user to a Professional user can have consequences, with the user potentially losing more assets than in an upgrade scenario.  
  
 Before you can change the license assigned to a user, you must [remove the assigned license](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526144), delete the related user account in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], and then create an account for the user. Removing a user’s license  from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] deletes all related custom settings, alerts, and any owned or shared streams. In addition, users who share streams with the deleted user will lose those streams as well. Deleted custom settings can’t be restored. Search topics owned by a removed user will remain. You must be your company’s [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] administrator to remove a user license.  
  
##### Remove a Social Engagement license from a user  
  
1.  In the Office 365 portal, click **USERS** > **Active Users**, and then select a user.  
  
2.  In **Licenses**, clear the **[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]** check box.  
  
3.  Click **Save** ![Save button](../social-engagement/media/save-icon.png "Save button").  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can also delete users from the [Office 365 portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=390650). When you remove a user from your subscription, the license assigned to that user automatically becomes available for assignment to a different user. If you want the user to still have access to other applications that you manage through [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)], for example [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange-online.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)], don't delete the user. Instead, remove the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] license you've assigned to the user.  
  
<a name="PurchaseLicenses"></a>   
### Purchase licenses or add other Office 365 plans  
 You can purchase and add licenses and other plans to your subscription any time. You must be a global or billing administrator for your company’s account to purchase licenses or add other [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] plans to your subscription in the Office 365 portal:  
  
##### Purchase additional licenses  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], click **PURCHASE SERVICES**.  
  
2.  Select the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] add-in or user licenses you want to purchase, and then click the **Buy now** button ![Buy now button](../social-engagement/media/buy-now-button.png "Buy now button").  
  
3.  Customize your order by choosing the number of licenses you’d like to order. When you have the number of licenses you want, click **Check out now**.

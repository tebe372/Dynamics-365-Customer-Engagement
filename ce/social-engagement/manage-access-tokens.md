# Manage access tokens
[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] requires you to provide access tokens in order to acquire data and interact with posts for social profiles. [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] profiles, [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages, and [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] profiles, require access tokens before you can acquire and interact with posts. [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts require access tokens to acquire posts. Access tokens enable data acquisition and can be easily supplied by logging into your social media account. Acquisition tokens will not post anything to personal [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)], or [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts. We advise users to add at least two different tokens to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. Adding more tokens can guarantee a faster data acquisition and reduce the risk of data acquisition stopping due to expired access tokens. Before adding a user token, make sure you have the appropriate user roles to add a social profile.[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage social profiles](../social-engagement/manage-social-profiles.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Providing an access token is mandatory; not providing one will prevent [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] from acquiring private messages from [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages and [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)]. The access tokens received from users are stored and encrypted in a secure database. The data acquired with tokens is not shared with any other [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] solutions.  
  
 The following table shows the tokens you need to add for your social profiles.

## Tokens for data acquisition  
 Adding tokens for data acquisition allows you to acquire posts from [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] and [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)]. Itâ€™s important to understand that acquiring  is a two-step process. After you add tokens and allow the data acquisition, you will not automatically start seeing posts. A power analyst or administrator needs to add a search rule for the added social profile when they set up a search topic in order to start analyzing posts from [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] and [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)]. After users add a social profile and allowed data acquisition, they can also monitor [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages and [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts they do not own.

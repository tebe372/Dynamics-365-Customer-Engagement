# Personalize the Social Selling Assistant
When using the Social Selling Assistant for the first time, users will get recommendations for all available search topics in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]. To personalize the experience, we recommend each user to select specific topics that are of interest to them. Additionally, users must add their social profiles to be able to share content recommendations on their networks.  
  
## Access the Social Selling Assistant dashboard  
 To access the Social Selling Assistant in [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_365](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365.md)], go to **Sales** > **Dashboards** and select the **Social Selling Assistant dashboard**.  
  
 ![Screenshot of Dynamics 365 for Sales with the Social Selling Assistant dashboard selected.](../social-engagement/media/dashboard-social-selling-assistant.png "Screenshot of Dynamics 365 for Sales with the Social Selling Assistant dashboard selected.")  
  
 If you don't see the Social Selling Assistant dashboard, contact your [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_365](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365.md)] administrator.

## Personalize the Social Selling Assistant  
 When you open the Social Selling Assistant for the first time, you can personalize its experience. We currently offer two types of recommendations: for sharing content and for getting insights. Select which search topics you find relevant and choose if you want to get insights about a group of search topics. Additionally, you add social profiles to share the recommended content.  
  
#### Configure your personal experience  
  
1.  Open the Social Selling Assistant.  
  
2.  In the personalization wizard, click **Personalize**.  
  
3.  Click **Share Content**, select the search topics that are relevant for you and click **Save** ![Save button](../social-engagement/media/save-icon.png "Save button") to apply your changes.  
  
 ![Screenshot of five selected search topics for the Social Selling Assistant personalization settings.](../social-engagement/media/select-search-topics-social-selling-assistant.png "Screenshot of five selected search topics for the Social Selling Assistant personalization settings.")  
  
4.  Click **Get Insights** and manage the topics you want insights for. For example, you may create a new insight group for your business partners and add search topics relating to your partners to get insights, so you can stay on top of what your partners are saying on social media. Click **Save** ![Save button](../social-engagement/media/save-icon.png "Save button") to apply your changes.  
  
 ![Overview of the "Get Insights" configuration, showing the default insight groups along with controls to add, edit, or delete them.](../social-engagement/media/insight-groups-social-selling-assistant.png "Overview of the "Get Insights" configuration, showing the default insight groups along with controls to add, edit, or delete them.")  
  
     By default, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] creates Insight Groups for **Customers**, **Competitors**, and **My brands**. You can edit (![Edit button](../social-engagement/media/edit-icon.png "Edit button")), or remove (![Delete button](../social-engagement/media/trashbin-icon.png "Delete button")) them, and create (![Add button](../social-engagement/media/add-icon.png "Add button")) additional insight groups.  
  
5.  If you have a responder or manager interaction role, click **Social Profiles** to add profiles you own. You can add profiles from LinkedIn [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] to share content directly from the Social Selling Assistant. If your administrator shared a social profile with you, you can select it from the list. To add a social profile or to share a social profile you own with other users, see [Manage social profiles](../social-engagement/manage-social-profiles.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you’ve set the dark theme in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], the Social Selling Assistant will inherit this setting.

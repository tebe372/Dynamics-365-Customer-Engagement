# Find out what&#39;s covered by sources

[!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] provides a number of sources so you can keep track of conversations on your social media. [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] covers multiple sources where you can track public posts, and publish messages and replies. All sources can be filtered in Analytics for an up close look at your data. Find out what is covered with the following available sources. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use filters to see relevant data](../social-engagement/use-filters.md), [Set up searches to listen to social media conversations](../social-engagement/set-up-searches.md)

[//]: # (TODO: Michael to replace all links with inline links)

## Blogs
Create keyword rules for full coverage for blog posts from Tumblr, broad coverage of blog posts from WordPress, and for blog posts from a third aggregated blog source, including a variety of blogs that range from blog aggregators like Blogger.com to small single-site blogs. If you want to update existing search topics to include the extended coverage of the blogs source, you can edit your existing keyword search rules.

To add a keywords rule, see [Add a keywords rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#addKeywordsRule).

## Custom sources

Get full coverage of public RSS or Atom feeds added in your custom source groups. Gather all posts from a previously-created group of custom sources by creating a custom source rule. You can also create a keyword rule to filter by keywords.

To set up a custom sources rule, see [Add a custom sources rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#customSourceRule).

## Disqus

Posts and comments published on Disqus are available for keyword searches.

To add a keywords rule, see [Add a keywords rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#addKeywordsRule).

## Facebook

Monitor posts and comments on [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages without age restriction or geographical restriction that are added to your [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page rules. You can also gather private messages for [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages if you add a social profile and explicitly allow the acquisition of private messages.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] groups, [unpublished Page posts](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/835452799843730) (formerly known as dark posts), and status updates are not available for monitoring or engagement at this time.

To add a [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page rule, see [Add a Facebook pages rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#addFacebookRule).

To add a private messages rule for [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages, see [Add a private messages rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#privateMessagesRule).

## Forums
Keyword rules for forums are available to give you broad coverage of forum posts and comments.

## Instagram
After you add an [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] account to a social profile in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)], you need to allow the data acquisition for that profile. After you allow the data acquisition, you can configure search topics that contain [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] as a source. You can create a keyword search rule for #hashtags to receive posts from [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)], and you can set up [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] account rules to gather all posts and comments on a specific [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] account.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] is a listening source only. You will not be able to  engage on [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] from within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. #Hashtags are mandatory to search Instagram accounts with keyword rules. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage social profiles](../social-engagement/manage-social-profiles.md)

To add an [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] rule, see [Add an Instagram rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#instagram_rule).

## News

You can also gather direct messages if you add a social profile and explicitly allow the acquisition of private messages.

To add a [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] rule, see [Add a Twitter rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#addTwitterRule).

To add a private messages rule, see [Add a private messages rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#privateMessagesRule).

## Videos

Video posts and comments published on [!INCLUDE[tn_youtube](../includes/tn-youtube.md)] that mention a configured search term and match the configured search languages are available for [keyword searches](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#addKeywordsRule).

Video posts and comments on specific [!INCLUDE[tn_youtube](../includes/tn-youtube.md)] channels are available in [YouTube rules](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#add-a-includetnyoutubeincludestn-youtubemd-rule). Please keep in mind that videos often get a lot of comments which affect the monthly post quota.

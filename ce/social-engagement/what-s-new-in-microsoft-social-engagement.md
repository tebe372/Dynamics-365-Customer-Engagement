[//]: # (@Michael, I made all these netbreeze tokens short. If I understand the latest mail on the subject, we never need the long version when the topics are published on Docs. Also, I made all "update" occurrences lowercase, which I did find a guideline for in OneNote on the "Tokens for Centaurus, Potassium and later" page.)
# What&#39;s new in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]
Welcome to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. Here's a list of features we added recently. 
 
If youâ€™re new to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], see [Get started with Social Engagement](../social-engagement/get-started.md). 
 
For a detailed list of improvements and bug fixes for the latest release, see our [blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/tag/social-engagement-kb-articles/). 
 
 For important, late-breaking information and a list of known issues, see the [Social Engagement Readme](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=393612). 

[//]: # (About the verb tenses in these sections: Can a user choose to update to a specific version, or is he compelled to have the latest version if he updates at all? I ask because if the current update is always going to be installed, the "what's new" from all the previous updates should really be past tense. So for the present update, "we've continued..." but for the previous updates, "we addressed service and product improvements with this release..." It's not an important distinction, but I did find the continual present tense from these update descriptions kind of jarring.)
## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] 2017 update 1.6

### Improved base model for sentiment analysis

[//]: # (Edit assumes that we added training data, rather than modified additional training data.)
To improve and refine the base sentiment model, we've modifed the machine learning process and added training data. You don't have to do anything to benefit from these improvements. If you activated [adaptive learning](../social-engagement/adaptive-learning.md) for your organization, all the edits you've made to sentiment values will automatically be applied to the improved base model.

### Improved load-balancing for data acquisition

[//]: # ("all day, every day" instead of "24/7" is from the Msft Writing Style Guide.)
Performance and reliability are key to providing a stable data acquisition pipeline that can handle massive amounts of data all day, every day. Emerging trends or events often generate a significant number of posts on social media. To make the data acquisition service even more reliable and stable, we've improved the way the system handles these varying volumes of data.

### Service and product improvements

For a detailed list of improvements and bug fixes for the latest release, see our [blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/tag/social-engagement-kb-articles/). 

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] 2017 update 1.5

### Service and product improvements
[//]: # (I made a lot of changes here just to keep things more direct and less self-congratulatory. You of course can reject them.)
We've addressed service and product improvements with this release. For changes we've made to the user experience, please see [this detailed blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2017/06/09/whats-new-in-microsoft-social-engagement-2017-update-1-5/).

[//]: # (I assume "the Social Selling Assistant" is the true name--or maybe it isn't--but I'm not sure what the full description should be: it's "Social Assistant within Social Engagement" here, "Social Engagement Social Selling Assistant" later, and on AppSource it's "Dynamics 365 - Social Selling Assistant." I'll leave it up to you to name it, but please make it consistent.)
Additionally, we've continued our ongoing investment to make [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] more accessible. With the current release, Social Selling Assistant within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] supports keyboard navigation and screen readers on mobile and desktop devices.

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] 2017 update 1.4 
 
### Engagement Analytics with [!INCLUDE[Power BI](../includes/pn-power-bi.md)] 
 We've added an Engagement Analytics report to our recently introduced [!INCLUDE[Power BI](../includes/pn-power-bi.md)] content pack for [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. Along with the previously released Engagement Performance and Team Performance reports, the Engagement Analytics report gives you additional insights about your engagement on social media by using metrics based on location, sentiment, tags, and authors. The data model is also enhanced to include these additional dimensions, giving you more power to explore and analyze your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] data.

[//]: # (Is it called a "card" throughout MSE content?)
### Improved usability in Social Selling Assistant 
 The Social Selling Assistant user experience got its first polishing pass, and now the **Done** button appears next to the other actions at the bottom of the card. 
 
 [//]: # (I'm not sure what "Analytics" refers to in the phrase "Post view in Analytics". Can you give a longer product or feature name, or will it be obvious to the reader?)
 We aligned the forms in Social Selling Assistant configuration and the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] Settings page **User Preferences** with industry standards. Now when those forms are edited, the **Save** and **Cancel** buttons appear at the bottom of the input form. Additionally, the main navigation contains a direct link to the Post view in Analytics, filtered for private messages, so you can get to your customers' messages in a single click.

### [!INCLUDE[Power BI](../includes/pn-microsoft-power-bi.md)] content pack for [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] 
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] introduces the [!INCLUDE[Power BI](../includes/pn-microsoft-power-bi.md)] content pack to get insights about your engagement and team performance on social media. This content pack is designed specifically for community managers, providing performance metrics for engagement actions taken from within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. Track metrics, such as the number of actions taken and average response times, and get visibility into the performance of each member of your team. [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi](../includes/pn-power-bi.md)] automatically creates the dashboard and generates reports that give you a great starting point for exploring and analyzing your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] data.

[//]: # (Please excuse if this edit is wrong. I assumed this conversation is really between a customer and your company's social profile, which can consist of several team members. If that's wrong, can you explain a bit what that last sentence means?)
### Conversation view for private messages and Twitter replies 
 Starting with this update, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] shows you any conversation that involves private messages (on [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)]) or [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] replies between a customer and one of your social profiles. The back and forth conversation between two authors shows the latest post at the top along with the two authors, including the one who belongs to your team and answered as your social profile. This view also shows all the team members who answered as that social profile.

## [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] 2017 update 1.2 
 
### Get insights with the Social Selling Assistant 
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] Social Selling Assistant introduces Get Insights, a new recommendation type you can use to get recommendations for posts about your customers, competitors, and other topics of interest so you can stay on top of the latest developments.

### Engagement history contains user information 
 The engagement action history now shows the name and profile picture of the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] user who performed the action in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)].

### Sell more with the Social Selling Assistant 
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] introduces the Social Selling Assistant to empower your salespeople to sell more by leveraging social media. With this application, your salespeople get personalized and smart recommendations for posts to share on their social networks to increase their social presence, gain trust from their followers, and generate more leads. 
 
 [//]: # (@Michael, is there a product name token you can use for Dynamics 365 for Sales here?)
 You can access the Social Selling Assistant from within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] and install it from Microsoft AppSource into your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for Sales application. The AppSource app adds a new dashboard that contains the Social Selling Assistant. Salespeople can access this dashboard from the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] web client, and from [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_tablets](../includes/pn-dyn-365-tablets.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_phones](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)] is currently not supported.

Your [!INCLUDE[pn_LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] social profile will be available for the post action **Post Link**. When you share to [!INCLUDE[pn_LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)], you can choose between two visibility options: show the post to everyone on [!INCLUDE[pn_LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] or to your network only.

# What&#39;s new in Microsoft Social Engagement
Welcome to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]. Here's a list of features we added recently. 
 
 If you’re new to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], see [Get started with Social Engagement](../social-engagement/get-started.md). 
 
 For a detailed list of improvements and bug fixes for the latest release, see our [blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/tag/social-engagement-kb-articles/). 
 
 For important, late-breaking information and a list of known issues, see the [Microsoft Social Engagement Readme](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=393612). 
 
## Microsoft Social Engagement 2017 Update 1.4 
 
### Engagement Analytics with Power BI 
 We are extending our recently introduced [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_power_bi](../includes/pn-microsoft-power-bi.md)] content pack for [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] with the new Engagement Analytics report; adding to the Engagement Performance and Team Performance reports previously released. The Engagement Analytics report provides you additional insights regarding your engagement on social media with metrics based on location, sentiment, tags and authors. The data model is also enhanced to include these additional dimensions giving you more power to explore and analyze your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] data. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Get the Microsoft Social Engagement content pack for Power BI](../social-engagement/get-content-pack-for-power-bi.md) 
 
### Improved usability in Social Selling Assistant 
 The Social Selling Assistant experience received a first polishing pass: The **Done** button is now next to all other actions at the bottom of the card. 
 
 We adapted the forms in the Social Selling Assistant configuration and [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] Settings page **User Preferences** to industry standards. When editing those forms the **Save** and **Cancel** buttons are now the bottom of the input form. Additionally, the main navigation now contains a direct link to the Post view in Analytics, filtered for private messages, so you can get to your customers messages in a single click.

## Microsoft Social Engagement 2017 Update 1.3 
 
### Power BI content pack for Social Engagement 
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] introduces the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_power_bi](../includes/pn-microsoft-power-bi.md)] content pack to get insights about your engagement and team performance on social media. This content pack is designed specifically for community managers, providing performance metrics for engagement actions taken from within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. Track metrics, such as number of actions taken and average response times, and get visibility into the performance of each member of your team. [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi](../includes/pn-power-bi.md)] automatically creates the dashboard and reports that give you a great starting point for exploring and analyzing your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] data.

### Conversation view for private messages and Twitter replies 
 Starting with this update, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] shows you any conversation that involves private messages ([!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)]) and [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] replies of one of your social profiles. It displays the back and forth between two authors sorted by showing the latest post first. At the top you will see the two authors, including the one that belongs to your team. It also shows the team members who answered as that social profile. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [See the conversations with an author](../social-engagement/posts-conversations.md#conversationView) 
 
## Microsoft Social Engagement 2017 Update 1.2 
 
### Get insights with Social Selling Assistant 
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] Social Selling Assistant introduces a new recommendation type: Get Insights. This adds to the existing recommendations for sharing content. This new type provides recommendations for posts about your customers, competitors, and other topics of interest, so you can stay on top of the latest developments. With this addition, you can now get a separate set of recommendations for sharing content and insights.

### Engagement history contains user information 
 The engagement action history now shows the name and profile picture of the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] user who performed the action in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Publish and react to posts](../social-engagement/publish-react-posts.md) 
 
## Microsoft Social Engagement 2017 Update 1.1 
 
### Sell more with Social Selling Assistant 
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] introduces Social Selling Assistant, to empower your salespeople to sell more by leveraging social media. With this application, your salespeople get personalized and smart recommendations to share on their social networks to enable them increase their social presence, gain trust from their followers, and generate more leads. 
 
 You can access Social Selling Assistant from within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] and install it from Microsoft AppSource into your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for Sales application. The AppSource app adds a new dashboard that contains the Social Selling Assistant. Salespeople can access this dashboard from the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] web client, as well as from [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_tablets](../includes/pn-dyn-365-tablets.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_phones](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)] is currently not supported. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Empower your salespeople with the Social Selling Assistant](../social-engagement/social-selling-assistant-overview.md) 
 
### User interface is now available in Japanese and Chinese (traditional) 
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] introduces the user interface in Japanese and Chinese (traditional) languages. Users can change the language of the user interface under **Settings** > **Personal Settings** > **Your Preferences**. The localization of the user interface also includes the respective calendars for Japanese and Chinese (traditional) languages. 
 
### Share a post to LinkedIn 
 With this release you can add your personal [!INCLUDE[pn_LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] account as a social profile. With it you can share any public post in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] to your professional network on [!INCLUDE[pn_LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)]. Your [!INCLUDE[pn_LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] social profile will be available for the post action **Post Link**. When you share to [!INCLUDE[pn_LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)], you can choose between two visibility options: show the post to everyone on [!INCLUDE[pn_LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] or to your network only. This post action is available across all [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] services, including the newly released Social Selling Assistant. For you to start sharing, go to **Settings** > **Social Profiles**, and then click the **Add Profile** button, select **LinkedIn Profile**, and follow the steps. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage social profiles](../social-engagement/manage-social-profiles.md) 
 
## Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 Update 1.12 
 
### Tag authors with custom tags 
 You can now tag any author with custom tags and filter by these tags. This means you can now segment authors in any of our apps by using filtering. For example, create a stream for posts from your group of "brand advocates", or use Analytics to see how the tone of "industry leads" authors changed. 
 
 To tag an author, open the author details view (now available for any source), and then click the **Add** button. This is similar to how you tag posts. You can see author tags in post details, and in posts list as icons. 
 
 Note that it will take some time for these changes to author tags to appear in all posts. New posts from authors will get author tags directly when the posts are acquired. Author details for [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] authors will continue to show additional details. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Get details on specific authors](../social-engagement/author-details.md) 
 
### Increase engagement by using Disqus 
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] introduces [!INCLUDE[tn_disqus](../includes/tn-disqus.md)] as an additional data source. [!INCLUDE[tn_disqus](../includes/tn-disqus.md)] is used by millions of websites, including blogs and news sites, to allow comments and discussions by users on relevant topics. [!INCLUDE[tn_disqus](../includes/tn-disqus.md)] is available as a self-service source in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] and allows users to gather relevant data by defining keyword search topics. 
 
### Secure your integration of Microsoft Dynamics 365 with Social Engagement 
 To ensure that only the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] domains you own can make requests to your data in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], you now need to explicitly add your [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_365](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365.md)] domains as allowed domains in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]. If you are a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrator, you can do this by going to **Settings** > **Allowed Domains**. Add only your owned [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_365](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365.md)] domains as allowed domains to enable communication with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. 
 
> [!NOTE]
> With [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] 2016 Update 1.12, all *.dynamics.com domains are no longer allowed to communicate with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] by default. 
 
## Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 Update 1.11 
 
### [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] update 
 We recently launched the new [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] suite of applications. As part of this, you will now see the new [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] brand name referenced throughout the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] application. Previous references to Dynamics CRM are now replaced with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. Note that this does not affect any of your existing connections or integration functionality with Dynamics CRM instances. 
 
### New Stats panel for automation rules 
 For better visibility into the execution of your automation rules, we've added a new Stats panel. You can now see execution statistics for the last seven days to ensure the rules are working within your expectations. The panel shows the volume of posts the rules were executed on, organized by the specific actions that were taken. You can see stats across all your rules or for a specific rule. 
 
### Display Office 365 profile photos in<br /> [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] 
 Identifying users is now easier with the ability to see their profile photos in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]. We acquire user profile photos from [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] and display them everywhere in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] a user profile photo is shown, including on the top navigation bar and other places like the assignee on a social post, or the users a social profile is shared with. 
 
 We've added a quick link to help you upload or edit your profile photo . To find this quick link, go to your [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] profile page from the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] navigation bar, or to **Your Preferences** in **Personal Settings**. 
 
> [!NOTE]
> Photos uploaded in [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] may not show up right away in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)], and you may need to refresh your browser or sign in again to see them . 
 
### Updated discovery of<br /> [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-dyn-365-online.md)] instances to work across all of our data center locations 
 When you add a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] connection in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)], you no longer need to manually select the data center location of your [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-dyn-365-online.md)] instance. 
 
 The new **Check Instances** button will automatically search and display all of your [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-dyn-365-online.md)] instances across all data center locations. You can then select the specific instance to connect [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] to. 
 
### Display linked images and videos in tweets in<br /> [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] 
 Images and videos that are uploaded on [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] and linked in tweets through t.co links are now shown in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)], in the details of a post in the post lists. This update improves the workflow by letting users see linked images and videos right away, without leaving [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]. 
 
## Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 Update 1.10 
 
### [!INCLUDE[tn_reddit](../includes/tn-reddit.md)] as a new source 
 We've added [!INCLUDE[tn_reddit](../includes/tn-reddit.md)] as a new source in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]. Set up or edit keyword rules, and then choose [!INCLUDE[tn_reddit](../includes/tn-reddit.md)] as an additional search channel. You'll see [!INCLUDE[tn_reddit](../includes/tn-reddit.md)] posts and comments in a threaded view, and in the analytics widgets you already use. [!INCLUDE[tn_reddit](../includes/tn-reddit.md)] doesn't contain any location information. 
 
### Share posts within Microsoft Social Engagement through a link 
 As you work with posts, you can now generate internal links to easily share posts with other [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] users in your organization. To generate a link for a post, click the **Copy Internal URL** button in the post details. 
 
### Refresh Dynamics 365 connections to update entity metadata 
 We recently introduced the ability to update metadata in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] by refreshing a Dynamics 365 connection. We've now extended this to also refresh Dynamics 365 entity metadata on the Dynamics 365 connection. When you refresh a connection, you'll be notified if any Dynamics 365 entities or entity attributes are no longer available, and then they'll be automatically removed from the Dynamics 365 connection. 
 
## Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 Update 1.9 
 
### New listening languages 
 You can now search four new languages in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, and Slovenian are now available for keyword search rules, analytics filters, filter sets, and global settings for search languages and search topic defaults. 
 
### Active posts in Analytics 
 When working with posts in Analytics, you'll now see that the posts you've recently opened are highlighted. When you use the up and down arrows in the top right corner of the post details view, the post list will adjust to the position of the post you’re looking at. This also happens in streams when you're navigating through post details. When you're ready to go back to the post list, the last post you have opened will be at the top of your post list. 
 
### Refresh<br /> [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] connection metadata 
 We're introducing a Refresh button to manually refresh [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] metadata in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. When you create a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] connection, Social Engagement retrieves and stores the metadata, such as [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] version, entities, and entity properties. Any changes to the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance that result in changes to the metadata are not automatically updated in Social Engagement. Use the Refresh button to trigger an update of the metadata and keep your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] connection information in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] up to date. 
 
 For your reference, the Last Updated On date on the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] connection shows when the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] metadata in Social Engagement was last updated. 
 
## Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 Update 1.8 
 
### Simplified editing for keyword-based search rules 
 We have improved the workflow to enter keywords, inclusions, and exclusions for keyword-based search rules in search setup. Words you enter will be displayed as individual items, which allows easier deletion and editing of search rules as well as better readability. Entering a comma or pressing the Enter key will transform the keyword into an easily-removable item. Every separated item acts as an OR operator, which was formerly represented as a comma (,). 
 
 To work with this feature, go to Search Setup, and then create a new Keywords rule or edit and existing one. 
 
### Set a Label action for automation rules 
 Automation rules now let you set a label on posts based on the defined filter criteria. This allows you to automatically triage incoming social posts by setting appropriate labels on them. 
 
 To work with this feature, go to **Settings** > **Automation Rules**, and then create a new rule or edit an existing one. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set a label](../social-engagement/automation-rules.md#set_label) 
 
### Manage search topic ownership 
 We introduced the ability to change the owner of a search topic, so you can ensure every search topic is owned by the appropriate user in your organization. Users with the Power Analyst role can only edit owned search topics. This means you can empower these users by giving them ownership of search topics they manage. You must be an Administrator to change search topic owners. For reference, see the Understand user roles help topic. 
 
 To change the owner of a search topic, go to that search topic in Search Setup, and then edit the owner. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Understand user roles](../social-engagement/user-roles.md), [Create or delete a search topic](../social-engagement/create-delete-search-topic.md) 
 
### Include or exclude groups from the Assignee filter 
 We have extended the filtering capability for the Assignee filter by letting you specify whether to include Office 365 Groups for Dynamics 365. When you filter on a post assigned to a user, you can now specify whether you want to include posts assigned to any groups that the user is a member of. Previously we included posts assigned to groups a user is a member of along with posts directly assigned to that user. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Assignee](../social-engagement/understand-filters.md#assignee_filter) 
 
### Multiple search rule creation for Instagram, custom sources, and private messages 
 To quickly create search topics with several rules, you can now create multiple rules for [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts, custom sources, and private messages at the same time. You'll be able to create multiple rules at once for those source types, similar to [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] profiles and [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages. The selected profiles will be saved as individual rules under the selected search topic. 
 
 To work with this feature, go to Search Setup, create a new [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)], custom sources, or private messages rule, and then add multiple rules. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Add rules to a search topic](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md) 
 
### Improved UI for filters 
 Filters are now easier to view and use. When you open the filter editor, you'll see that active filters are now bold, collapsed. and show the number of active filters, so you can easily see all of your filters. We also reduced the need to manually scroll when you open filter dimensions. In Analytics you can now conveniently view and open a specific active filter by clicking it at the top of the Analytics page. 
 
## Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 Update 1.7 
 
### Introducing Instagram as a new source in Social Engagement 
 [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] is now available as a source in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], adding a way to engage on highly-relevant pictures and short videos from millions of posts published every day. 
 
 To gather posts that mention a specific hashtag, you can create keyword search rules for #hashtags on [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] to find public posts on [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] that contain that hashtag. 
 
 To follow all posts of important [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] accounts (for example, a competitor’s brand account), you can set up [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] account rules to gather all posts from a specific [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] account. 
 
 To acquire data from [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)], you'll need to add at least one [!INCLUDE[tn_instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] profile to your social profiles in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], and then allow data acquisition for that profile. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Add a keywords rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#addKeywordsRule), [Add an Instagram rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#instagram_rule), [Manage access tokens](../social-engagement/manage-access-tokens.md) 
 
### Link to Dynamics 365 is now available for Professional licenses 
 We’re excited to announce that all customers using [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] in combination with [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] can now create [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] entities from a post in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. Users with a Professional license can now link a post to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] and trigger a workflow in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. While users with a [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] Professional license now can create new records in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] from single posts, the automated record creation using automation rules continues to be available for Enterprise licenses only. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Link posts from Social Engagement to Dynamics 365](../social-engagement/link-posts-to-dynamics-365.md), [Integrate Social Engagement with Office 365](../social-engagement/manage-licenses.md) 
 
### New and faster acquisition of posts from Facebook pages 
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] has significantly improved the data freshness of posts and comments from [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages. To start using the new data acquisition, you need to add at least one [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] acquisition profile to the social profiles in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. Authenticated [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] acquisition profiles generate a User Access token on [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)]. Tokens authenticated for data acquisition usually have a lifetime of about 60 days, due to [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)]'s requirements. Administrators and profile owners will receive email notifications when a profile is about to expire. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage social profiles](../social-engagement/manage-social-profiles.md), [Manage access tokens](../social-engagement/manage-access-tokens.md), [Check the health state of your social profiles](../social-engagement/social-profiles-health-state.md) 
 
### Multi-creation of search rules and filtering on search 
 To improve the experience when you set up new search rules, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] now lets you set up multiple [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] search rules and [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages rules at one time. Create a new [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] rule, and then search for the [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] pages or [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] profiles you want to add under the current search topic. 
 
 To quickly find search topics or search rules that contain a specific word or phrase, you can now apply a filter in the Category and Search Topics pane. Start typing the string that you're looking for and see all topics or rules matching what you type. Additionally, you can filter for languages and sources in the search topic configuration and search for custom sources on the custom sources tab. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Add rules to a search topic](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md), [Add a Twitter rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#addTwitterRule), [Add a Facebook pages rule](../social-engagement/add-rules-search-topic.md#addFacebookRule) 
 
### Manage custom tags 
 Some tags may become obsolete over time, or you might want to rename them. Maintain your custom tags and let your users work with relevant items. Administrators can now rename custom tags and delete them if they aren’t needed anymore. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Work with tags](../social-engagement/tags.md) 
 
### Review the quality of auto tags 
 Having insights about the quality and history of the learning models for auto tags and intentions helps you efficiently manage and optimize the auto tags feature. In Settings, on the Auto Tags page, you'll now find information about the quality of the machine learning model for each auto tag. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Work with tags](../social-engagement/tags.md) 
 
### Include or exclude the Label filter 
 You can now build streams in Social Center that cover a variety of workflows by using the updated **Label** filter. The label filter now lets you choose if you want the see posts that have the selected label assigned, or if you want to explicitly see posts that don’t have the selected label assigned. 
 
 For example, you could work with labels like “Closed” or “Case resolved” and filter out those labels in a stream that shows posts assigned to a group of users, so they work on the posts that still require action.

### Automatically assign posts to a user or a group by using automation rules 
 Further extending the capabilities for automated triage of newly-found posts, automation rules now provide the **Assign-to** action. Based on the filters you define, posts are automatically assigned to a user or a group. 
 
 For example, you can assign posts with purchase intentions to your sales team for follow-up. Or, you can assign posts with negative sentiment that mention your company’s service or product to your customer service team. 
 
 To quickly check the number of posts that are processed by an automation rule, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] now shows how many posts might match your filters. When you define the filters, you'll see how many posts previously matched the selected filters in your default time frame, so you can see if that’s within your expectations. Additionally, the actions for each automation rule are now displayed in a list so you can easily edit them.

### Direct messages and private messages now support up to 10,000 characters 
 Direct messages on [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] and private messages on [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] now support up to 10,000 characters per message and let you write longer replies to your audience. You'll be notified if you're about to reach the character limit.

### Details for Twitter posts now show threads for replies and retweets 
 To help you better understand the impact or the context of a post, the detailed view of a [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] post now shows replies and retweets as separate threads. Replies are now related to the posts they reply to, rather than being treated as individual posts.

### New options to handle posts that no longer match a stream’s data set 
 In Social Center, streams now let you choose how to handle posts that no longer match a stream's data set. You can either let the stream automatically hide these posts, or you can choose to be notified in the stream before a post is hidden. Not only does this let you work more efficiently when you triage posts, it also lets you work with posts faster.

### Updated Help & Training Center 
 As tons of great features were added to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] in recent releases, we expanded the footprint of our help content. To get you to the right information quickly, we refined the [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] Help & Training Center page. Check back regularly—we keep refreshing the content as new features are released.

## Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 Update 1.6 
 
### Work more efficiently in streams and post lists 
 Increase your productivity and work smoothly with posts. Streams and post lists now let you quickly skip to the next post as you review post details. Click the Previous/Next arrows to quickly move between posts. And [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] now buffers all actions you apply to a post, saving you valuable time by queuing actions rather than having to complete every action before you can apply the next one. 
 
### Introducing smart data sets 
 Customers now have the convenience of working with smart data sets — data sets that only display applicable filters. Smart data sets ensure that customers will always configure valid data sets. A notification will appear if you're using a filter that is not supported by an interaction area.

## Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 Update 1.5 
 
### Introducing auto tags and adaptive learning on tags 
 You can now enable adaptive learning on your custom tags by adding them to your list of auto tags. [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] applies adaptive machine learning on these tags to predict tags for new incoming posts. This allows the system to learn from users' edits on tags and the tagging of posts 
 
 Custom tags use text analytics and [!INCLUDE[pn_Azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] machine learning techniques to learn patterns from posts manually tagged by users. As more labeled data becomes available, the service can continually learn and improve quality. Labeled data includes tags that are added by the user manually, tags that are added by the system and confirmed by the user, or tags that are added by the system and removed by the user. New, incoming (unlabeled) posts can be scored automatically by the service and analyzed throughout [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. Auto scoring quality can be monitored in the corresponding Settings page. 
 
 The feature will be rolled out gradually for a smooth transition. No action is required on your part. You'll find the new page in **Settings > Global Settings > Auto Tags** when the feature is available.

### Introducing Chinese and Japanese sentiment detection 
 [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] now includes sentiment calculation for Chinese and Japanese in addition to the already available languages. Understand at a glance how the perception of your audience is toward the terms you search for. For more information about the languages that Social Engagement is translated into and sentiment analysis, see [Microsoft Social Engagement Translation Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=391086), [Adaptive learning based on changes to organization’s sentiment values](../social-engagement/adaptive-learning.md "Adaptive learning based on changes to organization’s sentiment values"). 
 
### Extended source coverage: Blogs 
 We have extended the current coverage of the Blogs source. The extended source is automatically included if you set up a new search topic with a keyword rule. To avoid an unintentional surpassing of your monthly post quota, your existing search topics will continue to acquire posts with the previous source coverage. If you want to update existing search topics to include the extended coverage of the Blogs source, you can edit your existing keyword search rules, for example by adding a comma (,) and save the edited rule.

### Open linked social posts with the interactive experience in Dynamics 365 
 [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] recently introduced the new [interactive service hub](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=690167)that offers a different user experience from the web client. For [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] entities that are enabled for interactive experience, we now automatically take you to the interactive service hub when you open a record on a social post that is linked to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] entities not enabled for interactive experience will continue to be opened in the web client. 
 
### Engage with social profiles 
 The social profiles page is redesigned in preparation for future functionality changes. You can easily add tokens to interact with posts and view the health state of your tokens. 
 
 [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage access tokens](../social-engagement/manage-access-tokens.md "Manage access tokens") 
 
### Fewer pop-ups when linking posts to Dynamics 365 (online) 
 The authentication mechanism has changed for linking a social post to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] from client-side to server-side. With this change you will no longer see authentication pop-ups when linking a post or viewing a linked post in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. 
 
 However, you may still see pop-ups when you link or view a post if you have a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance that is older than the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] Online 2016 update, is located in the North America 2 datacenter, or is on-premises. 
 
 The feature will be rolled out gradually for a smooth transition. No action is required on your part.

## Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 Update 1.4 
 
### Introducing custom tags 
 With our last release, we introduced intention tags—a set of predefined tags that are automatically added to posts based on author intent. We're extending the capabilities of the tags feature with custom tags. In addition to intention tags, you can now manually add one or more custom tags to posts. Custom tags allow you to freely choose the tag names and the posts you want to add them to. Tags come in very handy when you want to provide additional context to posts, highlight important announcements, build triage queues, and enable a more detailed structuring of your data set. You can also filter posts by custom tags to narrow your analysis, or define streams based on them. 
 
 The **Tags** widget was also updated to reflect the number of posts with custom tags. Check it out on **Analytics > Conversations** and understand at a glance how the tags are distributed in your data set.

### New source: Forums 
 Forums are digital discussion boards on the Internet where people discuss all kinds of topics. Understanding your audience requires listening to what is on their minds. Great ideas often arise from lively discussions, and forums give you a great way to reach them and find out what people think about topics that matter to your business. 
 
 Find out what customers are saying on a variety of public Internet forums. [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] offers forums as a new source so you can better understand the topics and issues you come across in forum discussions. Keyword searches on forums can help you gather relevant posts for your search topics. To start using this new source, either set up a new search topic or edit an existing search topic and include **Forums** in the source of your keyword rule. 
 
 Some forums provide location data, so their posts can show as part of the **Location Insights** widget, or on an activity map. Check out your location data on **Analytics > Locations** to find out where the authors of the forum posts are located.

### Stream social data to Microsoft Azure Event Hubs 
 Using [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_azure_event_hubs](../includes/pn-microsoft-azure-event-hubs.md)]—a highly scalable publish-subscribe event ingestor that handles millions of events per second—you can transform and store social data for further processing. Specify an automation rule in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] and stream all posts that match this rule as events to a connected event hub. Once you have the data in the event hub, you can access it from any application that you connect to your event hub. 
 
 When [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] sends a social post as an event to [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_event_hubs](../includes/pn-azure-event-hubs.md)], a JSON payload is submitted to the connected event hub. Along with the default properties of the post, you can define custom key-value pairs to add when you set up the automation rule for a given data set to create custom analytics scenarios and advanced reporting capabilities.

### React to a public conversation with a private message 
 Conversations on [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] usually start on public timelines of individual users. Especially with support requests, additional information is often required (for example a billing number, or a real name confirmation). This additional information usually isn’t intended for the public and needs to be shared in a private way. [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] now lets you add a link to start a private conversation to any public reply on [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)]. This lets you turn any public conversation into a private one, without losing the context.

## Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 Update 1.3 
 
### Understand an author's intent using intention analysis 
 To help increase team efficiency for sales and service organizations, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] automatically detects intentions in English social posts on [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] and [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)]. Intention tags are applied to acquired posts and are analyzed by a machine-learning based algorithm to detect author’s intentions. Posts that are picked up by a search topic are scored against the algorithm and if applicable, marked with the intentions identified. In addition to the automated tagging, you can manually add tags or remove tags from posts. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Work with tags](../social-engagement/tags.md "Work with tags") 
 
 To analyze the intentions in the user interface, we introduced the Intentions widget. It displays a distribution of the intention tags in your current data set. The metrics include the total number of posts with intention tags, the number of posts per intention tag, and the trend per intention tag. Analyzing the intentions over a data set gives you quick insights into what's on the top of your audience's mind. At a glance, you can find out if there are more purchase intents after you launched a marketing campaign and get an additional indicator of its success. Or, you can see if there are major issues bubbling up due to an increased volume of posts with support requests or complaints. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Gain insights from public conversations](../social-engagement/analytics-conversations.md "Gain insights from public conversations") 
 
### Route posts using automation rules 
 Automatically link posts matching your filter criteria to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] entities such as cases and leads. Combine this with intention analysis and you can setup an automated triage process. For example, customer issues on social media can be automatically identified and routed to your service department as cases. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Route posts using automation rules](../social-engagement/automation-rules.md "Route posts using automation rules") 
 
### Sentiment analysis for the Arabic language 
 The updated sentiment algorithm provides you with the capability to perform sentiment analysis for posts in Arabic. Additionally, post content in Arabic, Hebrew, or Urdu now displays with a right-to-left alignment in the post list and in post details. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Microsoft Social Engagement Translation Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=391086), [Adaptive learning based on changes to organization’s sentiment values](../social-engagement/adaptive-learning.md) 
 
### Share a link from a post found in Social Engagement 
 When you find a post in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], be it on a stream in Social Center, or in the post list in Analytics, you can share this post to your peers with a few clicks. Simply click the **Post Link** button and add some text to your post. Choose the social profile to post to, and you’re done. Give it a try.

### Improvements to Link-to-Dynamics 365 user experience 
 We introduced improvements when requesting information from the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] discovery service and updated the error messages when there's an issue with the connection to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. Authentication requests are now handled more smoothly when you link a post from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_op_edition](../includes/pn-crm-op-edition.md)].

You can now not only check how your search topics are configured and what type of rules they contain, but also create searches or edit them while you’re on the go. For more information about how to set up searches, see [Set up searches to listen to social media conversations](../social-engagement/set-up-searches.md). 
 
### Tweaks to user experience 
 When you review the organization of your search topics in the category list, the search rules in a search topic are now represented with the corresponding icons. Additionally, we refined the post list layout. The post list in Analytics and the wide view of streams now separate information about the author from the post's content for improved readability. 
 
### New and improved functionality on widgets 
 The Sources widget now comes with a full-screen view to show the entire list of sources and their number of posts. The Sources History widget now comes with improved highlighting of data points, so you can easily see the values of the data. Authors by Source not only shows the five most active sources, but also summarizes how many authors posted in the other sources. 
 
### New videos added 
 We’ve added the following new videos to the collection: [3 intelligent ways to engage your customers in Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 (3:00)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=723351) and [New features in Microsoft Social Engagement 2016 (4:19)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=723350).

### Streams showing posts from the past 14 days 
 To ensure streams show only the most recent information for more effective and relevant engagement, we have limited them to show only posts from the past 14 days. You can always see earlier posts in Analytics, which you can now get to directly from Social Center.

### Adaptive learning for an organization’s sentiment calculations 
 The sentiment algorithm can now learn from edits to sentiment values. You can turn on the adaptive learning by going to **Settings** > **Global Settings** > **Sentiment**, and then turn it off at any time when you’re satisfied with the quality level of your sentiment.

### Listen, analyze, and engage on social posts 
 With the redesigned user interface, which puts the information up front, it’s easier than ever to navigate and find the posts that matter to you, so you can analyze and take action on them. You can now find the posts that matter to you, analyze them, and take action on those posts in a single application. To reflect the addition of Social Center functionality, the product name has changed to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)]. 
 
### Stay connected with your audience using Social Center 
 Engage with your audience on [!INCLUDE[tn_facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] and [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)], directly from within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)].

### Identify significant phrases in social posts 
 Content analytics are key to understanding what people are talking about on social media. We’re introducing the new Conversations page in Analytics to provide deep insights into the content of the social conversations. We extract important phrases from all social posts in your data set, not just a sample, to provide a clear view into what’s on the minds of your customers and stakeholders on social media.

Additionally, you can create and manage custom categories to organize search topics according to your requirements.

The quota feedback calculation on the estimated number of results now takes the selected sources and search languages into account. More information: [Set up searches to listen to social media conversations](../social-engagement/set-up-searches.md).

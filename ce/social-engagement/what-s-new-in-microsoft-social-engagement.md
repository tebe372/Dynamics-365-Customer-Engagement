## Microsoft Social Engagement 2017 Update 1.6

### Listening on YouTube channels

Social Engagement is now capable of listening video posts and comments on YouTube channels. Users with at least a Power Analyst configuration role can create YouTube rules under any search topic and add YouTube channels to gather all posts and comments from.

Keyword-based searches on the video source continue to reside under the Keywords rule.

### Engagement on YouTube

Get in touch with your audience on YouTube directly from within Social Engagement. Users with at least a Responder interaction role can now like and reply to videos on YouTube.

You'll need to add a social profile for YouTube under Settings > Social Profiles, or get a YouTube profile shared with you before you can interact on this source.




## Microsoft Social Engagement 2017 Update 1.5

### Service and product improvements

Although there are no new features to announce this month, we've been working on proactively addressing service and product improvements with the current release.

For user-facing changes we've addressed, please see [the detailed blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2017/06/09/whats-new-in-microsoft-social-engagement-2017-update-1-5/).

Additionally, we continued our ongoing investment to make [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] more accessible. With the current release, Social Selling Assistant within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] supports keyboard navigation as well as screenreaders on mobile and desktop devices.

## Microsoft Social Engagement 2017 Update 1.4 
 
### Engagement Analytics with Power BI 
 We are extending our recently introduced [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_power_bi](../includes/pn-microsoft-power-bi.md)] content pack for [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] with the new Engagement Analytics report; adding to the Engagement Performance and Team Performance reports previously released. The Engagement Analytics report provides you additional insights regarding your engagement on social media with metrics based on location, sentiment, tags and authors. The data model is also enhanced to include these additional dimensions giving you more power to explore and analyze your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] data.

### Improved usability in Social Selling Assistant 
 The Social Selling Assistant experience received a first polishing pass: The **Done** button is now next to all other actions at the bottom of the card. 
 
 We adapted the forms in the Social Selling Assistant configuration and [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] Settings page **User Preferences** to industry standards. When editing those forms the **Save** and **Cancel** buttons are now the bottom of the input form. Additionally, the main navigation now contains a direct link to the Post view in Analytics, filtered for private messages, so you can get to your customers messages in a single click.

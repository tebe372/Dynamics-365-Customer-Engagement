# Integrate Microsoft Social Engagement with Dynamics 365
For social [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] scenarios, you can integrate [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] with the Dynamics product family.  Integrating [!INCLUDE[pn_social_insights](../includes/pn-social-insights.md)] from [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_marketingpilot](../includes/pn-marketingpilot.md)] helps businesses analyze social media data to spot emerging trends in people’s comments, whether they’re positive, negative, or neutral. You can drill down into the data and see exactly what people said. By consolidating the details from [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_marketing](../includes/pn-dynamics-marketing.md)], you can find out what you’re doing right, and address potential issues before bigger problems arise.  
  
 When you look for detailed analysis of your data, usually, you work directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)].  
  
## Connect with Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online)  
 Review the buzz or the sentiment for your searches directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] by connecting your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance with a [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] solution.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You need to have a System Administrator security role or equivalent permissions in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  
  
 As an administrator, you configure the connection to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] and add the [!INCLUDE[pn_social_insights](../includes/pn-social-insights.md)] controls to the entity forms and system dashboards. After you have connected [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], you can use the [Social Insights controls](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526316) on [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] forms and dashboard editors to specify the social data that you want to see and in the form in which you want this data presented.

## Set up search topics from within Dynamics 365  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Search topics are usually created by Administrators or Power Analysts directly in the settings of [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)]. However, to get up and running quickly, users with Administrator or Power Analyst user roles in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] can set up searches from within [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
 To have the full set of options for creating a search topic available, it’s a good idea to work directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)].

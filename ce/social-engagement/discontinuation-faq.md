# Changes coming for Microsoft Social Engagement

## Overview

Effective January 16, 2019, Microsoft will no longer offer Microsoft Social Engagement as part of the Dynamics 365 subscription for new customers. Current Dynamics 365 customers are entitled to continue using the Microsoft Social Engagement service for the remainder the contract or until the discontinuation of service on January 16, 2020, whichever is sooner. These changes may require your organization to take advance action prior to the end of your contract, to transition to an alternative solution. 

With the discontinuation of service, we suggest to try [the public preview of Microsoft Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/market-insights/) to help meet your needs. Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights is an application that can help users gain insights and win market share by monitoring external information sources, both social media and trending search terms on the web. Unlike other solutions in the market, this easy to use application provides holistic social and web insights, intelligent sentiment and intent analysis features. This helps businesses know their customers, build their brand, and gain competitive advantage.
Transition offer:

Active customers* whose contracts exceed past the discontinuation date of Microsoft Social Engagement, January 16, 2020, will have the option to opt into using the base package of Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights application for free. The opt in period will begin when AI for Market Insights becomes generally available and allows active customers to use the grandfathering plan until the end of their current contract, or January 16, 2022 whichever is earlier. These active customers must opt in to the grandfather plan before January 16, 2020. 

After the end of their contracts, Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights will be available for customers to purchase at the future market price.
 
*Active customers are those who in the months of either October, November, or December 2018 met the following criteria: 
- At least 1 Monthly Active User logging in AND
- At least 1 Search Topic configured
OR
- Any customer that has paid for additional quota post add-ons
For questions related to transitioning you can contact [MSEeol@microsoft.com](mailto:MSEeol@microsoft.com).  

## General questions

### Why is Microsoft Social Engagement being discontinued?
    
Dynamics 365 will focus more on enabling businesses with complete AI powered social and web insights rather than just with social listening capabilities. Combined capabilities and insights from Microsoft Social Engagement, Bing Search, IE/Edge browser and Dynamics 365 will be offered through [Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/market-insights/). The social and web insights can help marketing, social media and product teams know what their customers and competitors say, seek, and feel.

### What is the Microsoft Social Engagement to Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights transitional experience?

The transition to Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights will be an easy experience for existing MSE customers. When signing in to AI for Market Insights, all the data and configurations from MSE will be migrated to AI for Market Insights. The user interface for AI for Market Insights is subject to change in the future. There may be some additional configurations required to use the new features that will be available only in AI for Market Insights.

- **Brand Reputation**: Use machine learning to tweak sentiment detection in a way thatâ€™s tailored to your organization. Identify, track, and engage with individual influencers and experts on social so you never miss a post from an influencer. Stay up to date on industry trends with a market news email digest.
- **Social Care**: Give service agents the information they need and automate case routing, so they can spend more time delighting customers.  Detect and create alerts based on sentiment and trends to proactively identify service issues.
- **Social Selling**: Empower your sales people to sell more by leveraging social media. Sales teams can gather intelligence, source new leads, and build credibility.  Source high-quality leads by using social to identify and act on buying signals, then create new leads based on social posts.

Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights will focus more on enabling businesses with complete AI-powered social and web insights and will have combined capabilities and insights from Microsoft Social Engagement, Bing Search, IE/Edge browser and the Dynamics 365 platform. Future releases will include more capabilities to deliver web insights based on Bing search and IE/Edge browse activities.

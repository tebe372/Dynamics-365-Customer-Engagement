# Understand the public perception using sentiment analysis
View and understand the sentiments in the social chat related to the posts that are found by your search topics. Using the **Sentiments** page, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] calculates the sentiment value of social posts with natural-language processing and machine learning techniques. From the details displayed on this page, you can understand the positive, negative, or neutral sentiments and also the volume and the sources they come from.  
  
Navigate to this page from **Analytics > Sentiments**.  
  
## See the perception of a post and its sentiment value  
Each post that results from your defined searches is processed by the sentiment algorithm in the original language and annotated with a calculated sentiment value. For more information on the supported languages, you can download the [Microsoft Social Engagement Translation Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=391086).  
  
The sentiment value results in a positive, negative, neutral, or unknown sentiment for a post. Occasionally, the algorithm identifies positive and negative parts of a sentence and still rates the post as neutral. This happens because the amount of a post’s text identified as positive or negative cancel each other out. A post is also classified as neutral if there are no positive or negative statements detected in it. Unknown sentiment value indicates that the post’s language isn’t supported by the sentiment algorithm.  
  
The sentiment values from posts with positive or negative sentiment that match your defined filters are normalized and result in the sentiment index for your search topic.  
  
## See the normalized perception of a data set and its sentiment index  
The sentiment index is normalized to a value between -10 and 10. All your active filters and parameters are taken into account to define the data set that the sentiment index is calculated for.  
  
-   A sentiment index of 10 means that there are no negative posts in your data set.  
  
-   A sentiment index of 0 means that there is an equal amount of positive and negative posts in your data set.  
  
-   A sentiment index of -10 means that there are no positive posts in your data set.  
  
You can calculate the sentiment index with the following formula:  
  
`Sentiment index = (Positive posts – Negative posts)/(Positive posts + Negative posts) * 10`  
  
You’ll find the change in trend next to the sentiment index. [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] compares the sentiment index of previous time frames to the current value of the sentiment index in your time frame.

# See the locations for the posts
View the analysis for geographical location information contained in posts or in authors’ profiles. Using the **Location** page, you can view details such as top locations, top languages, and top location groups.  
  
Go to this page from **Analytics > Location.**  
  
## Types of location data  
In [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)], two types of location data are available:  
  
- **Author location:** Location data that is shared by a user through a profile (for example, on a user’s [!INCLUDE[tn_twitter](../includes/tn-twitter.md)] profile page). Consider this an approximate value because the geographical coordinates are calculated by the system. If no post location is provided by the user, the author location is taken into account, where available.  
  
- **Post location:** Location data that determines from which geographical point (latitude/longitude) a post was published. This can differ greatly between posts from the same author, depending on the applied settings when publishing the post. This is an exact value because geographical coordinates are provided with the post.  
  
Both types of location data are available under the **Location Type** filter when performing analysis. More information: [Get relevant data using filters](use-filters.md)  
  
For some locations, for example the United States, you can choose between two ways of grouping the visualized data. To see how many posts with location data are available in each subregion, apply a filter for post location and select **SUBREGIONS**. To see posts with precise geographical information (post location data) on the map, select **POSTS**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Some posts may have both post and author location. In these cases, that post is counted for the post location metric (and not counted for author location metric).  
  
## Sources that provide location data  
A subset of the available sources that provide location data. Authors need to share their information to see location for sources.

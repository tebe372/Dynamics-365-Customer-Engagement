# Manage the personal data of authors

Most posts in Social Engagement are linked to an author, a user on a social network. With sufficient permissions, you can remove authors from Social Engagement and block all future data acquisition for posts by the removed author. It's critical to understand the implications of deleting all author information by removing an author since this can't be undone and potentially can have a significant impact on data acquisition of your solution. 

## Delete all author information

## Export author information

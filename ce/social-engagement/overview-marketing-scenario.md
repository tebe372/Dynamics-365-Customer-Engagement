## Prerequisites

- You have a [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] license assigned.

- [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] is [set up](../social-engagement/administer-microsoft-social-engagement.md).

- [Search topics are configured](../social-engagement/set-up-searches.md) and data acquisition is up and running. To listen to conversations about your brand, it's important that you create a search topic that gathers relevant posts.

- You have the required [user roles and permissions](../social-engagement/user-roles.md) assigned in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)].

## Brand reputation

To find out how a brand is perceived on social media, after you [set up a search topic](../social-engagement/set-up-searches.md) for it, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] provides [sentiment analysis](../social-engagement/analytics-sentiment.md) capabilities in the original language by using natural language processing and machine learning capabilities.

1. Get an overview of the posts that mention your brand on the [Overview page in Analytics](../social-engagement/analytics-overview.md).

2. Go to **Anayltics** > **Sentiment** to get insights into how people feel about your brand and find out who your brand advocates are.

3. See which topics are being discussed around your brand on the [Conversation page in Analytics](../social-enagement/analytics-conversations.md).

## Campaign performance

Campaigns on social media often revolve around a specific term, for example a hashtag. If you set up a search topic for this term, [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] helps you understand at a glance how your campaign is performing.

1. Get started analyzing the conversations about your campaign on the [Conversation page in Analytics](../social-enagement/analytics-conversations.md).

2. [Create an activity map](../social-enagement/activity-maps.md) to see newly found posts on a map with location data in real time.

3. Review the sentiment of posts that mention your brand on the [Sentiment page in Analytics](../social-engagement/analytics-sentiment.md).

## Find leads for the sales team

Identify potential leads on social media and let your sales team know about them. [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)] lets you create new leads in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] directly from a post within [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)].

1. Use [intention analysis](../social-engagement/tags.md#how-intention-analysis-works) to look for posts that express a purchase intent.

2. [Link these posts to Dynamics 365](../social-engagement/create-dynamics-365-records-from-social-post.md) to create a new lead record.

3. Automate this workflow by using an [automation rule](../social-engagement/automation-rules.md) for every post tagged with **Purchase Intention**.

## Share your content on social media

Have you launched or refreshed a product or service? Let your marketing team share it with the world. Publish posts and engage with your communities on social media with [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-netbreeze-short.md)].

1. [Add social profiles](../social-engagement/manage-social-profiles.md) and [share](../social-engagement/manage-social-profiles.md#let-other-users-work-with-your-social-profile) them with your team.

2. [Publish](../social-engagement/publish-react-posts.md) your news to social networks to spread the word about your products and services.

3. Work with [Office 365 groups](../social-engagement/office-365-groups-social-engagement.md) to share social profiles or streams with a larger team.

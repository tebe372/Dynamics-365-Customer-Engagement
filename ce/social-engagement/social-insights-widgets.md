-	Sentiment
-	Reach
-	Location

## Switch widgets between chart view and table view

Social Insights widgets offer two ways to look at the data. You can switch each widget between a table view for detailed data points and a chart view to understand the data visually.   

By default, widgets are shown in the chart view. To change this default, you can [edit your personal preferences](user-preferences.md) in Social Engagement. 

To switch the view in chart mode, select the **Switch to table view** symbol.

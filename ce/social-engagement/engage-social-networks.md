# FRE: Service - Engage on social networks
Do you want to offer a fast and powerful support to your customers on social channels? This learning path provides a step by step description how you and your team can use [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-netbreeze-long.md)] to solve your customer's requests happening on social media.

## Newly created orgs and orgs without LinkedIn solutions

After June 2019 (build version > 9.1.0.6228), we changed the way the LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration is rolled out to organizations. By default, no LinkedIn solutions are auto-installed anymore. An administrator needs to install the solution package before other users can work with them. 

### To install the Sales Navigator integration

1. In Dynamics 365 Sales, go to **Settings** > **Business Management**.
2. Select **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**.
3. In the new **Installation** tab that opens, select **Continue** to install the required solutions. It takes a few minutes to complete the installation.
4. When the installation is completed, select **Go to Configuration** and follow the steps below to [Enable the default Sales Navigator controls](#enable-the-default-sales-navigator-controls).

After a successful installation, the Solutions page in the Admin Center lists three solutions related to LinkedIn Sales Navigator.

## Enable the default Sales Navigator controls

The following procedure guides administrators to enable default controls for LinkedIn Sales Navigator content. The Sales Navigator controls will appear on Account, Contact, Lead, and Opportunity pages by default. However, you can still customize other forms and entities to show Sales Navigator controls.

1. In Dynamics 365 Sales, go to **Settings** > **Business Management**.

2. Select **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**.
3. Select the **Enable Sales Navigator integration** control.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Enable the Sales Navigator integration](media/sales-navigator-dialog-box.png)
4. Select **Ok** to enable the integration.

## Disable the default Sales Navigator controls

Disabling the integration will stop showing the Sales Navigator controls. 

1. In Dynamics 365 Sales, go to **Settings** > **Business Management**.
2. Select **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**.
3. Select the **Enable Sales Navigator integration** control.
4. Select **Ok** to disable the integration.

## Automatically sync profile images for matched leads

For leads that are matched to a LinkedIn member profile, the system can automatically sync profile pictures from LinkedIn. However, the profile pictures are only stored for 24 hours and sync daily.

1. In Dynamics 365 Sales, go to **Settings** > **Business Management**.
2. Select **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**.
3. Select the **Photo refresh** control.
4. Select **Ok** to activate the sync of profile images.

To enable the profile image sync, you also need to enable **Sales Navigator CRM sync** in the LinkedIn Sales Navigator settings. For more information how to enable CRM sync, see [Integration between Sales Navigator and your CRM](https://www.linkedin.com/help/sales-navigator/answer/82207/integration-between-sales-navigator-and-your-crm-overview).

Please note that only profile pictures for matched leads can sync from LinkedIn.

## Existing orgs that got updated with April 19 features

In the [April 19 release](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/preview-october-2019-updates#when-will-the-2019-release-wave-2-features-be-enabled) we introduced changes to how the Sales Navigator controls are enabled.   
   
Here are a few things to consider if you don't plan to enable the integration. 
   
1. Three solutions related to the LinkedIn integration appear in the **All Solutions** view in **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Solutions**. Although these solutions are pre-installed, the functionality and data transfer between the two systems will be disabled unless you [enable the Sales Navigator controls](#enable-the-default-sales-navigator-controls). Additionally, **CRM Sync** needs to be explicitly enabled on the LinkedIn Sales Navigator Admin Settings. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![List of LinkedIn related solutions](media/solution-list.png)

2. System customizers will see the new LinkedIn controls in Account, Contact, Lead, and Opportunity form editors. However, their default visibility is turned OFF and end users will not be able to see these controls on the forms unless the feature is enabled by a system administrator. Customizers can remove these controls from the pages as they would remove any control in case they find it too distracting.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Visibility settings in tab properties](media/visibility-settings.jpg)

3. While using **Advanced Find**, end users see the new entities introduced by these solutions (InMails, Messages, and PointDrive Presentation Viewed) even if the integration is not enabled. This is the intended behavior and users can ignore these entities if they are not actively using the LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration.

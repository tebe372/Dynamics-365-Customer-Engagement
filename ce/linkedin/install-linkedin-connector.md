# Install [!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)] from AppSource

[!include[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To pull lead data from [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] to [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)], a system administrator needs to install [!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)] from [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850928).
> [!NOTE]
> You can only benefit from this connector when you use [LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/native-advertising/lead-gen-ads) in your campaigns on LinkedIn.

## Prerequisites

* To install, update, or remove the solution, youâ€™ll need global admin permissions in Office 365, and be a system administrator or have a customizer security role in [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].

* The capabilities in this solution require the [!include[December update for Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-online.md)].

* To sync leads from [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] and run campaigns on [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)], you need access to a [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] account that can manage Sponsored Content by using [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Campaign Manager.    
More information: [LinkedIn: Campaign Manager Overview](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/56969), [LinkedIn: Creating an Account for Campaigns](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/topics/8121/8122/5749), [LinkedIn: Adding, Editing, and Removing User Permissions on Advertising Accounts](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/5753)

* We recommend using the latest version of [!include[Edge](../includes/pn-microsoft-edge.md)], [!include[Chrome](../includes/tn-google-chrome.md)], [!include[Firefox](../includes/tn-mozilla-firefox.md)], or [!include[Safari](../includes/tn-apple-safari.md)].

## Download and install the solution from AppSource

First, an administrator needs to install the solution.
[//]: # (, unless you are working with Dynamics 365 for Marketing, Business edition. In that case, you can directly assign security roles to users you want to work with the solution.)

1. Get the app package from [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850928).

2. Sign in to your [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] system admin account.

3. Select **Get** to start installing the solution.

4. Review and accept the disclaimer, required permissions, and service terms to install [!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)] to [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. You need to be a global admin in this Office 365 tenant to authorize S2S inbound. More information about S2S: [MSDN: Build web applications using Server-to-Server (S2S) authentication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt790168.aspx)  
It takes a few minutes to install the solution. To monitor the status of the installation, or update or remove a managed solution, go to the [Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/).
More information: [TechNet: Use the Office 365 admin center to manage your Dynamics 365 (online) subscription in Dynamics 365](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn973004.aspx).

5. In [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)], go to **Settings** > **Customization** > **Solutions** and select **LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms Connector** to see the solution details.

6. The solution creates two new security roles, which you assign to users so they can work with [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen Forms in [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)]. A third role, **LinkedIn Lead Gen S2S Inbound**, is an internal security role used by the solution to sync data.

* **[!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen Forms Administrator**&mdash;Users with this role can configure lead matching strategies, [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] field mapping, and solution settings for [!include[Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)].

* **[!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen Forms Salesperson**&mdash;These users can authorize [!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] user profiles to sync data to [!include[Dynamics 365](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)], and view details about the synced submissions.

Assign these security roles to users you want to provide access to the **[!include[LinkedIn](../includes/pn-linkedin.md)] Lead Gen** menu item in [!include[Dynamics 365 (online)](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. To learn how to assign a security role to users, see [TechNet: Create users and assign Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) security roles](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj191623.aspx#BKMK_AssignSecurity).

More information about installing or removing a solution: [TechNet: Install or remove a preferred solution](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn878909.aspx).

# Synchronize LinkedIn leads
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms enables seamless synchronization of LinkedIn leads to Dynamics 365. LinkedIn enables members to drive leads from Sponsored Content campaigns, based on a variety of calls-to-action. Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms lets campaign managers sync the leads generated in LinkedIn to a Dynamics 365 (online) instance for further nurturing. If a lead is already known in Dynamics 365, their data will be available with the information provided from LinkedIn. Otherwise, a new lead record is created in Dynamics 365.

><b>Important</b></br>
You will need a Dynamics 365 organization with Sales application to preview the new Dynamics 365 connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms.  If you are an existing Dynamics 365 customer, you can use an existing Dynamics 365 organization or setup a new trial or sandbox organization for the preview.  If you are new to Dynamics 365, you need to spin a new trial organization for the preview. You can setup a new trial Dynamics 365 organization from the Free CRM Trial page.

## Quick Start Guide

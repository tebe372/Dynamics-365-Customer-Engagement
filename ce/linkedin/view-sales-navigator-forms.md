# View Sales Navigator controls on forms

To use the LinkedIn Sales Navigator controls, you need be a [LinkedIn Sales Navigator Seat Holder](https://www.linkedin.com/help/sales-navigator/answer/50233/adding-or-removing-seat-holders-in-sales-navigator) and [a customizer needs to add them to the form](add-sales-navigator-controls-forms.md). 

## View controls on the form

1. In Dynamics 365, switch to the Unified Interface app (i.e Sales Hub). 

2. Go to the **Lead** entity and open one of the lead forms.

3. You'll find the controls embedded on the form. If you haven't signed in to LinkedIn, please follow the instructions in the widget.

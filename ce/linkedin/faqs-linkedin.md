# Frequently asked questions

**Why am I unable to sync or load photo of the contacts from LinkedIn to Org Chart?**  

**Answer:** 

Currently, we do not support the sync or load of profile pictures of contacts from LinkedIn to the Org Chart. The Org Chart displays only the pictures that are stored in Dynamics 365 for the contact records. 

**Why am I unable to remove or add fields to a contact through Contact Details side pane after selecting nodes in Org Chart?**  

**Answer:** 

Removing or adding fields from the **Contact Details** pane isn't supported. To learn more, see [Embedded LinkedIn Sales Navigator control](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/live-org-chart#embedded--sales-navigator-control).

**Can I import leads or accounts into Dynamics 365 Sales through CRM Sync?**

**Answer:**

No, you can't import leads or accounts from Sales Navigator to Dynamics 365 Sales through CRM Sync. However, writeback of InMails, Messages, and Smartlink from Sales Navigator to Dynamics 365 Sales is supported. To learn more, see [CRM Sync & Activity Writeback for Dynamics 365](https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/sales-navigator-customer-hub/resources/ms-dynamics-sync-activity-writeback).

**Why am I unable to sync or load photos of my contacts from LinkedIn to the org chart?**  

**Answer:** 

Currently, we don't support syncing or loading contact profile pictures from LinkedIn to the org chart. The org chart displays only the pictures that are stored in Dynamics 365 for contact records.

Removing or adding fields from the **Contact Details** pane isn't supported.

<a name="upgrade-solution-2-to-3-version"> </a>
**Why hasn't my LinkedIn Sales Navigator solution<!--Edit okay? to match other occurrences in this docset.--> been upgraded from version 2.x to 3.x?**
<!--The present tense is a bit confusing here. This question seems to presume that the reader has heard about the upgrade, so it seems the logical question would be "Why wasn't my solution upgraded..." or "Why hasn't my solution been upgraded..."-->
**Answer:**

Because there's no change to functionality in version 3.x, we aren't upgrading. This will have no effect on your current solution (version 2.x).<!--Suggested.-->

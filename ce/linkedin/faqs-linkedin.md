**Why am I unable to sync or load photos of my contacts from LinkedIn to the org chart?**  

**Answer:** 

Currently, we don't support syncing or loading contact profile pictures from LinkedIn to the org chart. The org chart displays only the pictures that are stored in Dynamics 365 for contact records.

<a name="upgrade-solution-2-to-3-version"> </a>
**Why is my LinkedIn Solution not upgraded from 2.x to 3.x version?**

**Answer:**

Because there is no functionality upgrade to the LinkedIn Solution 3.x version, we are not upgrading and there would be no impact on your current solution (2.x version).

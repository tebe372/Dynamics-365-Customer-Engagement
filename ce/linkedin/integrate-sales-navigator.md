# Integrate LinkedIn Sales Navigator solutions for Dynamics 365

Digital transformation is real. Across every industry vertical, companies are rethinking their business processes and entire segments are reorganizing. Enhance key application scenarios by connecting the system of record with the LinkedIn data graph and insights. Build custom applications powered by LinkedIn Sales Navigator intelligence, enhancing business processes with data about people, organizations and relationships. 

## Unified Interface apps: LinkedIn Sales Navigator Controls for Dynamics 365 Unified Interface 

Two LinkedIn Sales Navigator controls are available with a total of eight modules. These [controls can be placed on any desktop Unified Interface application](add-sales-navigator-controls-forms.md) form and are [available through AppSource](install-sales-navigator.md). 

The **LinkedIn Sales Navigator Lead** control shows information about a LinkedIn member profile. This control has four modules, which can be mixed and matched: 

- **Top Card**: shows information about the person like name, headline, and more. Additionally, provides capabilities to message or save the person as a lead in Sales Navigator. 

- **News (Icebreakers)**: shows the personâ€™s highlights, activities, conversation starters, and more.

- **Connections (Get Introduced)**: shows the mutual connections and allows for an introduction to the person. 

- **Related Leads**: shows potential leads who are similar to the target person and might represent the relevant stakeholders around them. On a sales scenario, this insight is crucial to identify the potential decision makers for a deal. 

The **LinkedIn Sales Navigator Account** control shows information about a LinkedIn company profile. This control has four modules, which can be mixed and matched: 

- **Top Card**: shows information about the company like company name, industry, location and more. Additionally, provides capabilities to view the related account and save it in Sales Navigator. 

- **News**: shows the latest news of this company. 

- **Connections**: shows relevant connections for this company that can establish a first contact. 

- **Recommended Leads**: shows the recommended potential leads in this company that may be opportunities open for the next deal. 

Both controls also provide an alternate version, which takes a lookup (entity reference) attribute instead of the attributes described above. 

- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator Lead lookup** control: the name of the referenced entity is used as the member first name and last name. The string is separated by white spaces and the first component is considered the first name while the remaining components are considered last names.

- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator Account lookup** control: the name of the referenced entity is used as the company name.

Once a match is found, subsequent loads are done through the record GUID association. If the control does not load the correct profile on the first match, users can resolve the issue by [finding the correct match](view-sales-navigator-forms.md) with the provded search interface.

 ##Create a dynamic segment

1.  From the Segmentation Dashboard, select **Add** > **Dynamic Segment**.

    ![](../media/SegmentAddDynamic75.png "Add Dynamic Segment"). 

3.  Fill in the values and select **Save**.

 ![](../media/SegmentNewDynamic650.png "New Dynamic Segment")

    **Properties**
    |**Item**|**Description**|
    | ----------- | ---------- |
    | Segment Name | The name of the dynamic segment. |
    | Description | A description of the segment. |
    | Audience type | The profile to segment on.  |
    | Status |  |

    **Flow**: Use this to visually build your segment.

    **Designer**: Choose this for an interactive approach more suited to advanced users.

    **Query**: Use this to manually enter a query.

###Example: Using Flow to define a dynamic segment

The following are settings for a dynamic segment to find customers using security products with low satisfaction.

![](../media/SegmentDynamicSocial720.png "Example Dynamic Segment")

A group consists of profiles joined together by set operations such as union, intersect, and exclude. 

Note that all profiles included with the group end with the node selected in Audience type; in this case, Customer. 

![](../media/SegmentGroupAndAudienceType720.png "Audience Type and Group")

Let's say you want to segment a group that has the following attributes:
- Customers who use security products
- Security product 5567 is not included
- Customer satisfaction is < 60

Here are the steps:

1. On the Properties page for Dynamic Segment, select **+ Add Group**.

2. In the group, select **Product**, enter "Security" for Product.Category, and then click **Add** (+).

2. For Product.ProductID, enter "5567", click **Add** (+), and then click **And**.

    ![](../media/SegmentProductID75.png)

3. For Customer.CustomerSatisfaction, select **<**, enter "60", the click **Add** (+).

    ![](../media/SegmentCustomerSat75.png)

4. Select **OK** to save these group settings.

The group created from these steps consists of people using security products (excluding 5567) whose satisfaction is less than 60 out of 100.

Select the **Query** tab to see the group settings defined as a query.

    **Properties**
    |**Item**|**Description**|
    | ----------- | ---------- |
    | Segment Name | The name of the compound segment. |
    | Description | A description of the segment. |
    | Status |  |

###Example: A compound segment for high value customers

The following steps show the creation of a compound segment of high credit card balance customers who should be sent a followup communication.

    ![](../media/SegmentHighBalance75.png) 

2. Exclude the customers who do not want to be contacted.

    There are four customers who will be excluded.

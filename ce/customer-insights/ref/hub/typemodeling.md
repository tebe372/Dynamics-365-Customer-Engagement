Type Modeling APIs (Hub)
=======================

[!include[pre release disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

These APIs enable management of the primary modeling entity types, such as [Profile](../types/profile.md) and [Interaction](../types/interaction.md), for a Customer Insights Hub.

The ARM APIs provide similar functionality with [Type Modeling APIs (ARM)](../arm/typemodeling.md).

Data Connector Management APIs (Hub)
====================================

[!include[pre release disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

These APIs enable management of [Connectors](../types/connector.md) and [Connector Mappings](../types/connectormapping.md) for a Customer Insights Hub.

The ARM APIs provide similar functionality with [Data Connectors Management APIs (ARM)](../arm/dataconmngnt.md).

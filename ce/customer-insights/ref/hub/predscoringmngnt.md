Predictive Scoring APIs (Hub)
===========================

[!include[pre release disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

These APIs apply machine learning models to analyze and predict process outcomes. Although they can be used to predict any business process, the most common  scenarios include scoring leads and opportunities in sales operations and special campaigns. 

These Hub APIs provide similar functionality to [Predictive Scoring APIs (ARM)](../arm/predscoringmngnt.md).

Data Connector Management APIs (ARM)
=====================================

[!include[pre release disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

These APIs enable management of [Connectors](../types/connector.md) and [Connector Mappings](../types/connectormapping.md) for a Customer Insights Hub.

The Hub APIs provide similar functionality with [Data Connectors Management APIs (Hub)](../hub/dataconmngnt.md).

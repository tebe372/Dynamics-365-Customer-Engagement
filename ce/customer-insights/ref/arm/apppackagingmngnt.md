App Packaging Management APIs (ARM)
===================================

[!include[pre release disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

These APIs enable management of [Widget Types](../types/widgettype.md) and [App Views](../types/view.md) in a Customer Insights web application.  

The Hub APIs provide similar functionality with [App Packaging Management APIs (Hub)](../hub/apppackagingmngnt.md).

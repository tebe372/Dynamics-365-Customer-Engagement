Modeling APIs (ARM)
====================

[!include[pre release disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

These APIs enable management of the primary modeling entity types, such as [Profile](../types/profile.md) and [Interaction](../types/interaction.md), for a Customer Insights Hub.

The Hub APIs provide similar functionality with [Type Modeling APIs (Hub)](../hub/typemodeling.md).

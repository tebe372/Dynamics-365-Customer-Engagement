Hub CRUD APIs (ARM)
==================

[!include[pre release disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

These APIs help perform CRUD operations on Customer Insights [Hubs](../types/hub.md). The functionality they provide is only available through the ARM API (and not available in the Hub APIs). Customer Insights Hub names must be globally unique.  Once a hub is created, the [Hub Management APIs](./hubmngnt.md) enable creating and working with resources for that hub. 

For more information about administration of hubs, see [Create your Customer Insights hub](../../deploy/createdcihub.md).

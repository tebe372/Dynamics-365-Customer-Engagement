RBAC Management APIs (ARM)
==========================

[!include[pre release disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

These APIs enable management of [Roles](../types/role.md) and [Role Assignments](../types/roleassignment.md) on a Customer Insights Hub. Role Based 
Access Control (RBAC) depends upon Azure Active Directory (AAD).

The Hub APIs provide similar functionality with [RBAC Management APIs (Hub)](../hub/rbacmngnt.md).

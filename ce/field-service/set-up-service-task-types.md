# Set up service task types in Dynamics 365 Field Service

Service task types in [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] are used to define the "types" of service tasks that you will include in your incident types and work orders, and are performed by the field agent at the service location. Service tasks can be assigned a duration that rolls up to the work order duration.  
  
 Service tasks are used to create process steps, or checklists, for the field agent to follow when completing a work order, and can be added manually or by associating incident types with each work order.  
  
 Creating numerous service tasks is a good way of guiding a field agent through the work order process. For example, in a work order that calls for replacing the compressor of a refrigerator, a service task type list can show five important steps in the processes. The field agent can then mark each task as it is completed.  
  
1.  From the main menu, go to **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Service Task Type**.  
  
2.  On the **Service Task Type** screen, select **+New** in the upper left corner.  
  
     Assign the task an **Estimated Duration**.  
  
3.  Use the **Description** field to add additional text describing the task.  
  
4.  Select **Save**.  
  
5.  In the **Notes** section, enter any additional notes regarding the task.

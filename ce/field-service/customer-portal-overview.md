# Enable customers to self-schedule service appointments in Field Service (preview)

Field Service self-service scheduling aims to improve your customers' scheduling experience by providing them flexibility to schedule on their own time, directly from their devices.


Customer experience homepages provide a one-stop destination for your service end customers to book new appointments, manage existing appointments, track their technician, and provide feedback.

In this article, we'll walk through the customer experience homepages, and how they work for end customers.

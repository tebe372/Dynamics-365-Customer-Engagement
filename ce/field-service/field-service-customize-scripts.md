# Write scripts to implement complex business logic in Field Service

In some Field Service implementations, there are functionalities requested by the stakeholders which go beyond the functionalities offered by the Out-of-the-Box CRM instance

It allows you to write custom functionality in CRM that can be shared across CRM deployments.

Plugins allow you to write your own custom functionality on top of Microsoftâ€™s event-driven dynamics platform for just about any process you can imagine.

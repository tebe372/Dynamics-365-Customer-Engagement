# Visualizing device readings

After an IoT alert is received, the alert needs to be diagnosed. The first step is to understand the current state of the device. The next step is to further analyze the history and trending of the measurements from the device, and repair history. That can help to analyze the problem and perform remediate actions. 


Device Readings (Preview) is provided to explore near real time and historical trending of measurements as well as historical work orders from IoT device which trigged alert. The chart is available in IoT Alert, Work Order, Case, Device, Asset form for users to access. 

To enable the Device Readings (Preview) chart, organization admin needs to deploy Azure Time Series (Preview) into customer Azure subscription when choosing to deploy it.

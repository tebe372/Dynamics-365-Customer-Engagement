# Booking timestamps in Dynamics 365 Field Service

In Dynamics 365 Field Service, booking timestamps record the date and time that the **Booking Status** changes on a work order. Booking timestamps are useful for: 

- Reporting, in order to see how technicians are spending their time
- Time-keeping, in order to provide a level of detail for invoicing
- Booking journals, in order to see a holistic view of time spent on any given work order

In this topic, we'll look at how to create, view, and configure booking timestamps. 


## Prerequisites

Make sure you have booking statuses that match your business and reporting needs. Many booking statuses exist by default and correspond with the work order process. These booking statuses have an associated Field Service Status. For example, the out-of-the-box "In progress" booking status has a Field Service Status of "In progress" and this changes the related work order system status to "Open-In Progress" automatically. To understand how booking statuses and work orders effect each other, see the topic on [work order lifecycle and statuses](./work-order-status-booking-status.md). 

You can create custom booking statuses that work the same way. For example, the "Arrived On Site" booking status in the following screenshot is a custom creation that is also related to the "In progress" Field Service status.

> [!Note]
> Not all booking statuses need to be associated with Field Service Status, nor do they all need to relate to work order bookings.


## Create timestamps

Lets walk through an example.

Assume a work order was created and scheduled to a technician.  When the dispatcher scheduled the booking, it was given a booking status of "Scheduled" by default.

Next, the technician sees the booking and work order on their mobile device and updates the booking status to reflect progress by changing it to traveling, in progress, completed, or some other custom booking status.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Field Service Mobile on a tablet device, showing the booking status field.](./media/scheduling-timestamps-mobile-status.png)


**Timestamps are created to document when the booking status is updated**. 

> [!Note]
> Booking timestamps work when Field Service Mobile is in offline mode too. This means that every time a technician changes their booking status, the timestamp documenting the status change is saved locally to the device, and synced to the server when internet access is resumed. Booking statuses can also be updated in the back office by dispatchers on the booking form or schedule board and timestamps will alos be created in this scenario.


## View timestamps

You can see timestamps by going to the booking (entity name bookableresourcebooking), then **Related** > **Booking Timestamps**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of booking timestamps on a bookable resource booking.](./media/scheduling-timestamps-booking-statuses-per-fs-status.png)


Each booking timestamp details: 

- **Booking Status**: What the status changed to.

- **System Status**: The related Field Service status for work order process, if applicable.

- **Timestamp Time**: The date and time of status change.

- **Timestamp Source**: The device from which the status was changed. If the status was changed from Field Service Mobile, this will read **Mobile**. If the status was changed from the schedule board, it will read **Desktop**. 

> [!Note]
> By default Booking Timestamps are only generated when there is a change in the related Field Service Status which is noted on each booking status, but this is configurable based on the **Timestamp Frequency setting** described below.

To help illustrate, consider that you have three booking statuses: 

1. **Arrived On Site**, associated with the Field Service status **In Progress**
2. **Wrench Time**, associated with the Field Service status **In Progress**
3. **Complete**, associated with the Field Service status **Complete**

When a technician updates their booking Status on Field Service Mobile to **Arrived On Site**, a timestamp will be created. When they arrive onsite and begin work, they mark the booking status as **Wrench Time**. By default in Field Service, a new timestamp will *not* be created, as the associated Field Service status is still **In Progress**. When the booking status is updated to **Complete**, another timestamp will be created, as the associated Field Service status is different. 


## Timestamp frequency setting

> [!Note]
> This functionality is available in early access as of February 3, 2020. For more information, visit [this article on opting into early access features](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/opt-in-early-access-updates).


The **Timestamp Frequency** setting allows you to choose when booking timestamps are created.

Go to **Field Service** > **Settings** > **Field Service Settings**

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the timestamp frequency functionality in Field Service settings.](./media/scheduling-timestamps-frequency-setting.png)

In the **Timestamp Frequency** field, choose one of the following options:

 - **Per Field Service Status Change** to create timestamps only when a booking status change results in a field service status change. This is the default setting as seen in the previous scenario.
- **Per Booking Status Change** to create timestamps with every booking status change.

The main difference is how detailed an organization wants to be for time entry, reporting, and integration purposes.


### Per Field Service Status Change

Using our example with three booking statuses each with a related Field Service status, if **Timestamp Frequency** is set to *Per Field Service Status Change* the related booking timestamps will be created as seen the following screenshot.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of booking timestamps on a bookable resource booking.](./media/scheduling-timestamps-booking-statuses-per-fs-status.png)

Only the timestamp for "Arrived on site" is generated because timestamps are created when there's a change in the Field Service status of a booking status, and in this example both are considered "In Progress."

### Per Booking Status Change

If Timestamp Frequency setting is set to *Per Booking Status Change* the related booking timestamps will be created as seen the image below.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of booking timestamps on a bookable resource booking.](./media/scheduling-timestamps-booking-statuses-per-booking.png)


With the **Per Booking Status** setting, a timestamp is created for all booking status changes regardless if it results in a field service status change.

In our example, this means both "Arrived on site" and "Wrench time" are recorded. The main difference is how detailed an organization wants to be for reporting and integration purposes.


## Additional notes 

- Booking timestamps are used to calculate **Booking Journals** that calculate total travel time and working time for a specific booking. From the booking, go to **Related** > **Booking Journals** to see them. The **Timestamp Frequency** setting _does not_ affect how booking journals are created or calculated.

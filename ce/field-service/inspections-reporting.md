## Understand, view, and report inspection responses

All the responses entered by technicians are stored in Common Data Service. They can configure analytics settings in **Field Service settings**, which lets them parse the inspection responses into individual question responses.

There are three entities stored in Common Data Service:

1. **Customer Voice survey question**: each inspection question
2. **Customer Voice survey response**: a response to an inspection
3. **Customer Voice survey question response**: each individual response to each inspection question

In this section, we'll walk through how to configure the analytics settings in order to parse individual inspection responses into individual question responses.

First, we'll define how often inspection answers should be parsed and organized in Common Data Service.

Go to **Field Service app** > **Settings** > **Field Service Settings** > **Inspection tab**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Field Service settings page.](./media/0-inspection-snapshot-parse-response.png)

Make sure **Analytics enabled** is set to **Yes**. For **Analytics frequency**, consider the following options:

- **Daily**: Every day on the **Record generation start time**, the **Deserialization of Inspection Response – Recurrent** flow triggers and updates the deserialized inspection response JSON in ```msfp_surveyresponse``` and creates new records for responses and corresponding questions in the ```msfp_questionresponse``` entity.
- **Immediately**:  As soon as a work order service task is marked complete, the **Deserialization of Inspection Response** flow triggers and updates the deserialized inspection response JSON in ```msfp_surveyresponse```, and also creates new records for responses and corresponding questions in ```msfp_questionresponse``` entity.
- **Custom**: Define your own frequency in number of days. See the following screenshot for an example.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the analytics section on inspection settings, showing custom configurations.](./media/customFrequency.jpg)

> [!Note]
> When analytics frequency is set to **Immediately**, the inspection response is parsed and persisted as soon as the service task is completed; the parsed responses won't be updated even if the technician makes changes and completes the inspection again. However, if the analytics frequency is set to **Daily** or **Custom**, the responses are stored from the latest completion of the service task *before* the flow start time.

Next, we need to create and publish an inspection. See the following screenshot for an example.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a sample inspection in Field Service.](./media/1-inspections-snapshot-1.jpg)

In our example, we've created an inspection with four questions.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the sample inspection, showing additional questions.](./media/2-inspections-snapshot-2.jpg)

After publishing an inspection, the questions are stored in Common Data Service, and can be found in the **Customer Voice survey question** entity in Power Apps. Here, you can see entries for each question on an inspection.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Power Apps, showing the Customer Voice survey question entity detail page.](./media/5-snapshot-after-publish-inspection.jpg)

If a question on an inspection has no response, the **Customer Voice survey question response** entity detail will remain empty.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/6-response-snapshot-before-completion.jpg)

Back on our sample inspection, we added some values for the questions, as seen in the following screenshot, and saved the inspection. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of an inspection with questions answered.](./media/7-snapshot-after-response-1.jpg)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of an inspection with additional questions answered.](./media/8-response-snapshot-after-completion-2.jpg)

Back in Power Apps, on the **Customer Voice survey question response** entity, you'll see the values to each submitted response from the inspection.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Power Apps showing the inspection responses in the Customer Voice survey question response entity.](./media/9-CDS-data-upon-completion.jpg)

> [!Note]
> All the logic described in this section of the article is driven by a Power Automate flow to deserialize inspection definitions, and is shipped by default with the inspections feature.
>
> Upon publish of an inspection, the deserialized inspection definition JSON data is ingested into the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice entity **msfp_question**. This flow gets triggered on state changed to published and performs the same.

## Parse inspection responses

Inspection parsing allows you to isolate and select specific parts of inspection responses, like taking an inspection attachment or image within a response to use for other business processes.

## Configuration considerations



### Use Power Automate flow to parse inspection responses 

When a technician fills out an inspection, the answers to each inspection question are stored as JSON in the **Inspection Response** entity.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of inspection responses showing up in the lookup dropdown in an advanced find window.](./media/inspection-inspection-responses-advanced-find.png)

Use a Power Automate flow to run a workflow on inspection responses.

In the following example, if a technician responds "Yes" to the inspection question "Is a follow-up required?" then a new follow-up work order service task is added to the related work order.

> [!Note]
> Out-of-the-box flows cannot be customized. You must create or copy a Power Automate flow in order to customize it.

### Create a flow

Go to [https://flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com), sign in, choose your environment, and create a new flow.

Choose **Automated - from blank**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Power Automate, on the New dropdown menu showing Automated - from blank.](./media/inspections-workflow-create-flow.png)

Name the flow and select **Skip** to choose the trigger on the flow editor page.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Build an automated flow window.](./media/inspections-workflow-name.png)

 
### Create a trigger 

Search for "Dynamics 365" in **Connectors** and choose the trigger as **When a record is created or updated**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a list of triggers in Power Automate.](./media/inspections-workflow-trigger.png)
 
This flow will relate to the **Work Order Service Task** entity because technicians view and respond to inspections from this entity. Choose **Work Order Service Tasks** for the **Entity Name**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the flow for when a record is created or updated.](./media/inspections-workflow-step1.png)
 
### Fetch the response from the database

Next, we need to retrieve the inspection responses.

Add a step using the **Get record** action in "Dynamics 365." 

Choose **Inspection Responses** as the entity to get and **Inspection Response ID** in the item identifier because this field has the ID of the inspection response record.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Power Automate showing the get record part of a flow showing inspection responses in the item identifier field.](./media/inspections-workflow-fetch-inspection-response.png)
 
### Extract the JSON

Add an **Initialize Variable** action to retrieve the response from **ResponseJsonContent** field.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a Power Automate flow, showing the "retrieve the encoded response json" part of the flow.](./media/inspections-workflow-get-JSON-content.png)
 
### Decode the response

Now we need to convert the response's JSON into a usable format.

Add an **Initialize Variable** action to url decode and base 64 decode the response JSON:

```decodeUriComponent(decodeBase64(variables('responseJson')))```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot showing the Decode the json part of the Power Automate flow.](./media/inspections-workflow-decode-JSON.png)

### Update the schema

Provide the schema with the name of the question you want to run a workflow on.

In our example, the schema is:

```
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "Followup": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    }
}
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Parse JSON section of the Power Automate flow, showing the schema field populated with the previous snippet.](./media/inspections-workflow-update-schema.png)

If you're having trouble generating the schema, you can select the **Generate from sample** option and enter the name and sample answer of your inspection question and response.

In our example, we can enter:

```{"Followup":"Yes"}```

"Followup" comes from the inspection question's name value, as seen in the following screenshot:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of an inspection in Field Service, showing the name field.](./media/inspections-workflow-schema-name.png)

### Condition-based action

Next we'll add a condition and action based on the response to the inspection question.

In this example, we'll create a **Work Order Service Task** with another **Service Task Type** in the same work order when the "Followup" inspection question has "Yes" as the answer.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Power Automate flow, showing a condition step where the followup field is equal to yes.](./media/inspections-workflow-if-condition-yes.png)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Power Automate flow, showing the "if yes" condition set to trigger a new record creation.](./media/inspections-workflow-then-create-WOST.png)

Save and test your flow.

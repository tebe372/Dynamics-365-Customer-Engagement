# Installation and setup - Connected Field Service for Azure IoT Hub

This guide provides all the steps required for getting up and running with Connected Field Service (CFS) for IoT Hub.

> [!NOTE]
> Time Series Insights (TSI) will be deprecated after March 2025. We'll transition Connected Field Service to a new platform and announce it when the deprecation takes place. More information: [Migrate to Azure Data Explorer](/azure/time-series-insights/migration-to-adx)

## Prerequisites

 Ensure the following before configuring Connected Field Service.
  
- [Dynamics 365 Field Service is installed](install-field-service.md).
  
- System Administrator and IoT-Administrator security roles.

- [IoT Provider for IoT Hub](cfs-provider-iot-hub.md) in Dynamics 365 Field Service.

- Active [Azure subscription with privileges to create resources and services](cfs-azure-subscription.md).

- For Azure Time Series Insights, [create an app registration](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) in the Azure portal. Take note of the Application (client) ID and the Object ID. [Add a client secret](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret), and record the client secret value. You'll need these values multiple times during the installation.

## Step 1: Deploy Connected Field Service and Azure resources from an ARM template

Deploy and connect Azure IoT Hub to your Field Service environment. Go to the **Deployment steps** section on [https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-Connected-Field-Service-Deployment](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-Connected-Field-Service-Deployment#deploy-the-arm-template) and deploy the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. Select Deploy to Azure to initiate the deployment.

1. Choose an existing Azure subscription. Choose a resource group or create one in the selected subscription. Set the region to the same region as your Field Service environment.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ARM-deployment-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Resource Manager template to deploy IoT Hub for Connected Field Service.":::

1. Enter the [unique name of your organization](/power-platform/admin/determine-org-id-name#find-your-organization-name), and the [organization URL](/power-platform/admin/determine-org-id-name#find-your-environment-and-organization-id).

1. Select the optional resources you want to deploy.
   - We recommend adding **Azure Time Series Insights** to enable visualization for device readings and summary tiles.
   - Add the simulator to test and validate IoT scenarios with sample data.
   - To create you own reports in Power BI, add the SQL server and provide the credentials you want to create.

1. Review and create the resources from the template.

Before proceeding, ensure the deployment is complete.  

## Step 2: Create new IoT Provider Instance

1. Sign into your Dynamics 365 organization and open the Connected Field Service app module.

1. In Connected Field Service, go to the **Settings** area.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cfs-iothub-settings-area.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Change area control.":::

1. Select **Providers** and select **New**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cfs-iothub-create-provider.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new IoT Hub provider.":::

1. On the **New IoT Provider Instance** page, fill out the fields:

   :::image type="content" source="media/cfs-iot-hub-provider-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a new IoT Hub provider instance with sample data.":::

   - **Name**: Enter the name of the resource group in Azure where you deployed IoT resources.
   - **IoT Provider**: [Choose or create the IoT provider for IoT Hub](cfs-provider-iot-hub.md).
   - **Provider Instance Id**: Enter the name of the IoT Hub resource that was deployed to your resource group in Azure.
   - **URL**: Enter the URL of the overview for the resource group in the Azure portal. Example: `https://portal.azure.com/[tenant_id]/subscriptions/[subscription_id]/resourceGroups/[resource_group_name]/overview`.

1. Select **Save** to create the new IoT Provider Instance record.

1. We now need to update the IoT Provider Settings for the newly created provider instance. In the **Settings** area, select **IoT Settings** > **IoT Provider Settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cfs-iothub-default-provider-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Default Provider Instance page.":::

1. For **Default IoT Provider**, set the **Instance** to the IoT Provider Instance you created previously.

1. Select **Save & Close** to save your changes.

## Step 3: Set up IoT endpoint

1. Download the [Power Platform CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI) and install it.

1. Open the CLI and launch the [Plugin Registration Tool (PRT)](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/tool#pac-tool-prt) with the command `pac tool prt`.

1. In the PRT window, select **Create New Connection** and sign in to the Dynamics 365 environment where you're setting up Connected Field Service.

1. Once connected to the organization, find the **IoT Message** Service Endpoint and select it.

1. Select **Update**.

1. For **NameSpace Address**, find the hostname for the [Service Bus Namespace](/azure/service-bus-messaging/explorer#use-the-service-bus-explorer) deployed to your resource group. Enter the hostname in the Plug-in Registration Tool, prefixed by `sb://`. Example: `sb://myServiceBusNamespace.servicebus.windows.net`

1. In the Service Bus Namespace resource, go to **Queues** and find the queue with a name ending in `-crm`. Copy the full name and enter it as the **Topic Name** in the Plug-in Registration Tool.
1. For **Message Format**, choose *XML*.

1. In the Service Bus Namespace resource, go to **Shared access policies** > **RootManageSharedAccessKey**.
   - Copy the name and paste it for SaS Key Name.
   - Copy the [primary key](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-topics-subscriptions-portal) and paste it into the Plug-in Registration Tool for **SAS Key**.

1. Select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="media/cfs-iothub-register-service-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Plug-in Registration Tool.":::

## Step 4: Authorize Azure app connection

Connect the Azure IoTHub to your Field Service environment.

1. Sign into your Azure account, and then go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. On the Azure portal, go to **Resource Groups** and find the resource group you recently deployed IoT Hub to. See the following screenshot for reference.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of Azure resource groups.](./media/cfs-iothub-resource-group.png)

1. One resource of type API Connection is called **commondataservice**. Select and edit this resource.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of API connection between dynamics and azure.](./media/cfs-iothub-api-connection.png)

1. Select **Authorize** and sign in with your Dynamics 365 credentials that you use to sign into your Connected Field Service environment. They may be different than your Azure credentials to the Azure portal. Select **Save** to apply your changes.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of authorizing the subscription.](./media/cfs-iothub-api-connection-authorize.png)

## Step 5: Update devicerules.json

Skip this step if the simulator isn't deployed. The Stream Analytics job deployed to your resource group will have a reference to a `devicerules.json` file. This file defines a rule that is used to create IoT Alerts when using the optional device simulator. To use the rule, upload the `devicerules.json` file and reproduce the directory structure. The exact structure is needed for the sample alert to work.

1. Download the `devicerules.json` file from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-Connected-Field-Service-Deployment).

1. Open the resource group in the Azure admin portal and select the storage account deployed to your resource group. Select **Containers** and create a container called `devicerules`.

1. Use the Storage Browser to open the newly created `devicerules` container.

1. Upload the `devicerules.json` file to a new folder named `2016-05-30`.

1. In the `2016-05-30` folder, create another folder called `22-40`, and upload the `devicerules.json` file.

## Step 6: Start Azure Stream Analytics job

1. Sign into your Azure account, and then go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. On the Azure portal, go to **Resource Groups** and find the resource group you recently deployed IoT Hub to.

1. Select each Stream Analytics job that was deployed and, from the **Overview** tab, select **Start**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cfs-iothub-stream-analytics-start.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Stream Analytics job overview.":::

Congratulations! You're now ready to pass data between Azure IoT Hub and Dynamics 365 to use Connected Field Service.

## Step 7: Update Azure Time Series Insights connection

Use Azure Time Series Insights to create visualizations.

1. Open the Connected Field Service app module in Dynamics 365.

1. Launch the browser developer tools and go to the console.

1. Enter the following script into the console and run it, replacing the `Value` parameter with the Azure tenant ID. You can [get the tenant ID from the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant).

    ```javascript
    
    var req = {};
    
    req.getMetadata = function () {
        return {
            boundParameter: null,
            parameterTypes: {
                "Key": {
                    "typeName": "Edm.String",
                    "structuralProperty": 1
                },
                "Value": {
                    "typeName": "Edm.String",
                    "structuralProperty": 1
                },
            },
            operationType: 0,
            operationName: "msdyn_IoTSetConfiguration"
        };
    };
    
    req["Key"]="TSI_PLUGIN_AZURE_TENANT_ID";
    req["Value"]="REPLACE";
    
    Xrm.WebApi.online.execute(req).then( 
        function (data) { 
            console.log("Success Response Status: " + data.status);
        }, 
        function (error) { 
            console.log("Error: " + error.message);
        }
    );
    ```

1. Run the script again, replacing the `Key` with `TSI_PLUGIN_CLIENT_APPLICATION_ID` and the `Value` with the `Application Client ID` from the app registration for Time Series Insights that you created as a [prerequisite](#prerequisites).

1. Run the script again, replacing the `Key` with `TSI_PLUGIN_CLIENT_SECRET` and the `Value` with the `Application Client ID` from the app registration for Time Series Insights that you created and recorded as a [prerequisite](#prerequisites).

1. Run the following script, using your Time Series Insights URL and the GUID of the IoT Provider Instance row in the msdyn_iotproviderinstance table for the instance you created earlier.

    ```javascript
    var data = {"msdyn_timeseriesinsightsurl": "Enter Data Access FQDN found on Time Series Insights environment overview"};
    Xrm.WebApi.updateRecord("msdyn_iotproviderinstance", "Copy the value for msdyn_iotproviderinstanceid from the json object returned with the API call https://[your-environment-name].crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/msdyn_iotproviderinstances", data);
    ```

## Step 9: Set up the simulator (optional)

The simulator lets you test Connected Field Service without the need to connect physical hardware. Simulated IoT devices and data help you understand different parts that contribute to turning IoT data into work orders.

Set up the simulator to simulate IoT devices and data and begin to see device data pulled into Field Service.

To find the simulator URL, sign in to your Azure subscription, and then select the App Service resource type that starts with "Simulator" under the newly created resource group. You’ll see the URL is in the top-right corner. Copy the URL and complete the following steps:  
  
1. Paste the URL into your browser’s address bar to load the page.  
  
1. When the simulator page opens, select **Connection**.  
  
1. Enter the IoT hub host name and key. The host is simply the name of the IoT Hub resource in Azure portal.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of the "configure connection" dialog in Azure.](./media/cfs-iothub-thermostadt-simulator.png)

   The key can be accessed by selecting the IoT Hub resource and going to the shared access policies, then copying the primary key for **iothubowner** as seen in the following screenshot.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of Azure IoT Hub showing the primary key.](./media/cfs-simulator-connection.png)
  
1. Select the IoT hub in the **Resource Group**.  
  
1. On the left under **General**, select **Shared access policies** to get the host name and primary key.  
  
1. Make sure **Connection status**  is marked as **Connected** and then close the dialog box.  

Now you can send a test command by using the sample simulator. For example, select the temperature and increase it to above 70 degrees. The simulator is preprogrammed to create an IoT alert if temperature is above 70 degrees.

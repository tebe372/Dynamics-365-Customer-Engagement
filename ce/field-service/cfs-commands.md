## Create business process flows to automatically handle incoming IoT alerts

When you receive an alert from a device, your service team can manually monitor the alerts and troubleshoot the issue remotely. If the issue is not resolved by sending a remote command, the service rep can create a case or work order and dispatch a field tech. The provided business process flow guides you through the process of manually responding to IoT alerts.

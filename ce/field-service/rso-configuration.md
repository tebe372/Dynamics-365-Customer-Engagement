# Resource Scheduling Optimization configuration

Perform these configuration steps after [successful deployment](rso-deployment.md) of the Resource Scheduling Optimization solution.

## Enable Resource Scheduling Optimization

1. Go to **Resource Scheduling Optimization** > **Administration** > **Scheduling Parameters**.

1. On the General tab, set **Connect to Maps** as **Yes**. The setting connects the organization with the Bing Maps service that the schedule board uses. You need a system administrator role to enable this setting.

1. Go to the Resource Scheduling Optimization tab.

   - Set **Enable Resource Scheduling Optimization** to **Yes**.

   - Set **Default Goal** if needed. A default [optimization goal](rso-optimization-goal.md) helps speed up interactions with Resource Scheduling Optimization through the schedule board. It defines how the engine optimizes data. Users can still choose different goals.

## Add required security roles to users who will configure and run Resource Scheduling Optimization

Ensure that Resource Scheduling Optimization can optimize work order-related requirements and bookings:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings** > **Security** > **Users**. And assign the security role *Field Service - Administrator* to the Resource Scheduling Optimization application user.

1. Go to **Security** > **Field Security Profiles**. Select **Resource Scheduling Optimization â€“ Administrator** and add the Resource Scheduling Optimization application user to the field security profile.
  
Enable dispatchers to interact with Resource Scheduling Optimization:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Users**.

1. Locate the user or team of dispatchers.

1. Select **Manage Roles**.

1. Assign a security role.

1. Select **Save**.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Field Security Profiles**.

1. Open **Resource Scheduling Optimization - Dispatcher** and add the user or team to the profile and then select **Save**.

## Make data changes to prepare for optimizations

The settings described in this section apply to all optimization scopes.

1. Go to **Resource Scheduling Optimization** > **Resources**. Open the **Scheduling Summary** view. Select one or more resource records and select **Edit**.

1. In the Resource Scheduling Optimization tab, set **Optimize Schedule** to **Yes** and **Save** the records.

1. After enabling the resources for schedule optimization, specify the address for the organizational unit or resource address, depending on their start and end location.
  
1. Go to **Resource Scheduling Optimization** > **Settings** > **Administration** > **Enable Resource Scheduling for Entities**.

1. Double-click an enabled entity to configure booking setup metadata. In the **Resource Scheduling Optimization** section, set the **Default Scheduling Method** to **Optimize** and **Save** the changes. For example, you can enable it for the work order entity. Every new work order and related resource requirement will be configured to optimize automatically.

   :::image type="content" source="media/rso-entity-default-scheduling-method.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Booking Setup Metadata, with Default Scheduling Method set to Optimize.":::

1. For existing resource requirement records, update the resource requirements scheduling method. Go to **Resource Scheduling Optimization** > **Resource Requirements** and open the **Unscheduled Work Order Requirements** view. Select the records to optimize, and select **Edit**.

   - On the **Resource Scheduling Optimization** tab, set the **Scheduling Method** to **Optimize**.

   - On the Scheduling tab, make sure the location is **On Site** or **Location Agnostic**. If **On Site** is the requirement, you must specify the address.  

   - On the **General** tab, check that **From Date** and **To Date** fall into the time window you want to schedule. You can use the bulk edit feature to update values for selected records as well.

1. Go to **Resource Scheduling Optimization** > **Settings** > **Booking Statuses**. Select a booking status and choose the **Scheduling Method**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/rso-booking-statuses.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing active booking statuses.":::

   - **Optimize**: Allows the system to freely move this booking to optimize scheduling.
   - **Do Not Move**: The system won't change the booking. Resource Scheduling Optimization preserves the estimated arrival time and assigned resource. The start time and estimated travel duration may be changed if the earlier booking is in a new location. It's similar to a user setting the booking to **Locked to resource + time**.
   - **Ignore**: Resource Scheduling Optimization will completely ignore this booking. It will ignore for both location and time, meaning there will be overlaps. Use this setting when the booking status is proposed or canceled.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Booking statuses with no specified scheduling method are treated as Do Not Move.

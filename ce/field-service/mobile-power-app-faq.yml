title: Frequently asked questions for the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app
summary: |
sections:
  - name: Mobile calendar and agenda view  
    questions:  
      - question: Why can't I see the calendar, or I see the wrong calendar?
        answer: |
          To fix this issue, make sure the **Booking Calendar Control** is enabled for phones and tablets from the bookable resource booking entity.

          > ![Screenshot of the mobile booking calendar control.](./media/mobile-2020-booking-calendar-control.png)
         
      - question: Can I customize the default booking calendar control, such as by changing the booking cell content?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can customize the calendar to replace the existing primary field and add up to three custom fields. For more information, see [edit the booking calendar control](/dynamics365/field-service/mobile-power-app-configure#edit-the-bookings-calendar-control).
      
      - question: I created a custom view for my Booking Calendar. Why is the data or certain elements like address aren't displayed for each booking?
        answer: |
          The Booking Calendar control requires certain columns in the view to render all data. Best practice is to start from the Out of the Box view, "Bookings" and use "Save As" in the form designer to create a duplicate with required columns. Modifications can be done from there while not removing default columns.
          If a field such as "Address" is missing from all Bookings on the calendar, it's likely that the Work Order table has been renamed, or modified and the Calendar control won't be able to find the address columns. In this case you need to add proper fields from the renamed entity back into the view.

  - name: Maps and locations
    questions:          
      - question: How do I enable address suggestions?
        answer: |
          The mobile app can recommend addresses as technicians enter them into a work order when an internet connection is available. Address suggestions make data entry quicker and more accurate.    
          
          Enable address recommendations by going to **Field Service app** > **Settings** > **Field Service Settings** > **Other section**, and then set **Enable Address Suggestions** to **Yes**.

          > ![Screenshot of enabled address suggestions in Field Service.](./media/mobile-2020-settings-enable-address-recommendation.png)
          
          When the mobile user has no internet access, they can select **Edit** to manually enter address fields.
      
      - question: Can I configure the "Get Directions" map button to trigger a GPS map provider app of my choosing?
        answer: |
          Currently, the **Get Directions** map button isn't configurable. It will only trigger the device's default map provider.   
  - name: Offline
    questions:

      - question: Is there a way to choose the columns ("fields") that are downloaded as part of a mobile offline profile?
        answer: |
          Offline profiles are filtered at the row level, which adjusts the number of records that are downloaded. There's currently no way to filter by column.
      - question: While running the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app in offline mode with internet connectivity, can I perform a search for content on the server?
        answer: |
          Search from the offline application will always search the local device database for data, which is defined within the mobile offline profile.
      - question: Where are some Commanding options hidden while the application is in Online versus Offline mode?
        answer: |
          Commanding options, which aren't supported in Offline mode, are hidden from the UI after the application transitions to Offline mode. A list of Offline supported Command bar options is available from [Mobile offline capabilities and limitations](/power-apps/mobile/offline-capabilities).
  
  - name: Sign in
    questions:     
        - question: What do the "Reconfigure" and "Sign out" options do?
          answer: |
           - Sign out: The user signs out of the app. After signing out, they can go back to the original sign-in screen where they can either sign in again or use an alternate account to sign in. Signing out and back in will clear Field Service mobile app data that had previously been synced to the device. 
           - Reconfigure: The user remains signed in to the app, but will be sent back to the app module picker where they can select an alternate app module, if available. "Reconfigure" will clear Field Service mobile app data that had previously been synced to the device.

        - question: Why do I get an "Insufficient Permissions" error when accessing records on the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app?
          answer: |
            ![Screenshot of an error message showing "Insufficient Permissions" in the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app.](./media/fsm-error1.jpg)
          
            This error can occur when your environment has multiple Dynamics 365 apps installed.
          
            To fix this issue:
          
            1. Verify that your user is assigned the **Field Service - Resource** security role _and_ field security profile.
            2. Edit the **Field Service - Resource** security role, and assign read privileges for the **Master Entity Routing Configuration** entity in **Custom Entities**.
            3. Edit the **Field Service - Resource** security role, and assign read privileges for the **Routing Rule Set** entity on the **Service Management** tab.

            > ![Screenshot of Field Service security roles in Power Apps, showing permissions for the Field Service - Resource role.](./media/fsm-insufficient-permission-faq.png)


        - question: Why does the app say "Contact your administrator for access to your organization's mobile apps"?
          answer: |
            ![Screenshot of the "Contact your administrator" issue.](./media/mobile-2020-error-contact-administrator-show-nonproduction-apps.png)
          
            If you're getting this message, try the following steps:
          
            1. Select the menu icon in the upper-left corner, and set **Show non-production apps** to **Yes**. The list shows production apps by default, and you might be using a trial or sandbox app. 
            2. Make sure you have the correct security role (Field Service - Resource) and that the security role is assigned to the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app.
            3. Sign in again, pull down the screen to refresh, and wait for at least a few minutes.
          
            If completing steps 1 and 2 doesn't resolve the issue, [submit a support ticket](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/contact-us/).
        - question: Can external guest users access the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app?  
          answer: |
           Yes, frontline workers [enabled as Azure AD B2B collaborator](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b) (guest) can access the mobile app by [switching to the guest tenant](/power-apps/mobile/tenant-switcher).
           
           If a guest user needs to access the application with a personal account, use a formatted deep link to access the guest tenant.

           ```
        - question: Can I access SharePoint documents in offline mode?
          answer: |
           Access to SharePoint documents isn't currently supported in offline mode. 

  - name: Entities, forms, views, and fields 
    questions:
        
      - question: |
          How many columns ("fields") can be added to an entity view on the mobile app?
        answer: |
          Currently, a maximum of three columns (formerly called "fields") can be displayed in a mobile view. 

      - question: |
          Can I only view Field Service entities on the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app?
        answer: |

          Because the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app is a model-driven app on Microsoft Power Platform, any entity can be added; however, users can only see an entity or record that they have the licenses and permissions to access, regardless of whether it's part of the Dynamics 365 Field Service app.

          
      - question: |
          Why doesn't the bookable resource booking form show work order details like customer, service, and notes?
        answer: |
          Sometimes you might not see the correct booking form. You might see a screen resembling the following image.
         
          > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
          > ![Screenshot of the wrong form issue.](./media/mobile-2020-faq-wrong-booking-form.png)
          
          If you see something like the previous screenshot, you're viewing the booking form, and *not* the combined booking and work order form.
          

          To solve this issue, make sure you've signed in to the mobile app as a user who has the **Field Service - Resource** security role. Also make sure that the right form (the mobile-optimized booking and work order form) is associated with the booking entity in the app designer.

      - question: |
          How can I enable multiline text fields on forms to automatically expand based on the amount of content entered?
        answer: |
          To enable auto-expanding fields:
          1. Enter the form designer interface for the entity that contains the multiline text field you want to auto-expand.
          2. Select the desired multiline text field.
          3. Within field properties, select the option "Automatically expand to use available space."
          4. Save and publish.
          
          Note: When using the legacy form designer, there's a restriction of only one text field per tab can autoexpand. Switch to the modern designer to enable more than one field.

      - question: |
         When working in the mobile application, why do users sometimes see “Validations have been restarted in the background…”?
        answer: |
         This error is commonly caused by a timing issue when using synchronous OnSave events. Starting with version 8.8.88.56 of the Field Service (Dynamics 365) Mobile app uses AsyncOnSave to mitigate validation errors for out-of-box scripts. If users continue to see this error, evaluate custom validations and use OnChange events.

    questions:       
     - question: Can I connect the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app to GCC, GCC high, DoD, or China (21Vianet) environments?
       answer: |
          Yes.  To connect to the specific data center end points select **Region settings** from initial app sign-in screen. 
      
          > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
          > ![Screenshot of Region Selector Option.](./media/Mobile-PowerApps-RegionSelector.png)
          
          The region settings dialog allows the user to select and connect to the desired end point.

     - question: Can I download the Field Service (Dynamics 365) app in China market app stores?
       answer: |
          Yes, the Field Service (Dynamics 365) app is available in the following China market app stores: Xiaomi, Lenovo, Baidu, Meizu, and Apple.
          
     - question: How do I change the time zone for the app?
       answer: |
          While signed into the app, select the three vertical lines open the sitemap. Select the settings icon to find **Time Zone**. Change to desired time zone. Fully close and reopen the application for time zone changes to take effect. 
  
     - question: How do I change the language used within the app?
       answer: |
          Users can personalize the language settings for themselves by using the [personalization options available in Power Platform.](/power-apps/user/set-personal-options#languages-tab-options) This setting is currently not available in the Field Service Mobile app itself.

     - question: How do I enable native mobile date and time picker, and input-specific keyboards for my app module? 
       answer: |
          New capabilities to use the native device date and time experience, along with input-specific mobile keyboards, were added to Platform release version 9.2.22033.00153+. These capabilities are enabled by default for the Field Service Mobile app module, but can be enabled for other App Modules with the following steps:
          1. With an admin account, sign in to https://make.powerapps.com. After signing in, be sure to select the correct organization you're targeting from dropdown list.
          2. Select the `...` next to the App Module for which you want to enable the feature. 
          3. Expand **Settings** to **Edit in Preview**. In the resulting screen, select **Settings** from the top navigation.
          4. Drill into **Feature Settings** where you'll find the toggle for these features.
          5. **Save and Publish** your app module.

          > ![Screenshot of app settings.](./media/mobile-powerapps-appsettings.jpg)
          
          After making changes, when interacting with date and time fields on your mobile device they'll use the native device date and time experience. 
          Similarly, after enabling native mobile inputs, the device will raise a specific keyboard depending on the input type of the field for numeric, phone, email, and URL fields.

     - question: Can I use drip scheduling with the Field Service mobile app?
       answer: |
          Drip scheduling is currently not supported with the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app. 
         
     - question: Where can I find the app version and session ID for debugging purposes?
       answer: |
        When opening a case with Microsoft Support, you'll often be asked for details about your app, including the app version and session detail. To find the session and app version details:
        1. After signing into the app, open the main app menu.
        2. Scroll to the bottom of the menu see **General** settings, and then **Session details**.
        3. Open session details where you'll see the app version, along with the current session identifier.

     - question: How do I enable Wave 2 2022 enhancements for command bar and form tabs for my Field Service Mobile application?
       answer: |
          As part of Wave 2 2022, the command bar for Field Service mobile has changed in the following ways:
          - Command bar on Tablets has moved to the top of the view.
          - Certain commands (Delete, Process) are removed for users without access to act on those commands.
          - Rarely used commands are moved to the end of the command bar for easier access to more broadly used commands.
          
          Also as part of Wave 2, form tabs will now lock in place at the top of the screen while navigating down the view, removing the need to scroll to the top of the form to navigate between tabs. 
          
          By default, these changes are enabled for the Field Service Mobile app module. If you're using a custom app module, or want to revert the changes to the previous experience, these changes can be enabled or disabled via App Settings.

          1. With an admin account, sign in to https://make.powerapps.com. After signing in, select the correct organization you're targeting from dropdown list.
          2. Select the `...` next to the App Module for which you want to enable or disable the feature. 
          3. Expand **Settings** to **Edit in Preview**. In the resulting screen, select **Settings** from the top navigation.
          4. Go to **Feature Settings** where you'll find the toggle for these features with the following labels:
          - Lock tabs at the top of forms on mobile and tablets
          - Mobile Commanding Improvements
          - Tablet Optimization for Command Bar
 
          5. Select **Save and Publish** to update your app module.

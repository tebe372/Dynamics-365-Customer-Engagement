## Scenario 1: Schedule a multi-day work order

end: can simply drag and drop too but this creates a continuous booking

## Scenario 2: Schedule a multi-day requirement

requirement
allocation method
requirement details
specify pattern

## Scenario 3: Schedule a multi-day requirement to multiple resources

## Configuration considerations

- full capacity uses calendar
- when scheduling 4 hours each day, they need 4 total hours, not 4 continuous hours
- manual create details when allocation method is none
## Additional Notes
- work order auto creates requirements
- cannot schedule requirement groups for multiple days, menaing you cannot break it up
- travel time?

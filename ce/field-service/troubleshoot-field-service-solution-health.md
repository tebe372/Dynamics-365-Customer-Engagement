# Troubleshoot Field Service issues with Solution Health Hub

The Solution Health Hub extends the PowerApps checker to ensure continued healthy operation of an environment. Where the PowerApps checker reviews code present in an environment to validate the health of the environment based on predefined rules, the Solution Health Hub runs rules within an instance to validate the configuration of the environment, which might change over time through natural system operations.



Currently an Analysis Job is automatically triggered when Field Service is installed from scratch or when it is updated to a recent version. This analysis job verifies that the system is in a good state after upgrading.


Solution Health Hub allows you to get a better picture of the state of your environment. There are a range of issues that are being detected by the rules. There are issues that will later lead to runtime issues, like customized webresources. Another common thing that can be detected is when there are processes that are assigned to disabled users, the upgrade will fail. These things can be detected before they will cause problems and you can address them right then.

It is advisable to use the solution health hub and run the Field Service ruleset regularly and monitor the health of your environment. The other use case is to trigger an analysis job whenever you encounter problems. This way issues can be resolved early on before they cause issues.

## Prerequisites

- Ruleset preconfigured with Field Service v8.4.0.338+ (UCI) or  v7.5.7.87+ (Web)

- At the time of this publication, the ruleset contains 15 rules that verify the environment is in a good state.

This is the full list of rules that are currently being shipped as part of Field Service including a quick description what they are checking for:

| Rule Name: | What it checks: |
| --- | --- | 
| Process Definitions in Draft Status	| Checks whether there are any process definitions in draft status. If there are processes in draft status, Field Service will not work correctly.| 
| Disabled Sdk Message Processing Steps	| Checks whether there are any SdkMessage Processing Steps that are disabled. Disabled Sdk Message Processing Steps will lead to incorrect behavior when using Field Service.| 
| Missing Form Libraries	| Detects if there are any forms in the system that are referencing Field Service libraries without passing the required parameters.| 
| Process Definitions Owned by Disabled Users	| Checks whether there are any process definitions in the system that are assigned to users that are disabled. If that’s the case upgrade will fail.
| Waiting Workflow Instances Owned by Disabled Users	| Detects waiting workflow instances that are assigned to disabled users. These will fail to correctly generate the records that they are supposed to generate.| 
| Customized Web Resources	| Detects which webresources have been customized by solutions that are not part of the Field Service package. This will lead to those webresources not being updated on upgrade and can lead to different functionality issues after upgrade.| 
| Field Service Booking Setup Metadata Configuration	| Checks that the Field Service Booking Setup Metadata record exists correctly in the system. If this record is missing scheduling functionality might not work as expected.| 
| Universal Resource Scheduling Version Compatibility Check	| Verifies that the current installed version of Field Service is compatible with the version of Unified Resource Scheduling. | 
| Agreement Work Order Generation	| Verifies that all Work Orders that were supposed to be generated over the last 7 days were correctly generated by Agreements.| 
| Field Service Settings	| Checks that the Field Service Settings record exists correctly in the system.| 
| Deleted SDK Message Processing Steps	| Verifies that there are no deleted Sdk Message Processing Steps.| 
| Deleted Processes	| Verifies that there are no Deleted Processes.| 
| Deleted Web Resources	| Checks whether there are any deleted webresources.| 
| Incomplete Field Service Upgrade	| Detects whether a Field Service upgrade had started but had not been completed successfully.| 
| Customizations on 'Connected Field Service' app module	| Checks whether there are customizations to the Connected Field Service appmodule that is being deprecated and shouldn’t be customized.| 
| Customized Optionsets	| Detects whether any optionset in Field Service that is not supposed to be customized has been customized. Customizing optionsets can lead to unexpected behavior.| 


## View health check results

You will automatically be directed to the overview page of this Analysis Job and the page will automatically refresh when the run has finished. You can see the overview of a run on the picture below.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/troubleshoot-solution-health-fs-rules-analysis.png)


When running an Analysis Job you will see a Return Status for each rule. The possible options are listed below. Rules also return a severity if they are failing which shows how severe a certain problem is.
The rule status indicates whether the rule passed, failed, or there was a configuration error.


| Rule Status | 	Recommendation|
| --- | --- |  
| Fail	| Highlight specific failures within the system; fix the rule as suggested.| 
| Warning	| Be aware of the implications mentioned in the rule message.| 
| Pass	| Indicates that there are no problems with this rule. All rules should be in this state.|

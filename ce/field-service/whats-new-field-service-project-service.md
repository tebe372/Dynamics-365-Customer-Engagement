## What's new in Update 2  
 **Field Service:**  
  
- **Share the schedule board**: You can now share the schedule board with specific people, everyone, or yourself only.  
  
    - **Just me** – Only the owner of schedule board settings record sees it. This must be a Dynamics 365 user.  
  
    - **Specific people** – Only users with read access to that schedule board settings record see this. This can be based on having higher security rights, or if the record is shared using Dynamics 365 Share functionality.  
  
    - **Everyone** – If the user has access to use the schedule board, they will see these boards.

- **Dim unavailable resources**: When searching for availability on the schedule board, resources that are unavailable in the search can either be dimmed, or removed from the schedule board.  
  
     A user who only wants to see a specific set of resources can choose to dim unavailable resources instead of removing resources that are  not a match while a user  without this requirement can have unavailable resources completely removed from the board. This setting can be changed in the schedule board tab settings.

 **Project Service Automation:**  
  
-   Now you can credit or correct an invoice that was sent to a customer. Quantity of billable hours, bill rates, and other charges and can be corrected or entirely reversed.

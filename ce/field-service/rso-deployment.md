# Deployment of the Resource Scheduling Optimization (RSO) solution

## Deployment steps 

1. Go to the Dynamics 365 admin center and select the **APPLICATIONS** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> **Do not** install the Resource Scheduling Optimization solution from the solution page. Follow the next steps using the RSO deployment app to deploy.

2. Select the **Resource Scheduling Optimization** application to configure or manage.

3. Select the organization where the RSO solution will be installed, review the
    Terms of Service and select the agreement box, and then select **Deploy** to
    start the RSO deployment.

The RSO instance is associated with a single Dynamics 365 organization in the tenant. You can change the associated organization through the RSO deployment appâ€™s page. If additional RSO instances are needed for dev/test and you have an Enterprise Agreement with Microsoft, contact your technical account manager. Such instances are not yet available to Cloud Solution Providers or retail purchase.

4. Click **Upgrade to new version** to apply a new update if one is available.

5. Use **Change Organization** to change the RSO deployment from a Dynamics 365 
    organization to another. This will not delete anything inside of the
    original Dynamics 365 organization.

6. Use **Delete current deployment** to delete RSO Azure resources. The RSO
    solution will remain, which will not impact anything inside of the Dynamics
    365 organization.

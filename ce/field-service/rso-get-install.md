# Get resource scheduling optimization

There are two ways to get resource scheduling optimization:

- Buy a resource scheduling optimization license
- Request a trial from your local Microsoft representative


## Option 1: Buy a resource scheduling optimization license

In order to get access to resource scheduling optimization, you must first have access to Field Service. If you already have Field Service installed, skip to step 4.   

1. Purchase Field Service. Go to the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** > **Billing > Purchase Services**.
   
2. Find and buy whichever Field Service license works best for you and your organization. Visit the [Field Service pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/#FieldService) for more information. And for even more details, visit the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide (PDF)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&clcid=0x409).   

3. After purchasing, install Dynamics 365 Field Service.
   
   - Go to **Admin Centers** > **Dynamics 365** > **Instances**.
   - Select your instance and choose **Solutions**.
   - Select Field Service and choose install.

4. Purchase resource scheduling optimization. Go to the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** > **Billing** > **Purchase services**. The price of resource scheduling optimization is based on the number of resources whose schedules are optimized.

## Option 2: Request trial

Microsoft employees can request resource scheduling optimization trial environments for themselves or for customers and partners by filling out the [resource scheduling optimization trial environment form](https://aka.ms/rsotrial). If you are a customer or partner, contact your local Microsoft representative.

## Next steps

After purchasing resource scheduling optimization, follow the [resource scheduling optimization deployment steps](./rso-deployment.md).

## Get Resource Scheduling Optimization (RSO)

There are two ways to get Resource Scheduling Optimization (RSO):

- Buy an RSO license
- Request a trial from your local Microsoft representative


## Option 1: Buy RSO

In order to get access to RSO, you must first have access to Field Service. This is achieved by purchasing a Field Service license or a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan license which includes Field Service among other apps.

1. Purchase Field Service. Go to the **Microsoft 365 (Office 365) admin center > Billing > Purchase services**
2. Find and buy at least one Dynamics 365 Field Service OR Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan license (formerly called Plan 1).

# Set up frontline workers in your organization

Frontline workers in Dynamics 365 Field Service are people in your organization who are primarily scheduled for onsite jobs and who use the Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app for their work. Quickly getting frontline workers set up in Field Service is critical in order to ensure they can immediately start fixing problems at customer locations and completing service calls.

Admins can now use a single form to set up frontline workers in their organizations with all the required permissions frontline workers need to quickly get up and running with the Field Service mobile app and be scheduled for work orders. 

With a single form, admins can: 

1. Set up one or more frontline workers in their organization with the appropriate [characteristics (skills and certifications)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/field-service/set-up-characteristics), [territories](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/field-service/set-up-territories), time zone, [security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/field-service/view-user-accounts-security-roles), [field security profiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/field-service/view-user-accounts-security-roles), and [mobile offline profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/field-service/mobile-power-app-system-offline). 
2. View and update the defaulted security role, field security profile, and mobile offline profile set for their frontline workers, which controls the data their frontline workers can see and access. Admins can  update these permissions or add any custom security roles, field security profiles, or mobile offline profile.
3. Automatically send an email to their frontline workers with a link to download the Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app. 

After setting up one or more frontline workers, admins can then:

1. View a list of all of their frontline workers, including names, e-mail addresses, and home addresses. 
2. View and update details for individual frontline workers on the bookable resource form, including their home address, security role, field security profile, and mobile offline profile.

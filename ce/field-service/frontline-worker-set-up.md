# Set up Frontline Workers

Frontline worker setup is critical to field service management. With this functionality, admins can provision new frontline workers into Dynamics 365 Field Service with one single form. Additionally, this reduces the time it takes for admins to complete this process and allows frontline workers to receive access to the Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app quicker.

- Streamlined set up for one or more frontline workers into Dynamics 365 Field Service through a single form. 
- Defaulted Security Role, Field Security Profile, and Mobile Offline Profile for frontline workers. 
- Frontline workers will automatically receive an email to download the Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app.

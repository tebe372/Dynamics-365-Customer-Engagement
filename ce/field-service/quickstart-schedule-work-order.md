# Quickstart: Set up users to create, schedule, and view work orders

In this quickstart, we will walk through the core Field Service scenario of creating and scheduling a work order to resolve a customer's issue.

We will do this in 4 steps:

- **Step 1:** Install Dynamics 365 Field Service
- **Step 2:** Assign Field Service licenses to users
- **Step 3:** Get started with creating frontline workers, customers, and scheduling work orders
- **Step 4:** View the scheduled work order on the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app


## Step 1: Install Dynamics 365 Field Service


You need a Dynamics 365 organization with the Field Service application installed. For more information, see the article on [installing Field Service](install-field-service.md). 


### Verify the Field Service application is installed

Sign in as a system administrator and verify that the Field Service application is listed in the main menu. See the following screenshot for reference. If you don't see Field Service, ensure you are signed in as a system administrator. If you still do not see the app, go to the article on [installing Field Service](install-field-service.md).

## Step 2: Assign Field Service licenses to users

## 1. Set up users

Once you have a Dynamics 365 environment with Field Service, you need to create users to use the application. Many different roles interact with Field Service like system administrators, technicians, dispatchers, service managers, inventory managers, customer service representatives and more.

For this quickstart, we'll create two users:

1. Back-office administrator and dispatcher
2. Technician

Sign into [https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/) as a system administrator.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 apps menu.](./media/quickstart-o365-admin.png)

Go to **Users** and create at least two users. One to represent a back-office administrator and dispatcher, and another to represent a field technician.

Assign each user a license or trial license that includes Dynamics 365 Field Service.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of active users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](./media/quickstart-o365-admin-users.png)

Go to the [Power Apps admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the list of admin centers in the Microsoft 365 admin center.](./media/quickstart-o365-admin-powerapp.png)

Select your environment that has Field Service installed. Select **Settings** > **Users + permissions** > **Users**.

Add the two users you created that have Field Service licenses or trial licenses.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Power Platform admin center, showing the new users.](./media/quickstart-ppac-users-add.png)


## Step 3: Get started with creating frontline workers, customers, and scheduling work orders

## Set up your frontline workers

By the end of this getting started page you will have successfully scheduled a work order to a frontline worker to resolve a customer's issue. 


Start by creating a frontline worker who represents someone in your company who completes work orders. Select the **Set Up** button.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-flw1.png)

In the form that displays, enter required information. Recommended values are prepopulated and should not be changed unless necessary. 


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-flw2.png)

Optionally you can send an email to the frontline worker user to download the mobile app if [mailboxes are set up](frontline-worker-set-up-email-approval.md).

## Create your accounts

Next create an account that represents one of your customers. Select the **Create** button.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-account1.png)


Follow the form to enter relevant information.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-account2.png)

## Create your work orders

Create a work order that outlines work that needs to be done for a customer, typically at the customer's location or at the location of an asset or equipment. Select the **Create** button.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-wo1.png)

 Follow the form to enter relevant information. 
 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-wo2.png)

 The Service Account represents the customer who the work order relates to. 

 Tasks are a checklist of things that need to be done.

 Products are parts that may be needed to complete the work order.

 Services are labor items that may be needed to complete the work order.

## Schedule your work orders

The last step is to schedule the work order to a frontline worker who will complete it for the customer. Select the **Schedule** button to go to the schedule board.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-schedule1.png)

Find your work order in the lower pane and click and drag it to your frontline worker.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-schedule2.png)








## Step 4: View the scheduled work order on the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app

Frontline workers should download the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app from the iOS or Android app stores onto their phone or tablet. 

- [iOS - Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](https://aka.ms/fsmobile-apple)

- [Android - Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](https://aka.ms/fsmobile-google)


Sign in with the username and password of the frontline worker user.

- For the **Username**, enter the username of the technician user. For example, username@org.onmicrosoft.com
- For the **Password**, enter the password you set for the technician.

Select your app in the list.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing the Field Service mobile app.](./media/quickstart-mobile-signin.png)

If you do not see your app, but instead see "Contact your administrator for access to your organization's mobile apps," then select the menu icon and toggle the **Show non-production apps** to _Yes_.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing "Show non-production apps" setting in the Field Service mobile app.](./media/mobile-2020-error-contact-administrator-show-nonproduction-apps.png)

In the **Booking** tab, see the work order you scheduled to your frontline worker. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing the booking on the Field Service mobile app.](./media/quickstart-mobile-work-order.png)


For more information, see the article on [getting started with the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](mobile-power-app-get-started.md).


Congratulations! You have successfully completed the core scenario in Field Service.















## 2. Assign appropriate security roles to your users 

Next we need to assign each user the correct Field Service security role.

Select **Manage users in Dynamics 365**.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you're seeing the "Enabled Users" view.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of environment settings in the Power Platform admin center.](./media/quickstart-ppac-users.png)

Select the user that represents the back-office administrator and dispatcher, then select **Manage Roles** in the top ribbon and assign the **Field Service - Administrator** and **Field Service - Dispatcher** security roles.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the manage user roles dialog in the enabled users view.](./media/quickstart-roles-admin.png)

Then select the user that represents the technician, and assign them the **Field Service - Resource** security role.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the manage user roles dialog in the enabled users view, showing the resource role selected.](./media/quickstart-roles-resource.png)

Now we need to assign Field Security profiles.

Sign into your Dynamics 365 environment. In the top right, select **Advanced settings**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Dynamics 365 showing the advanced settings dropdown menu.](./media/quickstart-advanced-settings.png)

Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Users**.

Select **Field Security Profiles**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Dynamics 365 settings.](./media/quickstart-field-secuirty-profile.png)

Select the  **Field Service â€“ Resource** field security profile and add the technician user.

Field technicians can't edit fields on mobile work orders unless they have this profile assigned.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of field security profiles in Dynamics 365 settings showing the resource profile.](./media/quickstart-field-secuirty-profile-resource.png)

Then select the **Field Service - Administrator** field security profile and add the administrator user.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of field security profiles in Dynamics 365 settings showing the administrator profile.](./media/quickstart-field-secuirty-profile-admin.png)

## 3. Create a bookable resource

Next, create a bookable resource record for the technician user. Creating a bookable resource lets you schedule work orders for the technician, which the technician sees in the mobile app.

Go to **Field Service** > **Resources** > **Resources** > **+New**

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of active bookable resources, showing the "+New" option.](./media/quiickstart-new-bookable-resource.png)

Create a new technician resource with the following settings: 

- Resource Type = **User**
- User = **\[User record that represents your technician user\]**
- Display on Schedule Board = **Yes**
- Enable for Availability Search = **Yes**


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a new bookable resource in Field Service.](./media/quickstart-new-bookable-resource-complete.png)

For more information, see the article on [setting up bookable resources](set-up-bookable-resources.md).

## 4. Create a work order

Go to **Field Service** > **Service** > **Work Orders** > **+New**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the active work orders list in Field Service.](./media/quickstart-work-order-new.png)

At a minimum, enter information in the following required fields.

- For **Service Account**, select an account from the list or create a new one.
- For **Work Order Type**, select a work order type from the list or create a new one. 
- For **System Status**, select **Open-Unscheduled**.
- For **Price List**, select a price list from list or create new one. 
- Set **Taxable** to **No**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a work order in Field Service.](./media/quickstart-work-order-new2.png)

On the **Address** tab, enter a valid address. Then choose **Save and close**.

Consider adding incident types, products, services, and service tasks to add more details and instructions to your work orders. For more information, see the article on [configuring incident types](configure-incident-types.md).

## 5. Add the bookable resource to the schedule board

Next, add the bookable resource to the schedule board.

Go to **Field Service** > **Schedule Board**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board in Field Service.](./media/quickstart-schedule-board-1.png)

In the **Filter and Map View** panel, select **Options** > **Select Resources**.

Find the new technician bookable resource with the **Resource Type** set to **User**, and then move the user to selected resources. Choose **Apply**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the hourly view on the schedule board, showing the new bookable resource.](./media/quickstart-schedule-board-2.png)

## 6. Schedule the work order to the bookable resource

In the lower pane, find the work order to schedule. This work order is listed in the **Unscheduled Work Orders** view. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the hourly view on the schedule board, showing a booking.](./media/quickstart-schedule-board-3.png)

To schedule the work order, drag it to the technician's time slot.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the hourly view on the schedule board, showing the time slot.](./media/quickstart-schedule-board-4.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you don't schedule the work order in the past. There is a blue vertical line that represents the current time. You may need to adjust the time zone of the schedule board by selecting the gear icon in the top right of the schedule board.

## 7. View the scheduled work order on the mobile app

Download the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app from the iOS or Android app stores. For more information, see the article on [installing the mobile app](mobile-power-app-get-started.md).

Sign in with the username and password for the frontline worker user.

- For the **Username**, enter the username of the technician user. For example, username@org.onmicrosoft.com
- For the **Password**, enter the password you set for the technician.

Select your app in the list.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing the Field Service mobile app.](./media/quickstart-mobile-signin.png)

If you do not see your app, but instead see "Contact your administrator for access to your organization's mobile apps," then select the menu icon and toggle the **Show non-production apps** to _Yes_.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing "Show non-production apps" setting in the Field Service mobile app.](./media/mobile-2020-error-contact-administrator-show-nonproduction-apps.png)

In the **Booking** tab, see the work order you scheduled to your frontline worker. You must be signed in with the user the frontline worker was created for in step 3.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing the booking on the Field Service mobile app.](./media/quickstart-mobile-work-order.png)

# Quickstart: Set up users to create, schedule, and view work orders

In this quickstart, we will walk through the core Field Service scenario of creating and scheduling a work order to resolve a customer's issue.

We will do this in 4 steps:

- **Step 1:** Install Dynamics 365 Field Service
- **Step 2:** Assign Field Service licenses to users
- **Step 3:** Get started with creating frontline workers, customers, and scheduling work orders
- **Step 4:** View the scheduled work order on the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app


## Step 1: Install Dynamics 365 Field Service


You need a Dynamics 365 organization with the Field Service application installed. For more information, see the article on [installing Field Service](install-field-service.md). 


### Verify the Field Service application is installed

Sign in as a system administrator and verify that the Field Service application is listed in the main menu. See the following screenshot for reference. If you don't see Field Service, ensure you are signed in as a system administrator. If you still do not see the app, go to the article on [installing Field Service](install-field-service.md).

## Step 2: Assign Field Service licenses to users

Once you have a Dynamics 365 environment with Field Service, you need to create users to use the application. Many different roles interact with Field Service like system administrators, technicians, dispatchers, service managers, inventory managers, customer service representatives and more.

For this quickstart, we'll create two users:

1. Back-office administrator and dispatcher
2. Technician

Sign into [https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/) as a system administrator.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 apps menu.](./media/quickstart-o365-admin.png)

Go to **Users** and create at least two users. One to represent a back-office administrator and dispatcher, and another to represent a frontline worker.

Assign each user a license or trial license that includes Dynamics 365 Field Service.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of active users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](./media/quickstart-o365-admin-users.png)

Go to the [Power Apps admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the list of admin centers in the Microsoft 365 admin center.](./media/quickstart-o365-admin-powerapp.png)

Select your environment that has Field Service installed. Select **Settings** > **Users + permissions** > **Users**.

Add the two users you created if they are not already added.

## Step 3: Get started with creating frontline workers, customers, and scheduling work orders

### Set up your frontline workers

By the end of this getting started page you will have successfully scheduled a work order to a frontline worker to resolve a customer's issue. 


Start by creating a frontline worker who represents someone in your company who completes work orders. Select the **Set Up** button.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-flw1.png)

In the form that displays, enter required information. Recommended values are prepopulated and should not be changed unless necessary. 


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-flw2.png)

Optionally you can send an email to the frontline worker user to download the mobile app if [mailboxes are set up](frontline-worker-set-up-email-approval.md).

### Create your accounts

Next create an account that represents one of your customers. Select the **Create** button.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-account1.png)


Follow the form to enter relevant information.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-account2.png)

### Create your work orders

Create a work order that outlines work that needs to be done for a customer, typically at the customer's location or at the location of an asset or equipment. Select the **Create** button.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-wo1.png)

 Follow the form to enter relevant information. 
 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-wo2.png)

- The Service Account represents the customer who the work order relates to. 
- Tasks are a checklist of things that need to be done.
- Products are parts that may be needed to complete the work order.
- Services are labor items that may be needed to complete the work order.

### Schedule your work orders

The last step is to schedule the work order to a frontline worker who will complete it for the customer. Select the **Schedule** button to go to the schedule board.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-schedule1.png)

Find your work order in the lower pane and click and drag it to your frontline worker.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-schedule2.png)



## Step 4: View the scheduled work order on the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app

Frontline workers should download the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app from the iOS or Android app stores onto their phone or tablet. 

- [iOS - Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](https://aka.ms/fsmobile-apple)

- [Android - Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](https://aka.ms/fsmobile-google)


Sign in with the username and password of the frontline worker user.

- For the **Username**, enter the username of the frontline worker user. For example, username@org.onmicrosoft.com
- For the **Password**, enter the password you set for the frontline worker.

Select your app in the list.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing the Field Service mobile app.](./media/quickstart-mobile-signin.png)

If you do not see your app, but instead see "Contact your administrator for access to your organization's mobile apps," then select the menu icon and toggle the **Show non-production apps** to _Yes_.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing "Show non-production apps" setting in the Field Service mobile app.](./media/mobile-2020-error-contact-administrator-show-nonproduction-apps.png)

In the **Booking** tab, see the work order you scheduled to your frontline worker. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing the booking on the Field Service mobile app.](./media/quickstart-mobile-work-order.png)


For more information, see the article on [getting started with the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](mobile-power-app-get-started.md).


Congratulations! You have successfully completed the core scenario in Field Service.




















## 6. Schedule the work order to the bookable resource

In the lower pane, find the work order to schedule. This work order is listed in the **Unscheduled Work Orders** view. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the hourly view on the schedule board, showing a booking.](./media/quickstart-schedule-board-3.png)

To schedule the work order, drag it to the technician's time slot.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the hourly view on the schedule board, showing the time slot.](./media/quickstart-schedule-board-4.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you don't schedule the work order in the past. There is a blue vertical line that represents the current time. You may need to adjust the time zone of the schedule board by selecting the gear icon in the top right of the schedule board.

## 7. View the scheduled work order on the mobile app

Download the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app from the iOS or Android app stores. For more information, see the article on [installing the mobile app](mobile-power-app-get-started.md).

Sign in with the username and password for the frontline worker user.

- For the **Username**, enter the username of the technician user. For example, username@org.onmicrosoft.com
- For the **Password**, enter the password you set for the technician.

Select your app in the list.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing the Field Service mobile app.](./media/quickstart-mobile-signin.png)

If you do not see your app, but instead see "Contact your administrator for access to your organization's mobile apps," then select the menu icon and toggle the **Show non-production apps** to _Yes_.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device renders showing "Show non-production apps" setting in the Field Service mobile app.](./media/mobile-2020-error-contact-administrator-show-nonproduction-apps.png)

In the **Booking** tab, see the work order you scheduled to your frontline worker. You must be signed in with the user the frontline worker was created for in step 3.

# Set up a Dynamics 365 Field Service trial

=============
MORE INFO HERE ABOUT TRIALS.DYNAMICS.COM 

ALSO NEED TO UPDATE THIS TOPIC WITH CURRENT INFO WITH A WAY TO REPLICATE A NEW PERSON SIGNING UP FOR FIELD SERVICE TRIAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS ASSUMES AN EXISTING D365 ORG ALREADY, SO WE CAN JUST JUMP IN. THESE STEPS NEED UPDATING.
=============


1. Using system administrator credentials, sign in to the Dynamics 365 organization.

2. Go to **Settings** > **Microsoft AppSource**. Search for **field service trial**, select **Dynamics 365 Field Service trial**, and then select **Free Trial**.

3. In the **Organization to add the application to** drop-down list, select the Dynamics 365 organization name. Review the terms and conditions, and then select **Agree**. Installation may take several minutes.

You should then be ready to follow the further installation and setup instructions in [the installation topic](install-field-service.md).

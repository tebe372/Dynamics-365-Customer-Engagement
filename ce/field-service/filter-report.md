# Apply filters to reports

By default, the data set for a report is fairly broad. You can apply filters to a report to focus on the information that matters to you.

## Add and update filters on a report

You can filter reports by the following criteria: 

- **Customer** 
- **System status**
- **Work order type**
- **Substatus**
- **Service territory**
- **Technician**
- **Date range**

See the following screenshot of the work order summary report for reference.

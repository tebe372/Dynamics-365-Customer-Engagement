# IoT partner integrations

Dynamics 365 Field Service is designed to streamline and optimize field service operations for organizations. One of the key strengths of Field Service is the ability to integrate with partner solutions, enabling organizations to extend functionality and enhance their field service operations. Integrations enable businesses to use specialized tools, technologies, and industry-specific applications to meet their unique needs.

Field Service allows seamless integration with IoT-enabled devices from any IoT vendor through [custom IoT providers](cfs-custom-iot-provider.md).

This page highlights partners that have integrated their IoT solutions with Field Service. Customers can connect these partner solutions to their Field Service implementation. Connecting the solutions enables alignment of assets between the two solutions. Configure IoT alerts or receive work orders from the partner solution directly in Field Service.  

Integrations also enable seamless sharing of critical insights like equipment health and faults within Field Service. They empower frontline workers to make informed decisions based on device data when providing services and repairs.

The following partners have integrated their IoT solutions with Field Service.

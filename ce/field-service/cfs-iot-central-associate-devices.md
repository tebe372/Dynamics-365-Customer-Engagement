# 2 - Associate devices with customer accounts 

If an IoT device isn't associated with a customer account in Connected Field Service, the system will not be able to generate work orders or cases against incoming alerts. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to associate a device with a customer account. While customer accounts are an optional association in Azure IoT Central, they are required in Connected Field Service.

## Goals

Associate a device in Connected Field Service with a customer account so that work orders or cases can be generated against incoming IoT alerts.

## Steps

1. In your Connected Field Service application, navigate to the device page you wish to associate with a customer account. You can find this under "Devices" in the left-side menu.

2. On the Active Device page, select the dropdown just to the right of "Active IoT Devices" and select the view, "IoT devices without customer account." Select one of these devices.

3. On the device detail page, start typing the name of the customer account in the "Account" field.

    a. For the purposes of this tutorial, you can select "Active Transport Inc."

4. Save the changes you've made (the Save button is in the bottom corner of your window).

## See the results

This device will now be associated with a customer account, and can receive IoT alerts from Azure IoT Central.

 **Work order management**  
  
 Quickly generate work orders, encompassing all of the information you need to dispatch field agents to service locations.  
  
 **Schedule board and dispatch**  
  
 A flexible drag-and-drop schedule board lets dispatchers assign resources and set up schedules for multiple work orders using a list or map view.  
  
 **Resource management**  
  
 Configure resource information to allow [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)] to efficiently match the best field agent to a work order based on availability, proximity to service location, and required skills.  
  
 **Service locations and customer assets**  
  
 Store and manage information about your customersâ€™ service locations and serviceable customer assets.  
  
 **Preventative maintenance**  
  
 Configure service agreements for your customers that will automatically generate recurring work orders to ensure equipment is properly maintained before issues occur.  
  
 **Inventory management**  
  
 Extend the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] product catalog with an inventory management system that tracks real-time inventory levels by warehouse, including mobile truck stock.  
  
 **Customer billing**  
  
 Completed work orders can be turned into customer invoices for customer billing.  
  
 **Mobile app**  
  
 The mobile app gives field techs quick and easy access to everything they need to execute a work order, including schedule information, customer contact information, turn by directions, and more.

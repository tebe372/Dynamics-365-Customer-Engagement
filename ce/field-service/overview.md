# Welcome to Dynamics 365 for Field Service 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

## What is the Field Service business application?

Dynamics 365 for Field Service supports the methods of managing a mobile workforce and delivering products and services to your customers' locations.

Field Service enables you to send the right resources, with the right skill sets, to the right customer location, at the right time, and provide your resources with the right technology to fulfill the job requirements.

## Examples of Field Service implementations

- An MRI manufacturer sells MRI machines to hospitals and clinics and provides maintenance services over the lifetime of the machine.
- A fiber optic cable utility company must respond to outages by dispatching technicians to problem areas.
- A provider of in-home healthcare services schedules and dispatches healthcare workers to multiple patients each day to administer medicine and other care.
- A facilities manager provides maintenance and repair services for heating and cooling equipment.

## Why you need Field Service in your business

Field Service anticipates and solves the most common onsite scenarios. 

According to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-3KXDGG5&ct=161028&st=sb"), in 2020, two out of three large field service organizations will equip field technicians with a mobile application that drives profitability by creating revenue streams, efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Gartner also say that through 2020, 80% of organizations with more than 75 field technicians will miss more than 20% of the planned efficiency gains due to incomplete integration or deployment.

The [Aberdeen Group](http://www.aberdeen.com/about) said: “65% of incoming service requests require a field visit or dispatch. Nearly 26% of these dispatches require secondary or additional follow-up visits, thereby making the effective management of field resources and the overall field service organization extremely vital in the pursuit of service excellence.”

## Elements of Field Service

Field service capabilities extend Dynamics 365 to provide a complete management solution, including service locations, customer assets, preventative maintenance, work order management, resource management, product inventory, scheduling and dispatch, mobility, collaboration, customer billing, and analytics. 

Here’s what it can do for you:

### **Work orders** 
- Define service work to be performed primarily but not exclusively at your customers’ locations.

### **Schedule and dispatch**
- Manage resources used for service including people and equipment
- Schedule and dispatch resources to customer locations
- Optimize service schedules with efficient routing, resource skill matching, and reduced travel time.

### **Communication and notifications**
- Enhance communication and collaboration between customer service, dispatch, field technicians, customers, and other stakeholders.

### **Mobility**
- Guide resources through schedule changes and service work with an easy-to-use mobile application.

### **Asset Management**
- Help manage customer assets and service history.

### **Preventative maintenance**
- Manage recurring maintenance for specific equipment at customers’ locations.

### **Inventory,** **purchasing** **& returns**
- Manage truck stock, purchase order requests and fulfillment, and product returns.

### **Billing**
- Generate invoices based on products and services delivered to customers.

### **Time keeping**
- Understand how resources are spending their time traveling, on break, working, etc.

### **Analytics**
- Understand data flowing from work orders, scheduling activities, and customer interactions.

## Typical user profiles

**Customer Service Representative** Identifies incoming requests and qualifies them as work orders requiring onsite visits. Primarily uses the application via the web browser.

**Dispatcher** Reviews work orders, prepares them for scheduling, and assigns them to the most appropriate resources with scheduling tools such as the schedule board (manually), resource availability search (semi-automated), and resource scheduling optimization (fully automated). Primarily uses the application via the web browser.

**Field technician** Receives his or her assigned work orders and travels to customer locations to perform maintenance and repairs. Primarily uses the application via a mobile phone/tablet on iOS, Android, or Windows devices.

**Inventory Manager** Ensures field technicians have inventory to perform service calls, manages product returns and purchases new inventory. Primarily uses the application via the web browser.

**Service Manager** Tracks metrics regarding customer satisfaction and resource utilization and looks for ways to promote standardization and efficiency. Primarily uses the application via the web browser.

## How does the solution improve an organization’s service delivery?
- Better issue triage.
- Centralized schedule board updated in real time.
- Optimized scheduling to appropriate technicians.
- Automatic notifications to stakeholders.
- Ensuring technicians have information and parts to complete on site visits.
- Set up of smart preventative maintenance schedules.
- Standardization and measurement of onsite visits.

## What are the most common outcomes for an organization? 

- Improved first time fix rate.
- More service calls per technician per week.
- Better management of follow up work and realization of upsell and cross sell opportunities.
- Reduced travel time, mileage and vehicle wear and tear.
- Organized tracking of customer issues and resolutions.

## What does this mean for the customers?

- An accurate arrival time is communicated to the customer.
- The customer interacts with a field technician that looks professional, is organized, and can speak to account and equipment history.
- The customer is updated with the status of the job and the eventual resolution.
- Onsite visits are scheduled when convenient for the customer.
- Customer disappointment from equipment downtime is avoided through preventative maintenance.

## How is Microsoft’s Field Service solution unique?

Unlike other field service software providers, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service sits on top of a comprehensive business application platform. This has many advantages. First, it allows Field Service to sit in context of other business applications such as sales automation, customer service, project management, etc. This makes cross-department/cross-team collaboration easier and helps achieve better analytics of operations and data.

Second, the Dynamics platform has advanced workflow tools that allow for sophisticated automation within Field Service and between Field Service and other solutions. Field service solutions that sit outside of a platform tend to have limited automation capabilities which means more manual work will be needed. 

Finally, perhaps the greatest strength of a field service solution on a world class business application platform, is a vibrant partner ecosystem and app store. This means thousands of developers and consultants extend and augment the Microsoft Field Service solution by submitting add-ons that can be downloaded from the [Dynamics app store](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?product=dynamics-365%3Bdynamics-365-for-field-services&page=1).

Beyond field service on the Dynamics platform, another advantage is how Dynamics 365 for Field Service interacts with other Microsoft products and platforms. In terms of Azure, this means Field Service data can be fed into Azure Machine learning to make better use of data. A simple example being recommending solutions to field technicians based on previous work or Azure cognitive services detecting issues in pictures submitted by customers. 

In terms of Office 365, this means field service workers can use Skype, Teams, Outlook, and Excel seamlessly in context with field service work.

## Scenarios supported by Field Service

Field Service can support any scenario where resources need to be managed to satisfy customers’ work requirements. With Field Service, an organization can:

- Maintain customer billing accounts and service accounts

- Automatically build and manage customer scopes of work with many potential variations:
- Work to be done by a single resource, within a given day.
- Work to be done by a group of resources (human or equipment) over one or more days.
- Define parameters to ensure that some work can only be done by certain resources (characteristics) and can define resources who should not be considered to do the work (excluded resources).
- Define work that must be performed at a specified geographic location, at a service depot, or work that can be done remotely, regardless of location.
- Define a required set of skills, characteristics, and efficiencies that a resource must possess to be qualified to perform the work.
- Drive creation of an estimated duration to complete tasks and work.
- Include estimated parts and labor line items, as well as a list of expected tasks to complete.
- Define a set of resources (human or non-human) with specific working hours, skills; and starting and ending location.
- Schedule resources based on defined work orders, matching on availability, territory, location, distance, skills etc.
- Manage and track inventory required for work orders and the movement of parts from order to inventory to installation at a site.
- Enable field resources to interact with key data in real-time using the Field Service mobile application across any form factor or operating system.

## Business processes not supported by Field Service

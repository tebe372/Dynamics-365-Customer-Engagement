# Build your own Connected Field Service (IoT) solution

This article provides an overview how to get started integrating IoT data with Dynamics 365 for Field Service to build your own Connected Field Service solution.

## What is Connected Field Service?
The Connected Field Service solution harnesses data from an IoT platform into the Dynamics 365 for Field Service app to help organizations proactively detect, troubleshoot, and resolve issues remotely, dispatching a technician only when necessary. This enables you to shift from costly scheduled maintenance plans to just-in-time predictive maintenance.   

Connected Field Service helps you:  

- Reduce downtime by automatically creating work orders and dispatching the right technician for the job based on anomalies flagged in your IoT data  

- Improve customer service by addressing issues as soon as they arise, before your customers become aware of the issues 

## What you need to start building your own Connected Field Service solution

Getting started requires three things:  
- Dynamics 365 for Field Service with system administrator credentials 

  You'll need a Dynamics 365 for Field Service tenant so that you can import your IoT solution on top of it.  You'll build an IoT app within that Field Service tenant.  

New to Field Service and need a tenant? [No worries. Sign up for a free trial for development purposes.](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.40fd37ef-dca4-4b0d-9f41-d16703b7d070
)

- Azure subscription with admin credentials     

  The Azure IoT services you'll deploy must be associated with an Azure subscription.

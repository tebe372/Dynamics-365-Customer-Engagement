# What is the latest version of the mobile app and related Woodford version?

With the Fall 2018 Field Service release, a new mobile app was released called **Field Service Mobile**. The latest version of **Field Service Mobile** generally available is **11.2**. 

To see your mobile app's version number, find the About menu item, and select it. You'll find the version number here.

>[!Note]
> You can download the latest version of Woodford and simply publish to a previous version that is compatible. For example, a Woodford version of 11.3 should be published down to version 11.2 if the Field Service Mobile app is version 11.2.

To find your installed Woodford solution version number, open a non-private Internet Explorer window and navigate to **Settings > Woodford > MobileCRM Woodford**.

You can find the published version number by navigating to **Mobile projects**, as seen in the below screenshot. **Note**: the published Woodford version can't exceed your mobile app version.

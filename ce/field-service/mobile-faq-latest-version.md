# What is the latest version of the mobile app and related Woodford version?

The latest version of the Field Service Mobile (2017) app is 9.1, which corresponds to Woodford version 9.1.

To see your mobile app's version number, find the About menu item, and select it. You'll find the version number here.

After the October 2018 Field Service release, the mobile app will be updated to 11.1 and will correspond to Woodford version 11.1.

>[!Note]
> You can download the latest version of Woodford and simply publish to a previous version that is compatible. For example, the org in the screenshots below has Woodford 11.1 installed, but the mobile project is published to 9.1 to accommodate the 9.1 release of Field Service mobile (2017). This is useful because when Field Service 11.1 is released, you will not need to update Woodford.

To find your installed Woodford solution version number, open a non-private Internet Explorer window and navigate to **Settings > Woodford > MobileCRM Woodford**.

You can find the published version number by navigating to **Mobile projects**, as seen in the below screenshot. **Note**: the published Woodford version can't exceed your mobile app version. So, if you're using the mobile app version 9.1, you must publish your Woodford mobile project with version 9.1.

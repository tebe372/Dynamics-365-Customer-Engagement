>[!Note]
> **Pro Tip:** You can download the latest version of Woodford and simply publish to a previous version that is compatible. As an example, the org in the picture below has Woodford 11.1 installed but the mobile project is published to 9.1 to accommodate the 9.1 release of the Field Service mobile (2017). This is advantageous because when Field Service 11.1 is released you will not need to update Woodford.

To view your Woodford solution version, in a non-private Internet Explorer navigate to **Settings > Woodford > MobileCRM Woodford**

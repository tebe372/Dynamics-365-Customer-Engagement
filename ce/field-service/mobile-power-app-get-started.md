# Install and set up the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app

The Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app is designed and optimized for technicians to view Dynamics 365 Field Service work orders, customer assets, accounts, and contacts. This mobile app is built on Microsoft Power Platform as a [model-driven app](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview) and is customizable to your business needs with the same admin console as all Dynamics 365 business apps.

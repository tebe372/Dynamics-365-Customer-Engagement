# Set up notifications for the Field Service Portal (preview)

## Prerequisites

- Field Service version (8.8.30.103+)
- SMS provider supporting the Power Automate connector for mobile SMS communication
- Office 365 Exchange account for email communications

## Step 2: Configure email and SMS connectors within Power Automate

Customers will be able to access their service portal with a unique link sent to their email or as a text message. To set this up, you'll need to configure one or both communication methods.

We provide a links directly to the Power Automate Flows for Email and SMS via Field Service [Customer Portal Settings](#step-3-set-up-the-customer-experience)

Alternately, you can access the Power Automate Flows for Email and SMS within Power Automate:

Go to https://make.powerapps.com > **Solutions**. Select **Dynamics 365 Field Service PowerApps Portal – Flow** in the list.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of of Power Apps showing the list of solutions with "Dynamics 365 Field Service PowerApps Portal – Flow" selected.](./media/03_PAFlow_Solution.jpg)

Here you'll find three Power Automate flows. Email and SMS flows are off by default, so we'll need to configure both in order to enable them. 

 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Power Apps showing the list of available flows in the "Dynamics 365 Field Service PowerApps Portal – Flow" solution.](./media/02_PAFlow_Flows.jpg)

>[!Note]
> Exchange and Twilio are used here by default as popular providers. You can substitute an alternate connector by cloning the flows and configuring desired connector.

To configure email:

- Select **Field Service PowerApps Power Flow Email Notification**, which will open the flow in a new tab.
- With the Flow open, select **Edit**.
- Select the **Send an Email** Exchange connector.
- Add your Office 365 Exchange account connection.
- Save and **Turn On** the flow.

To configure SMS:

- Select **Field Service PowerApps Power Flow SMS Notification**, which will open the flow in a new tab.
- With the Flow open, select **Edit**.
- Select the Twilio connector.
- Add your Twilio account details.
- Save and **Turn On** the flow.

### How do I edit email and SMS content?

General content and format of the notifications are following a fixed template and cannot be changed. You can update individual words within the email and SMS content with content snippets found in Field Service settings. 

### Notifications

After configuring your portal and enabling notifications, emails and SMS messages will be sent to the **Reported By** contact associated with work orders. When the **Reported By** contact is not defined, notifications will be sent to the contact based on the **Send Messages To** value under (**Settings**)[#general-and-notification-settings]. By default, this is the primary contact on the account record.

Messages are automatically generated by the following events:

- **Booking Reminder**: Reminder messages are sent within *7* days of the scheduled service time. This message will carry the scheduled service time and a link to your portal with basic details including confirmation of service account location shown on a map.
  - By default, service reminders will be scheduled to send daily at 10:00 AM UTC for any bookings within your configured time period. This time can be adjusted in Power Automate. For more information, see this section: [How do I change the timing of reminder messages](#how-do-i-change-the-timing-of-reminder-message)?

- **Technician Traveling**: Sent when the booking status is *Traveling*. This message communicates estimated time of arrival while considering traffic on expected route. This message links to your customer portal with a map, so your customer can see progress to your service location.

> The booking confirmation notifications are relavent only to the [self-service scheduling](scheduling-self-customers.md) scenario, and are not avialable with the track my technician functionality.



### Notification settings

Notification settings provide a read-only view of all messages sent to customers. Here you can see which customers have received a message, the type of message, and the state of the message.

### How do I change the timing of reminder messages?

Reminder messages are triggered by a flow that runs daily at 10:00 AM UTC. Any bookings that fall into your reminder message time period, and aren't part of exclusion lists, will receive a reminder message.

**To edit the reminder message**

1. Go to https://make.powerapps.com > **Solutions** and find the solution **Dynamics 365 Field Service PowerApps Portal – Flow**.
1. Edit the flow named **Create notification items for bookings**.
1. Find the location recurrence connector, and set the **Flow Recurrence** value to the time you want.

### I don't have a Twilio or Office 365 Exchange account. Are there other services I can use for messaging?

Yes, you can use alterative SMS or email providers as long as they have connectors supported by Power Automate. Clone the existing email and SMS flows, remove the current connectors, and add desired connectors.ange the timing of reminder message?

# Resource Crews for Field Service

Field Service utilizes the **Universal Resource Scheduling** solution to schedule crews to perform onsite Work Orders either via manual scheduling or the schedule assistant. 

The most common scenario is scheduling multiple employees, contractors, and equipment to arrive onsite at the same time traveling from various locations.

Find out more about resource crews on the [Universal Resource Scheduling Docs site](../common-scheduler/crews.md).

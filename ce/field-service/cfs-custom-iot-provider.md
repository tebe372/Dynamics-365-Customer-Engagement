# Extensible IoT data sources for Connected Field Service

The IoT providers feature in Connected Field Service (CFS) allows different IoT vendors to seamlessly integrate their device capabilities within the Field Service experience. For example, IoT alerts can appear in the same list, regardless of where the alerts originated. When you select the **Pull Device Data** button on an IoT device record, CFS looks up the provider of the device and routes the command appropriately to the corresponding IoT system. This action allows users to interact with IoT devices in a consistent way, regardless of the underlying provider.

By default, CFS uses this IoT providers feature to integrate with Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Central. Now this feature is available for developers and independent software vendors (ISVs) to build their own IoT provider model, integrating any IoT provider with CFS. ISVs can also publish their custom IoT provider as a solution in [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) for easier distribution and usage by customers.

## When to use custom IoT providers

You should consider using a custom IoT provider:

- If you're using an IoT system from a vendor that doesn’t use Azure IoT.
- When you use multiple Azure IoT Hub instances or Azure IoT Central applications, connected to a common CFS organization.
- If you have multiple IoT vendors that you need to manage in a single CFS organization. For example, your organization’s HVAC alerts and devices may be handled by Azure IoT, while your organization’s security alerts may be handled by a different IoT system. While the alerts from both systems come into the same instance, CFS can route the actions to the appropriate system based on the configured providers.

## Prerequisites

- Development experience in model-driven apps that connect to Dynamics 365 and Common Data Service. For more information, see the [overview on model-driven apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/overview).
- Programming experience with C#, .NET, and Visual Studio.
- Knowledge of REST/OData API.

## Architecture and entity model

The following diagram offers a quick glimpse of the IoT provider entity model and its relationship across various entities in Connected Field Service. Let’s review each of these entities and how they could be used in your custom IoT provider.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Diagram showing the architecture and entity model.](./media/custom-iot-entity-model.png)

### IoT provider entity

This new entity is for identifying various IoT providers and their associated actions for various supported actions. For example, you’d have one record of this entity for Azure IoT Suite (Hub and components) and one for Azure IoT Central. The list of supported actions is covered in following sections in this article.

By default, this entity is not available in sitemap out-of-the-box. It will usually be included as part of a solution installation, but you can also access it through advanced find.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the IoT hub provider entity in Dynamics 365.](./media/custom-iot-hub-provider.png)

### IoT provider instance entity

As shown in the diagram, the IoT provider instance is the organization's instance of the provider. For example, if your CFS organization is connected to two different Azure IoT hub applications, then you’ll have two IoT provider instance records, one for each of your IoT hub applications. You can see the list of IoT provider instances within your Field Service app by going to **Settings** > **IoT** > **Providers**.

You'll find the following fields on the entity:

- **Provider Instance ID**: Indicates the identifier within your source IoT system. For example, this could be your application's ID in Azure IoT Central.
- **URL**: A URL that could be used in your provider code or the user experience. For example, it could be an API endpoint or a link to Azure resource group of the deployment.

> ![Screenshot of an IoT provider instance in Field Service.](./media/custom-iot-provider-instance.png)

### IoT device

In the IoT device entity included in the Connected Field Service, we’ve added the IoT provider instance mapping, so each device can be uniquely associated with a provider instance.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of an IoT device screen in Field Service.](./media/custom-iot-device.png)

### IoT settings

The IoT settings entity now has an option to choose a default IoT provider instance; when populated, all new IoT devices will use this default provider. Users can always switch the provider instance for devices.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the IoT settings in Field Service.](./media/custom-iot-settings.png)

## Supported actions

When you create a custom IoT provider, you'll specify a set of actions associated with that providers. Actions in Dynamics 365 are custom code that will run when you invoke them. For more information, see [this article on custom actions in Dynamics 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/custom-actions).

For example, if you specify ```msdyn_MockProviderPullDeviceDataAction``` as the action for "Pull device data" in your provider, CFS will look for an action with the name ```msdyn_MockProviderPullDeviceDataAction``` and run that action's code when a user clicks the **Pull device data** button on the asset or device form or views in Connected Field Service.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the IoT settings in Field Service.](./media/custom-iot-provider-fields.png)

When a user invokes any of these actions, Connected Field Service will check which IoT provider is associated to the device, and call the custom action on the provider record. It's important that these custom actions use the precise input and output parameters expressed below.

In your code for the action, be sure to connect to your underlying IoT system API or data source to retrieve the resulting output from the IoT devices.

> [!Note]
> Only synchronous actions are supported with custom IoT providers.

### Pull device data action

This action is to get the latest device data from the IoT provider. The action could be used for getting data for a single device or a collection of devices.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of an IoT device in Field Service, with emphasis on the pull data option.](./media/custom-iot-pull-data.png)

This action supports multiple devices, so the input needs to be sent as an **EntityCollection**. The following table shows the parameters for the entity collection for this action.

### Register device action

The register device action registers a device that is present in CFS with the IoT provider. This action is commonly used when a technician swaps out an asset or one of its device components and needs the new device to be registered with the IoT provider. The action could be used for registering a single device or a collection of devices.

Here are the input parameters for this action. Since this action supports multiple devices, the parameters need to be sent as **EntityCollection**.

### Device Readings – Events

The device readings control in Connected Field Service also allows IoT Providers to plot discrete events from service history, such as the creation and closure of work orders, scheduled start and end of bookings, and much more. For example, the following screenshot shows the out-of-the-box work order events as "pins" at the bottom of the chart. You do not need to create a **new** action. Rather, you can register a custom plugin on the ```msdyn_IoTGetDeviceEvents``` action, similar to how you can create plugins for create events. 

For more information, see the [article on events in CDS](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/event-framework).

Here are the output parameters for this event.

| JSON properties  | Type   | Details                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EventsName        | string | Short description for the category of events. This description will be displayed in the device readings control allowing users to enable and disable events under that event name. For example, you can categorize events into Asset Events and Service events. Users will see two rows of pins on the device readings chart and can enable and disable either row.             |
| Timestamp            | string | Discrete timestamp of the event formatted as a string in ISO format. This will be the x-axis timestamp for the event pin. For example: "2019-08-07T19:14:53Z"                      |
| Color                | string | The color code of the event as a hex-code string. This will be the color of the pin for this event within the chart. For example: "#FF6300"                                        |
| Description          | string | Short description for the event. This description will be displayed when the user hovers over the pin or when the user selects the pin to see the details dialog.                |
| ID                   | string | The ID value of the event can be name or user-friendly value that can be identified by end user. For example, this could be the work order number, booking confirmation code, etc. |
| Entity               | string | CDS entity name related to the event. For example: "msdyn_workorder"                                                                                                            |
| url                  | string | URL for navigating to additional details of the event. For example, this could be a link to the work order form for additional details on the work order. If you do not pass in a URL, but do pass in an entity and GUID, a hyperlink will be automaticaLly generated that lets users open the record.                            |
| guid                 | string | Guid (converted as a string) that indicates the identifier of the entity record within CDS.                                                                                          |

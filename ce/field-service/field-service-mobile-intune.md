# Manage Field Service Mobile with Microsoft Intune



what is it

Intune mobile application management refers to the suite of Intune management features that lets you publish, push, configure, secure, monitor, and update mobile apps for your users. 

Mobile Application Management (MAM) with Intune gives organizations the ability to set app restriction policies at the app level for use . Intune’s MAM capabilities enable IT to help protect corporate data with the policies that restrict data leakage such as “Cut/Copy/Paste/Save As”, provide encryption at rest, enforce application access and compliance, and remove corporate data at the application level.

why is it helpful
Leverage your Intune enabled infrastructure to manage and protect organizational data within the Field Service Mobile Application. 
BYOD
With an Intune enabled Field Service Mobile app, IT administrators can:
- Add and assign your Field Service Mobile app to user groups and devices, including users in specific groups, devices in specific groups, and more.
- Configure the Field Service Mobile app to start or run with specific settings enabled, and update your existing app when already on the device.
- See reports and track app usage.


We’ll be part of this list of apps soon:

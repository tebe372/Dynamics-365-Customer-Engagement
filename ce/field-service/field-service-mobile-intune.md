# Manage Field Service Mobile with Microsoft Intune

## What is Mobile Application Management (MAM)?
Mobile Application Management (MAM) is software that enables IT administrators to apply and enforce corporate policies on mobile apps. One MAM option for IT administrators is [Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/apps/app-management) that offers a suite of features that let you publish, push, configure, secure, monitor, and update mobile apps including Field Service Mobile, which you will find in a [list of Microsoft apps that are commonly used with Intune](https://aka.ms/mamenabledapps).

## Why is MAM important to Field Service organizations?

MAM is important to Field Service organizations whose technicians use Field Service Mobile primarily because:

1. BYOD 
2. Sensitive information on the go

what is it
 
protect corporate data with the policies that restrict data leakage such as “Cut/Copy/Paste/Save As”, provide encryption at rest, enforce application access and compliance, and remove corporate data at the application level.

why is it helpful
Leverage your Intune enabled infrastructure to manage and protect organizational data within the Field Service Mobile Application. 
BYOD
With an Intune enabled Field Service Mobile app, IT administrators can:
- Add and assign your Field Service Mobile app to user groups and devices, including users in specific groups, devices in specific groups, and more.
- Configure the Field Service Mobile app to start or run with specific settings enabled, and update your existing app when already on the device.
- See reports and track app usage.
limit the sharing of corporate data among apps


We’ll be part of this list of apps soon:

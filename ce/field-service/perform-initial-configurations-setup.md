# Perform initial configurations in Dynamics 365 Field Service

After installing Dynamics 365 Field Service, there are a few important initial configurations, whether you're using the application for learning, development, testing, demonstrations, or live usage.

Estimated Duration: 10 minutes

## Prerequisites

1. A Dynamics 365 environment with the Field Service app installed.  
2. Verify you can sign into Dynamics 365 with a **system administrator** security role.

See below for common prerequisite troubleshooting questions.

### Make sure the Field Service application is installed

Sign in as a system administrator and verify that the Field Service application is listed in the main menu. See the following screenshot for reference. If you don't see Field Service, ensure you are signed in as a system administrator. If you still don't see the app, go to the article on [installing Field Service](install-field-service.md).

## Step 1: Resource scheduling

### Scheduling parameters

First, you need to enable mapping and location services for the application. Maps and locations are important in Field Service because knowing the location of work orders and resources allows the solution to effectively route the closest field technician (resource) to the service request (work order).

This is all accomplished by **geocoding**, where the solution associates a latitude and longitude to an address.

> ![Screenshot showing settings for scheduling parameters](media/quickstart-apps-rs.png) 

Go to **Resource Scheduling app** > **Administration** > **Scheduling Parameters**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of settings](media/quickstart-rs-settings.png) 

Set **Connect to Maps** to **Yes**.

> [!Note]
> In Field Service version 8.8.10.44+ the Bing Maps API key is hidden.

Save and close.

> [!Important]
> By connecting to a mapping service, you are allowing the system to share your data, including but not limited to addresses and coordinates, with external systems outside of your Microsoft Dynamics 365 environment. (Mapping service refers to Bing Maps or other third-party mapping service designated by you or your operating system). This also applies to Government Cloud environments. Your use of the mapping service will also be subject to their separate terms of use. Data imported from such external systems into Microsoft Dynamics 365 are subject to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

For information on enabling maps for the work order form, see the article on [managing Bing Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/manage-bing-maps-organization).

Later in this article, we'll test geocoding and location services to make sure they're working properly.

### Enable resource scheduling for entities

Next up, navigate to **Resource Scheduling > Administration > Enable Resource Scheduling for Entities**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Enabling entities for scheduling](media/Perform-Initial-Configurations-image8.png)  

This is where administrators decide which entities can be scheduled to Resources. When Field Service is installed, work orders are enabled for resource scheduling, and when Project Service is installed, projects are enabled. This is made possible by a solution called [Universal Resource Scheduling](universal-resource-scheduling.md) that adds scheduling capabilities to entities and makes use of the schedule board. Any entity (including custom entities) can be enabled for scheduling; typical examples include cases, opportunities, and orders.

Next, verify that work orders are enabled for resource scheduling.

## Step 2: Field Service settings

Go to **Field Service** > **Settings** > **Field Service Settings**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Field Service Administration from Dynamics 365 dropdown menu](media/quickstart-fs-settings.png)  

In the **Other** section, decide if you would like the application to auto geocode addresses. The recommended setting is **Yes.**
 
"Auto geocode addresses" means that after entering an address on entities such as accounts, contacts, users, and work orders, the system will automatically attempt to locate the address and populate latitude and longitude values. Disallowing auto geocoding for addresses  requires the user to select a Geocode button.

Next, navigate to the **Work Order / Booking** section and enter a work order prefix and work order starting number.

An example, as seen below, is **WO** and **100**. This is recommended, but not required.

## Step 3: Test geocoding

Finally, letâ€™s test geocoding.

Go to **Field Service > Work Orders** and select **+New**.

Begin typing an address.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Work Order address form](media/Perform-Initial-Configurations-image13.png)  

The system will find the address and present it as a suggestion.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of address](media/Perform-Initial-Configurations-image14.png)  

After selecting the correct address, the form will populate the rest of the address, **including the latitude and longitude**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of address with latitude and longitude populated on work order form](media/Perform-Initial-Configurations-image15.png)  

If you don't want the system to auto geocode addresses, select the geocode button in the top ribbon.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Geocode button](media/Perform-Initial-Configurations-image16.png)  

>[!Note]
> **Pro Tip \#1:** When using the Field Service application, it's uncommon to enter addresses on a work order. The standard process is to geocode accounts, and when a service account is entered on a work order as the service location, the geocoded address is pulled from the account and added to the work order.

>[!Note]
> **Pro Tip \#2:** It's possible to geocode multiple records at one time by selecting the records from a view. In the screenshot below, we are mass geocoding accounts.

# Dynamics 365 Field Service (Preview) overview

With Dynamics 365 Field Service (Preview), frontline workers and managers can create, view, and manage work orders within Microsoft Outlook and Teams. A frontline manager (FLM) is typically a service manager and dispatcher. A frontline worker (FLW) is a technician.

An Outlook add-in allows frontline managers to view and create work orders in Outlook, so they can quickly respond to service requests and questions. A Viva Connections dashboard in Teams allows frontline workers to get an at-a-glance view of their workday and frontline managers to view and create work orders. Users can also initiate a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call within Teams mobile.

As an organization, you can use the capabilities of the Field Service (Preview) using Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Teams or both. For more information about what Field Service (Preview) provides, see:

- [Field Service (Preview) Teams overview for the Frontline Manager](front-line-teams-manager.md)
- [Field Service (Preview) Teams overview for the Frontline Worker](front-line-teams-worker.md)

Dynamics 365 Field Service (Preview) allows administrators and users to access content and share data outside of Microsoft 365 once consent is given to link their Microsoft work or school account with their Dynamics 365 account. See [Field Service (Preview) for Administrators](front-line-admin.md).

# Activate Field Service mobile configurator
   
The mobile configurator allows your organization to use, administer, and customize the Field Service Mobile app for your field workers.

## Fill out an activation form

A 30-day trial automatically starts when you install the mobile configuration tool for your Dynamics 365 instance. You need to submit a request to activate the trial before the trial period ends. You must activate the configurator to continue using and customizing the Field Service Mobile app.

Complete the [activation request form for the mobile configurator](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_qdDvPY821Ojv3lrQCnA7JUNEVaR01JNFNIMDNOME8xNlBWMEVFSUhEQS4u) for **1 license**. Note that you need the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement organization ID to complete the request form.


## Additional notes

- To find out your **trial end date**, go to **Settings** > **Woodford** > **MobileCRM Woodford**. You'll see the trial end date at the top of the screen.

- If you make any updates or do any work that changes the organization ID, you need to submit a new request to activate the mobile configurator for the organization.

**To find your organization ID**:

 1. Go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Developer Resources**.
 2. In the **Instance Reference Information** section, locate the ID.

## Previous app versions

For Field Service Mobile (2016) and Field Service Mobile (2017), you need to [fill out a form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_qdDvPY821Ojv3lrQCnA7JUNEVaR01JNFNIMDNOME8xNlBWMEVFSUhEQS4u) to request access for your users.

Each Dynamics 365 for Field Service license you purchase from Microsoft allows you to activate mobile access for one user, with the total number of mobile users allocated across all your production, sandbox, and trial organizations not to exceed the total number of licenses you purchased. For example, if you purchase 100 field service licenses and you manage one production organization and one sandbox, you could activate mobile access for 50 users at both organizations for a maximum total of 100 mobile users (not 100 mobile users at each organization for a total of 200).

## Unified Interface Native Mobile

Unfortunately, using the Unified Interface's native mobile offering in offline mode for Field Service scenarios is not supported. There are a number of errors you will encounter because the platform's native mobile experience is not yet robust enough to support the offline capabilities needed to enable Field Service. Please use [Field Service Mobile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/field-service-mobile-overview).

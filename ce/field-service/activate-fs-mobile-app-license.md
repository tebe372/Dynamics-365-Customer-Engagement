# Extend Field Service mobile configuration tool trial
   
[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The mobile configuration tool allows your organization to use, administer, and customize the Field Service Mobile app for your field workers.

## Fill out a trial extension request form

A 30-day trial automatically starts when you install the mobile configuration tool for your Dynamics 365 instance. You need to submit a request to extend the trial before the trial period ends. You must extend a trial to continue using and customizing the Field Service Mobile app.

Complete the [form to request an extension to the trial for the mobile configuration tool](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_qdDvPY821Ojv3lrQCnA7JUNEVaR01JNFNIMDNOME8xNlBWMEVFSUhEQS4u) for **1 license**. Note that you need the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement organization ID to complete the request form.


## Additional notes

To find out your **trial end date**, go to **Settings** > **Woodford** > **MobileCRM Woodford**. You'll see the trial end date at the top of the screen.

- If you make any updates or do any work that changes the organization ID, you need to submit a new request to activate the mobile licenses for the organization.

- Field service mobile licenses are allocated to one organization at a time, based on the organization ID.

**To find your organization ID**:

 1. Go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Developer Resources**.
 2. In the **Instance Reference Information** section, locate the ID.

## Previous app versions

For Field Service Mobile (2016) and Field Service Mobile (2017), you need to [fill out a form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_qdDvPY821Ojv3lrQCnA7JUNEVaR01JNFNIMDNOME8xNlBWMEVFSUhEQS4u) to request access for your users.

Each Dynamics 365 for Field Service license you purchase from Microsoft allows you to assign one mobile license per user, with the total number of mobile users allocated across all your production, sandbox, and trial organizations not to exceed the total number of licenses you purchased. For example, if you purchase 100 field service licenses and you manage one production organization and one sandbox, you could assign mobile licenses to 50 users at both organizations for a maximum total of 100 mobile users (not 100 mobile users at each organization for a total of 200).

# Optimization schedules 
After creating a scope and a goal, you can combine and schedule them in an optimization schedule.

You can define when resource scheduling optimization (RSO) should optimize requirements and bookings for selected resources - for example, at 1:00 AM on weekdays. Creating a schedule also includes creating a scope and a goal.

Give the schedule a logical name to express which resource requirements and bookable resources will be optimized. If a scope and goal have not been created, you will need to create them for this schedule.

- **Timer**: Defines how often this schedule will run.
- **Timer Mode**: The reference instant when the schedule starts the
    timer (**Fixed** or **After Job Completion**). For example, if a timer is set to 30
    minutes, the first run starts 30 minutes from the publish date/time.
    **Fixed** mode means the optimization runs every 30 minutes. **After Job Completion** mode means the optimization runs 30 minutes from the
    end of the last RSO job execution. **Job** refers to the RSO job.
- **Valid From** and **Valid To**: The first and last date and time when this
    schedule is valid for execution.

Filter is used to set a variety of combinations. For example, the schedule will run at 1:00 AM and 7:00 PM every Monday through Friday.

The Filter section of the schedule is an advanced feature. The Filter window allows for a variety of combinations to be selected:

- You can filter by month, numerical day, weekday, hour, and minute, and refer
    to a configured time zone.
- Leaving all filters blank means no filters will be applied.

### How timers work with filters

If you configure your timer and filter as shown here, RSO will run every 30 minutes after the previous job is completed, from 12/3/2016 at 9:00 AM to 12/4/2018 at 9:00 AM, except on Saturdays and Sundays.

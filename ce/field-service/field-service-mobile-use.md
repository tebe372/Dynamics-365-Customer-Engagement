# Use Field Service Mobile (Xamarin)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Field Service Mobile (Xamarin app) has reached end of life on **June 30, 2022**. Mobile configurator licenses will no longer be granted to new tenants onboarding with Dynamics 365 Field Service as of **June 30, 2021**. New tenants coming online should start with the new [Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile](mobile-2020-power-platform.md) app. For more information, visit [the documentation](mobile-power-app-get-started.md).

In this article, let's look at common tasks that technicians perform on Field Service Mobile while completing work orders.

## Sign in and sync data

 To sign in, you need your organization's Dynamics 365 URL, your user name, and password. Contact your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrator if you don't have this information. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Find your Dynamics 365 administrator or support person](../customerengagement/on-premises/basics/find-administrator-support.md).  
  
1. Open the app, and enter your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] credentials. When sign-in completes, you'll see the home screen.
  
2. To sync your device to the server, tap the **Sync** button to download changes made on the server to your phone or tablet, and upload information from your device to the server.  
  
   ![Screenshot of the sync the Field Service Mobile app device.](../field-service/media/field-service-sync-mobile-device.PNG "Sync the Field Service Mobile app device")  
  
## Work online or offline  
 
[!INCLUDE[pn_fieldservice_mobile_app_short](../includes/pn-fieldservice-mobile-app-short.md)] lets you work online or offline. Online mode requires an Internet connection; offline mode does not.  
  
The system administrator configures the app to sync when it launches, when information changes, or every few minutes.
  
### Online mode

 When you’re working online, information continuously syncs with the server, so you don’t need to manually sync your device.  
  
- To work online, select the **Online/Offline Mode** icon.  The screenshot shows what the option looks when you’re online.  
  
  ![Online mode in the Field Service Mobile app.](../field-service/media/field-service-online-mode.PNG "Online mode in the Field Service Mobile app")  
  
### Offline mode

 When you're working offline, the information you need is downloaded to your device so that you can continue your work without an internet connection. When you enter information, it’s saved to your device and sent to the server on the next sync.  
  
- To work offline, select the **Online/Offline Mode** icon.  The screenshot shows how the button looks when you’re offline.  
  
  ![Offline mode in the Field Service Mobile app.](../field-service/media/field-service-offline-mode.PNG "Offline mode in the Field Service Mobile app")  
  
## Get around the app (for all security roles)

When you first sign in to Field Service Mobile (Xamarin), you’ll see your home screen, which shows you a list of actionable items. To get more information, select any of the items.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you have a [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)] admin, dispatcher,  inventory purchase, or resource (field agent) security role, you can use [!INCLUDE[pn_fieldservice_mobile_app_short](../includes/pn-fieldservice-mobile-app-short.md)] (mobile). However, depending on your security role, you may not have permission to access or change certain data in the app. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Find your Dynamics 365 administrator or support person](../customerengagement/on-premises/basics/find-administrator-support.md)

## Review work order bookings

When a work order is assigned to you, it shows up in [!INCLUDE[pn_fieldservice_mobile_app_short](../includes/pn-fieldservice-mobile-app-short.md)] (mobile).

By default, you can only see work orders for the current day plus the next seven days; those work orders must have a status of scheduled, traveling, or in progress. Once a work order is completed, you can no longer see it in [!INCLUDE[pn_fieldservice_mobile_app_short](../includes/pn-fieldservice-mobile-app-short.md)] (mobile).

1. To see your work order bookings, select **Bookable Resource Booking**.

2. By default, work orders are listed in the **Agenda** view. To change views, select **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**.

   ![Bookable Resource Bookings in the agenda view.](../field-service/media/field-service-booking-view.PNG "Bookable Resource Bookings in the agenda view")

You can also select the **Arrow** to see your bookings for the next day. Or, you can use the filter to see work orders with a specific booking status.

   ![Booking info view.](../field-service/media/field-service-book-view-info.PNG "Booking info view")

## Open a work order

1. To open a work order, from the list of bookings, select the work order that you want to open. The work order opens on the right.

2. To open the work order in full screen view, at the top, double-tap **Work Order**.

   ![View work order.](../field-service/media/field-service-view-work-order.PNG "View work order")

## See the location of a work order on a map

1. Open the work order, and then select **Map**. This shows the location of the work order on a map.

2. To get driving directions, select **Driving Direction**. This opens the default driving directions app on your mobile device. It provides turn-by-turn directions from your location to the work order location.

   ![Work order map view.](../field-service/media/field-service-work-order-map-view.PNG "Work order map view")

## Update work order status

 The minute you start driving to the next job, it’s important to update the status of the work order. This keeps the dispatcher up to date on what’s going on with the work order, and lets the dispatch team provide the customer with the current status.

1. Open the work order, and then select **Booking**.

2. Select **Add** for **Booking Status**.

3. Select a status. If you’re driving to the work order location, update your status to **Traveling**.

   ![Update booking status.](../field-service/media/field-service-update-booking-status.PNG "Update booking status")

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Make sure to update the status again when you arrive on site, and again when you complete the work order.

4. When you’re done, select **Save**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  When the work order is complete, remember to mark it as **Completed**.

## Update work order start time

When a dispatcher schedules a work order, the booking will have a start and end time. This may be the time promised to the customer, but if you’re running late or the job is taking longer than expected, it’s important to update the start and end time. This automatically keeps the dispatcher up to date on the schedule board.

- Open the work order, select **Booking**, and then change the **Start Time**.

  ![Update work order start time.](../field-service/media/field-service-update-start-time.PNG "Update work order start time")

## Check work order details

To get more information on what work needs to be done for the service call, look at the **Info**, **Other**, and **Incidents** tabs.

The **Info** tab provides service account info, address, priority, and more.

The **Other** tab provides billing account info, service time windows, price lists, and more.

 ![Work order Other tab.](../field-service/media/field-service-other-tab.PNG "Work order Other tab")

The **Incidents** tab shows which incidents are linked to the work order.

 ![Work order Incidents tab.](../field-service/media/field-service-incidents-tab.PNG "Work order Incidents tab")

## Check service tasks, products, and services

When a work order is created, incidents are added to the work order, which includes a list of service tasks, products, and services.

Service tasks let a field agent know what tasks need to be performed for the work order. Products tell them what products they might have to use to complete the work order. Services show the hours needed to complete the work.

# Set up booking statuses in Dynamics 365 Field Service

Booking statuses allow you to create multiple substatuses mapped to each of your booking statuses in order to more precisely define your company's unique business processes.  
  
1. From the main menu, go to **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Active Booking Statuses**.  
  
2. Select **+New** on the **Active Booking Statuses** screen.  
  
3. Use the tooltips to help fill in your information.  
  
   -   Choose a custom **Status Color** value in order to specify which color the resource schedule time slot will be displayed on the schedule board.  
  
   -   Map the substatus to a parent status by selecting a value in the **Field Service Status** field.  
  
   **Note**: You can also set a default status for scheduled and canceled bookings in the **General** section in the **Field Service Setting**. For more information: [Configure default settings](../field-service/configure-default-settings.md)

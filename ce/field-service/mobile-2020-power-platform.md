## Implementation and migration guidance
- Recommend customers to continue to use Xamarin “OEM” based mobile app
- if i were deploying today what should i do? - use current FSM app
- How should i pick which client to use? - use feature parity chart above, if FSM2020 meets your needs, use that bc eventually FSM 2020 will be the default
- when will field service mobile not be available for new customers? support for FSM will end 2022
- new customers going live after October 2021 will have to use FSM2020

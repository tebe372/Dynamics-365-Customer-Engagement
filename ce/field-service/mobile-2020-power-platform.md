# Field Service Mobile (2020)


Field Service Mobile (2020) is a mobile app designed and optimized for technicians to view Dynamics 365 Field Service work orders, customer assets, accounts and contacts. Different than Field Service Mobile (see feature comparison below), this alternative mobile app is built on Microsoft's Power Platform as a model-driven app and is customizbale to your business needs with the same admin console as all Dynamics 365 business apps.


Available natively for Apple iOS and Google Android phones and tablets, Field Service Mobile (2020) offers technicians many capabilities they need to perform on site customer service like a calendar view of assigned jobs, support for picture, video, and asset barcode scanning, customer signature capture, and offline capabilities so technicians can continue viewing and recording work in areas without internet.


## Implementation and migration guidance

It is recommended to continue using the existing "[Field Service Mobile](./field-service-mobile-app-user-guide.md)" mobile app for current and new deployments of Dynamics 365 Field Service. As development in Field Service Mobile (2020) continues through 2021, capabiltiies will become comparable to Field Service Mobile and system administrators should use the feature comparison information below to decide which mobile app is right for their technicians.

Eventually, Field Service Mobile (2020) will be the recommended mobile app for Dynamics 365 Field Service and support for Field Service Mobile will end December 2022.

# Implement the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app for your technicians

Field service technicians often need to see and update their work orders while onsite at a job.

To meet this need, Field Service offers the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app.

The Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app is built on Microsoft Power Platform. In our documentation, we refer to this app as the **Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app**. This mobile app is included with your Field Service license.

## Implementation of Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app

The Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app will evolve over time and benefit from the new features and continuous investments in Dynamics 365 Field Service and Power Platform. To learn about capabilities for the app, refer to the feature table later in this article. For more information about integration and onboarding, see [planning your deployment](#planning-for-your-deployment) and related links at the bottom of this article.

> [!NOTE]
> The legacy Field Service Mobile (Xamarin) app reaches end of life on June 30th, 2022. To avoid disruption to service, all deployments must migrate to the Field Serice (Dynamics 365) mobile app before that date. For more information, see: [Field Service Mobile Xamarin end of support FAQ](/dynamics365/field-service/activate-fs-mobile-app-license#faqs).

## Planning for your deployment

Here are a few more planning tips to help with your project:

**Do user acceptance training**. Ensure buy-in across your organization by bringing the people who will be using the app into the release process early. Select a diverse set of users across geographies or business units. Set up feedback channels to understand pain points and address problems before going live.

**Do a phased roll out**. Reduce risk by segmenting your release over phases; commonly this is done by geography, or by business group. Take feedback from users and expand the deployment once stable.

**Pilot the mobile apps side by side**. If you're a current customer of Field Service, you can pilot the new Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app alongside the Field Service Mobile (Xamarin) app, as well as other Field Service apps your organization might be using. This will help you assess how your frontline workers are currently using the apps, like what data is most important and what information is most commonly viewed and edited. You'll better understand what functionality to include in the new Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app.

**Measure performance**. How the mobile app performs is a big factor in how much frontline workers enjoy using the app. Add performance measures to the deployment plan and test how editing forms, the mobile offline profile, and workflows affect app performance. Take feedback from users to determine what is necessary and what can be removed or hidden from forms.

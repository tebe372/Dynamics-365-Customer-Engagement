# Turn on auto geocoding to calculate estimated travel time

Dynamics 365 Field Service needs latitude and longitude values for service account records to estimate travel times when scheduling a work order to a resource.
  
With the **Auto Geo Code Addresses** setting, the system attempts to automatically add the coordinates based on the address provided for the service account.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use the schedule board booking functionality, geocoding, and location services, you need to turn on maps.  
>
> For more information, see [Connect to maps](field-service-maps-address-locations.md#connect-to-maps).  

## Enable on automatic geocoding  
  
1. Open the **Field Service** app.

1. Change to the **Settings** area and go to **Administration**, and then choose **Field Service Settings**.

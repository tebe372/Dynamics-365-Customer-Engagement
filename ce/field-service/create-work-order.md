# Create a work order to coordinate and schedule resources and activities

A work order in Dynamics 365 Field Service has information on what work needs to be done. Work orders are used to coordinate and schedule resources and activities. They can be used for different types of work, such as installations, repairs, or preventive maintenance.  
  
A work order is often created from a case, an agreement, or an opportunity. It gets scheduled either manually, with the schedule assistant, or the Resource Scheduling Optimization add-in. Once the work is complete, it's reviewed and approved by a manager.

## Create a work order

You can create a work order quickly from the Get Started page and from the Work Order list.

### From the Get Started page

1. As a Field Service administrator or system administrator in the **Field Service** app, go to the **Get Started** page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/get-started.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the getting started page in Field Service.":::  

1. Select **Create** in the **Create your work orders** section.

1. Fill in the basic information about the work order.

   :::image type="content" source="media/get-started-wo.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new work order form triggered from the get started page in Field Service.":::

1. In the form, add as many tasks, products, and services as needed.

1. If you want to immediately schedule the work order, select **Save & Book**. Select **Save & Close** to only save the work order.

The Get Started work order create form doesnâ€™t support switching forms. If added as a form to other parts of the app, switching to this form will leave you unable to switch back.

### From the work order form and record list

1. In Field Service, change to the **Service** area.

1. In the **Scheduling** section, select **Work Orders**.

1. Select **New**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-new-work-order-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the active work orders list in Field Service.":::

1. At a minimum, enter information in the following required fields.

    - For **Service Account**, select an account from the list or [create a new service account](accounts.md).
    - For **Work Order Type**, select a work order type from the list or [create a new work order type](create-work-order-types.md).
    - For **System Status**, select **Open-Unscheduled**.
    - For **Price List**, select a price list from list or [create a new price list](create-price-list.md).
    - Choose if the work order is **Taxable** or not. If the work order isn't taxable work order products and services aren't considered taxable either, regardless of the taxable setting on the product or service.
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-work-order-new2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a work order in Field Service.":::
  
1. Provide optional information for the work order as applicable. Service tasks, products, or services are added later.
  
1. Select **Save** or **Save and close**.

## Add service tasks, products, or services to the work order  

When the work order has been created and saved, you can add any related tasks, products, or services to the work order.  
  
- Go to the **Service Tasks** section and select **New Work Order Service Task**. [!INCLUDE[proc_handy_infotips](../includes/proc-handy-infotips.md)] For more information, go to [Set up service task types](set-up-service-task-types.md).
  
- Go to the **Products** or **Services** section and select **New Work Order Product/Service**. [!INCLUDE[proc_handy_infotips](../includes/proc-handy-infotips.md)] For more information, go to [Create a product or service](create-product-or-service.md).
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > When you add a product, remember that if you want to reserve a product for the work order, set **Allocated** to **Yes**.  

Consider using incident types to add more details and instructions to your work orders. Products, service tasks, and characteristics are added automatically when you create a work order from an incident. Otherwise, you can add them manually when you create a work order. For more information, go to [Configure incident types](configure-incident-types.md).

## Work order user default settings

### Open work order subgrids as popups

Configure work order subentities to pop out as dialog boxes and edit them without having to leave the work order form. This configuration helps dispatchers keep the work order context. Administrators can enable the **Work Order Subgrid Records Open as Popups** setting in the settings area. For more information, go to [Other settings](configure-default-settings.md#other-settings).

### Show simplified work order commands

Since Field Service version 8.8.47, the work order ribbon is simplified by default. It shows only the most relevant commands. An administrator can disable the **Show Simplified Work Order Commands** setting to show all commands. For more information, go to [Work Order / Booking settings](configure-default-settings.md#work-order--booking-settings).

Check out the following video on simplified work order commands and more updates to work orders.

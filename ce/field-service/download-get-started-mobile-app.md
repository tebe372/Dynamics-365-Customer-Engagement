# Download the mobile app and get started

Available natively for Apple iOS and Google Android phones and tablets, as well as Windows laptops and tablets, the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app offers technicians the capabilities they need for onsite customer service.

## Prerequisites

Before technicians can use the mobile app, a system administrator must [set up the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](mobile-power-app-get-started.md) along with users and security roles.

## Download

Go to the app store on your iOS, Android, or Windows device and search for **Dynamics 365 Field Service**.

Download the app called **Field Service (Dynamics 365)**, as seen in the following screenshot.

## Sign in

Launch the app and sign in with your username and password for Field Service.  

If you can't sign in, contact your organization's administrator. They may need to [set up users and security roles](../field-service/view-user-accounts-security-roles.md).

After you sign in, the app may download offline data to your device. It can take some time to complete. The downloaded data depends on your administrator's settings for the offline profile of the mobile app.

## View scheduled work orders

## [Unified Interface app](#tab/vCurrent)

The first screen shows a calendar view of your scheduled work orders.

In the footer, select **More** > **Show as** > **Read-only Grid** to see the bookings as a list instead.

## [Public Preview app](#tab/vNext)

The first screen shows the list of all scheduled work orders for today for the logged in technician. The list can be filtered by work order status and sorted by various dimensions.

Each work order in the list exposes some quick actions in the contextual menu or by swiping from left to right.

## Troubleshoot the app

## [Unified Interface app](#tab/vCurrent)

If you run into issues with the app, you can often solve them by removing all cached data.

On the sitemap, select your profile icon in the top left and choose **Reconfigure**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Device render showing the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app, showing the reconfigure option.](./media/mobile-2020-offline-reconfigure.png)

Reconfiguring deletes data and metadata for the current organization from the cache.

## [Public Preview app](#tab/vNext)

This feature is not currently available in the Public Preview app, since offline mode is not yet supported.

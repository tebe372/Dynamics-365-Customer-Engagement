# Download the mobile app and get started

Available natively for Apple iOS and Google Android phones and tablets, as well as Windows laptops and tablets, the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app offers technicians many capabilities they need to perform onsite customer service, such as:  

- A calendar view of assigned jobs.
- Support for picture, video, and asset barcode scanning.
- Customer signature capture.
- Offline capabilities so technicians can continue viewing and recording work in areas without internet.

For a guided walkthrough, check out the following video.

## Prerequisites

Before using the mobile app, a system administrator must [install and set up the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](mobile-power-app-get-started.md) along with users and security roles.

## Download

Go to the app store on your iOS, Android, or Windows device and search for **Dynamics 365 Field Service**.

Download the app called **Field Service (Dynamics 365)**, as seen in the following screenshot.

## Sign in

Launch the app and sign in with your username and password.  

Administrators should go to the articles on [setting up users and security roles](../field-service/view-user-accounts-security-roles.md) and [creating a Bookable Resource](set-up-bookable-resources.md) for help.

Upon sign-in, the app will download important Field Service information as defined by administrators.

## Home

To get to the sitemap, select the menu icon from the calendar view. From here, you can find other important information like accounts, contacts, customer assets, or to submit time entries.

## View scheduled work orders

The first screen you'll see is a calendar view of your scheduled work orders.

Select **More** > **Show as** > **Read-only Grid** to see the bookings as a list as shown on the right side of the screenshot.

## Home + settings

### Sign out and reconfigure

Reconfiguring the app is a good way to troubleshoot issues and remove all cached data.

Go to the main menu, then select the person icon in the top left.

Then select **Reconfigure**.

Reconfiguring deletes data and metadata for the current organization from the cache.

### Recent + pins

Use the **Recent** option in the main menu to quickly find things you recently viewed, like work orders, assets, time entries, and more. You can also "pin" important records for easy access.

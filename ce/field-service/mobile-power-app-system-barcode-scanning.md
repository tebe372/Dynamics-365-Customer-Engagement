# Barcode scanning and global search

Technicians can use the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app to scan barcodes.

By scanning barcodes, technicians can:

1. Enter a field with the barcode value to facilitate data entry
2. Search the database for records that match the barcode for easy lookup.

## Step 1: Enable global search

By default, Dynamics 365 Field Service is configured to search against account, contact, user, and activity. You can customize global search to include additional entities, such as customer asset and product, which helps technicians search, find by keyword, and scan to search by barcode, UPC, or QR code.

For more information, see: [How to Setup Global Search](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/xrm/posts/how-to-set-up-global-search-in-microsoft-dynamics-365)

## Step 2: Confirm the barcode field

After enabling global search, make sure there is a barcode field on the entity you wish to search via barcode scan. A common example is adding a barcode field to the customer asset form.

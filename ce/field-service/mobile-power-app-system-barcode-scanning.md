# Barcode scanning and global search

Technicians can use the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app to scan barcodes.

By scanning barcodes, technicians can:

1. Enter a field with the barcode value to facilitate data entry
2. Search the database for records that match the barcode for easy lookup.

## Step 1: Add a barcode field to the form

First, make sure there is a barcode field on the record type you want to add the barcode information. A common example is adding a barcode field to the customer asset form, which we'll walk through in this article.

).

1. Find **Field Service Mobile** in your list of Dynamics 365 apps and select **Open in App Designer**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

2. Go to **Edit form** and select the form you want to use barcode scanning for.

3. Add or select the field that you want to add barcode scanning to.

4. Save and publish all changes in the form and then switch to classic view.

5. Select the required field and double-click on it.

1. Go to the **Controls** tab and select **Add control**.

7. Select **Barcode Scanner** and add it.

8. Enable the control for phones and tablets, then **Save and Publish** the changes.

## Step 2: Test scanning a barcode to populate the field value

Back in the app, you'll see the barcode-enabled field as a barcode icon beside the field. Selecting the barcode icon will open the camera and read any barcode or QR code. After your device's camera successfully reads the QR code, the barcode value populates into the field. Then save the form.

Within the mobile app you may need to go to **Profile** > **Reconfigure** to enable new published changes.

## Step 3: Enable search 

By default, Dynamics 365 Field Service is configured to search against account, contact, user, and activity. You can customize search to include additional record types, such as customer assets and products. Expanding search parameters can help technicians search, find by keyword, and scan to search by barcode, UPC, or QR code.

1. Enable the record type your barcode is part of for relevance search. In our example, we use the customer asset record type). For more information, see [how to set up relevance search](/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization). 

2. Add the barcode-enabled field to the record type's quick find view, as seen in the following screenshot.

3. Save and publish changes.

## Step 4: Test search by barcode

1. Enter the barcode value into the barcode field.

2. Select the search icon at the top of the mobile app. 

3. Select **Categorized Search**, then select the barcode scanning icon.

4. Scan the barcode, and the system will search for records with a matching barcode.

> If you are using offline first the record will need to be included in your offline profile and downlaoded to the device to display in search results.

# Barcode scanning and global search

Technicians can use the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app to scan barcodes.

By scanning barcodes, technicians can:

1. Enter a field with the barcode value to facilitate data entry
2. Search the database for records that match the barcode for easy lookup.

## Step 1: Add a barcode field to the form

First make sure there is a barcode field on the entity you wish to add the barcode information to or retrieve via search later on. A common example is adding a barcode field to the customer asset form which we will show in this article.

## Step 2: Test scanning a barcode to populate the field value

9. Back in the app, the form has field with the barcode scanner option. Selecting the barcode icon will open the camera and read any barcode or QR code. After your device's camera successfully reads the QR code you

## Step 3: Enable categorized search 

By default, Dynamics 365 Field Service is configured to search against account, contact, user, and activity. You can customize global search to include additional entities, such as customer asset and product, which helps technicians search, find by keyword, and scan to search by barcode, UPC, or QR code.

For more information, see: [How to Setup Global Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization)


You will need to:
1. Enable the entity your barcode is part of for categorized search (in our example the 'Customer Asset' entity).
2. Add the field that you previosuly enabled for barcode scanning to the entiities

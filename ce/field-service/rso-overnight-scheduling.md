# Automated Overnight Scheduling

How and when Resource Scheduling Optimization (RSO) runs is flexible based on your organization's scheduling needs. RSO can be run manually, based on a schedule, or triggered from a workflow action (CreateScheduledOptimizationRequest); and every run can optimize a specific set of resources, requirements, and bookings that are defined with system views.

Common scenarios include:

- Manual Run  
- Overnight scheduling
- Single resource optimization
- Intraday scheduling
- Condition based workflow
- Simulation 

In this article let's explore overnight scheduling and understand why an organization may choose to optimize work orders this way and how to configure it.

Configure Resource Scheduling Optimization (RSO) to run each night to schedule and optimize the next day's jobs leaving the dispatcher to make changes and deal with cancellations and exceptions the next day when he or she arrives in the morning.

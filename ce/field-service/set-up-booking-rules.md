# Set up booking rules (Field Service)
Booking rules in [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_field_service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] allow a System Administrator to create warning or error messages that users see when creating or editing a resource booking record, based on custom conditions. For example, a booking rule could be created to warn a user when they attempt to book a work order to a resource on the schedule board that doesn't have the skills required for the job.  
  
 Set up booking rules to validate a booking when it is created or modified.  
  
1.  From the main menu, click **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Booking Rules**.  
  
2.  On the **Active Booking Rules** screen, click **+New** in the upper left corner.  
  
3.  Type a **Name** for the new booking rule.  
  
4.  Select a **Web Resource** that has been previously created by the System Administrator to contain the validation logic and warning text.  
  
5.  Enter the **Method Name**.  
  
6.  Click **Save**.

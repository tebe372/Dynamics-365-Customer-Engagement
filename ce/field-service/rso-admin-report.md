# Resource scheduling optimization admin reports

The resource scheduling optimization admin report analyzes when and how resource scheduling optimization runs, but not the actual booking results.

Go to the **Resource Scheduling Optimization** app and find **Reports** under the **Analytics** section. 

To run the report, the resource scheduling optimization administrator needs to select one optimization schedule - for example, WA Schedule 1 - and select one or more optimization requests.â€¯

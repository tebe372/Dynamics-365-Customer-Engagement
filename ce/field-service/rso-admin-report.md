# Resource scheduling optimization admin report

The admin report in the Resource Scheduling Optimization add-in analyzes when and how resource scheduling optimization runs, but not the actual booking results.

## Before you start

To run the report, the resource scheduling optimization administrator needs to publish at least one [optimization schedule](rso-optimization-schedule.md).â€¯ 

## Filters and slicers

- **Schedule name**: Name of the [optimization schedule](rso-optimization-schedule.md).
- **Optimization request**: [List of jobs](rso-schedule-optimization.md#monitoring-optimization-requests) that ran to optimize schedules.

## Report metrics

To access the admin report, open the **Resource Scheduling Optimization** app and go to **Analytics** > **Reports**.

### Optimization Scope

Number of bookings, requirements, and book in the selected schedule requests.

### Optimization E2E time (mins)

Time in minutes to run the optimization job from start to finish.

### Number of failed optimization requests

Number of failed optimization requests in the selected schedule requests.

## Next steps

- [Learn about other reports](reports.md)
- [Create an optimization schedule](rso-optimization-schedule.md)

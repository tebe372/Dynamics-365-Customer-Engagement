## Work order and bookings settings 
  
|   Options     |   Description  |
| ------------- | -------------- |
|   General  |   Select default booking and work order options. |
|  Work order prefix  |  Select a default prefix for all your work orders. The prefix will  be added to the beginning of the work order number. This helps you easily identify  work orders  from other types of service requests in the system. |
|  Default work order completed status  |   Select whether the default  status for a completed work order is **Completed** or **Posted**. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up booking statuses](../field-service/set-up-booking-statuses.md)   |
|  Word order starting number |  Select a starting number for your work order. For example, if you choose "100" then your first work order number will be 100, and second one will be 101, and so on.   |
|  Work order invoice creation  |   Select whether the system should automatically generate a billing invoice for work orders when the status is set to **Closed-Posted**. |
|  Travel charge item      | Select what product is used in the system for travel charges for a work order. For example, when you have a booking with a journal type set to traveling, the system automatically creates a work order service with the duration of the journal for travel time. The pricing will be determined by the standard pricing rules. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create a product or service](../field-service/create-product-or-service.md) |
|  Default warehouse   |    Select the default warehouse that work order products will be taken from unless specified otherwise. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create a warehouse](../field-service/create-warehouse.md)   |                                                                                               
| Disable customer asset validation | This field will control whether a work order can be raised where the customer assets on the work order do not belong to the work order's service account. When set to *Yes*, the logic restricts creating a work order where the customer assets are not related to the service account is disabled. When set to *No*, the system enforces that the customer assets on a work order must be related to the service account.|
| Suggest reparenting customer assets | When a customer adds an asset to a work order that does not relate to the work order's service account, if this setting is set to *Yes* a dialogue will appear asking if this should be reparented to the work order's service account. When set to *No*, this dialogue does not appear and customer assets are not automatically reparented to the work order's service account. |
| Calculate tax | Tax codes calculate and add taxes to used products and services. Set to *No* to remove the tax code field and calculations from all related forms. New environments created with Field Service v8.8.39.37+ will have this setting set to *No* by default. |
| Calculate price | The work order has a number of pricing-related fields and functions. By default, this field is set to *Yes*, which will ensure all pricing-related fields and logic are enabled. When this setting it set to *No* the work order's, work order product's, and work order service's pricing-related fields are removed and pricing logic is disabled. Further, work order's will not generate invoices when the work order is set to "Posted".|
| Generate actuals | When set to **Yes** many actuals records are created related to a work order over the course of a work order's lifecycle. If set to *No*, work order-related actuals will not be automatically created. |
| Show simplified work order commands | This setting influences the command bar on the work order's grid and form. By default, this field will be set to *Yes*, which means that a focused set of work order commands will be shown on the work order form and work order list view. When set to _Yes_, the following commands will be hidden from the form: deactivate, check access, process, add to queue, queue item details, assign, share, email a link, flow, Word templates. The following commands will be hidden from the list view when no records are selected: email a link, flow, import from Excel. The following commands will be hidden from the list view when a record is selected: activate, deactivate, email a link, add to queue, flow, Word templates, Excel templates (also hidden when a record is selected). When set to *No* all commands will be visible on the work order form and work order list view. |
| Resource  pay type  |  Choose from pay types that you have created in the system to calculate timestamp-based labor cost on booking journals when a booking is marked as complete. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up resource pay types](../field-service/set-up-resource-pay-types.md)  |
| Work pay type   |  Select the pay type that will be used with work performed during the resource’s normal work hours.   |
| Business closure pay type  |  Select the pay type that will be applied on days that have been marked with **Business Closures**. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set when your business is closed](../customer-service/set-when-business-closed-cs-app.md) |
|  Travel pay type |    Select the pay type that will be applied to time that the resource is traveling to a service location to perform service work.  |
|  Overtime pay type |   Select the pay type that will be applied to time that is outside of the resource’s scheduled work hours.  |
|  Break pay type  |  Select the pay type that will be applied to time that the resource is on break while performing service work.  |
|  Crew Management    |                                                                                    |
|  Default Crew Strategy  |   Select the strategy that will be applied, by default, to any crews created in the system. Upon install, this field is set to "Crew Leader Management." While this setting does apply a default value, this value can be managed independently for each crew.  |
|  Schedule assistant  |  Choose default options for the schedule assistant.   |

|  Options   |    Description    |
|------------|-------------------|
| Auto generate work order for agreement booking  |  Select whether the system should automatically generate work order bookings based on agreements. If set to **No**, then you will need to manually create the work order records by clicking the ribbon button on the **Schedule Date** record. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up customer agreements](../field-service/set-up-customer-agreements.md)     |
| Generate booking dates X months in advance    | [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)] agreements generate booking dates based on the agreement booking setup recurrence schedule. These are the dates that the system will generate a work order record, if the auto generate work order is set to **Yes**. This setting determines how many months in advance the system will generate booking date records. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up customer agreements](../field-service/set-up-customer-agreements.md) |
|   Generate invoices dates X months in advance   |   [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)] agreements generate invoice dates based on the agreement invoice setup recurrence schedule. These are the dates that the system will generate an invoice record, if the auto generate invoice is set to **Yes**. This setting determines how many months in advance the system will generate invoice date records. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up customer agreements](../field-service/set-up-customer-agreements.md)    |
|  Agreement starting number   |  Select a starting number for agreements. For example, if you choose 3000, then your first agreement will be 3000, and the second one will be 3001, and so on.  |
| Generate agreement work order X days in advance |  When auto generate work orders is set to **Yes**, the system will generate work order records based on the recurrence schedule and the existing booking dates.

|  Pre/Post Booking Flexibility Date Field Population  | When defining an agreement, pre- and post-booking flexibility fields can be defined, which will define the dynamic window in which each work order should plan to be booked. This setting defines whether work orders generated from agreements will populate this window in the **Date Window Start** and **Date Window End** fields or the **Time From Promised** and **Time To Promised** fields. If set to **Populate Time From Promised/Time To Promised** then the _Pre and Post Booking Flexibility_ fields on the agreement will populate the **Time From Promised**/**Time To Promised** fields on the work order. When configured this way, the **Date Window Start** and **Date Window End** fields will be hidden from the work order form. If set to **Populate Date Window Start/Date Window End**, then the **Pre and Post Booking Flexibility** fields on the agreement will populate the **Date Window Start** and **Date Window End** fields on the work order.

## Intelligence settings

|  Options   |  Description   |  
|-------------|-----------------|  
| Enable suggested duration |  When enabled, this setting will look at historical booking data and suggest an average duration on a daily or on-demand basis at the incident type level to improve accuracy of an incident type's established duration.|
| Historical data filter | This setting is used for both the suggested duration and incident type suggestions functionality. This setting is used to establish the data scope for analysis when looking at historical data to provide suggestions.| 
| Enable incident type suggestion | When enabled, this setting will drive a prompt to ensure users are aware that this feature is in preview. If accepted, this feature will begin to drive analysis of historical work order and work order sub-record data to suggest ways to improve an organization's usage of incident type. Once enabled, a subgrid will become visible on the tab to show the suggestions from this intelligent analysis. From the subgrid, a user can dislike or apply the suggestions from the model.| 

## Time entry settings

|  Options  |  Description  |  
|-------------|--------------|  
| Time entry generation strategy | This setting drives whether the environment will automatically generate time entries based on bookings or not. If the setting is null, the system assumes manual generation. Regardless of whether this is set to manual or automatic generation, time entries can always be created manually.|
|Time Cost Actuals|Actuals are generated as part of the natural Field Service motion. Some actuals would be generated at various stages of the work order and invoice lifecycle. This field controls whether cost actuals related to time are generated from booking journals when the work order is set to "Closed - Posted" or from time entries when the time entry is marked as approved. If this setting is null, the system will assume it should generate these time and cost focused actuals from booking journals when the work order is "Closed - Posted."| 

## Dynamics 365 Remote Assist settings

|  Options  |  Description  |  
|-------------|-----------------|  
| Disable booking status changes  |   Depending on this setting, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens will either allow a booking's booking status to be changed from within the HoloLens experience or it will not. |
  
## Other settings
  
|   Options  |      Description     |
|------------|----------------------|
|  Entity number length  |   Enter the number of digits the entity numbers will be. For example, if you enter 5, the first work order number would be 00001.  |
| Auto allocate estimate products | When products are added to a work order before the work begins, then the line status of the work order product record defaults to **Estimated**. This setting determines whether the work order product record is set to **Allocated** when the line status is still **Estimated**, as opposed to **Used**. |
|  Auto geo code addresses |  Specify whether the system should automatically add the appropriate latitude and longitude values based on the account's address. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Turn on auto geocoding](../field-service/turn-on-auto-geocoding.md)   |
| Product cost order   | Select the order for product cost.   |
| Work order subgrid records open as popups | Specify if work order sub entities (work order product, work order service, work order service task, work order incident, bookable resource booking, time entry) should open as a popup overlay on top of the work order form, rather than navigating away. The default setting for this field will enable the subgrid records to open in dialog popups.  |
| Use enhanced background processing | When the Field Service app is installed, so too are many workflows that run in the background. This setting utilizes Power Automate flows in place of some of the background Dynamics 365 Field Service workflows. Power Automate has many benefits, including the ability to connect and run workflows within Dynamics 365 and between other outside applications, the ability to delete records and schedule jobs, and robust approvals, among others. For Field Service specifically, using Power Automate in place of background processes related to agreements improves performance for long-waiting agreements and fixes complications in the event an agreement's owner no longer has access to Dynamics 365 (if they leave the company, for example). For Field Service Mobile, you can use Power Automate for geofence, geofence alerts, and push notification process. For more information, see the article on [using Power Automate flows with Field Service Mobile](mobile-workflow-to-flow.md). This setting is in preview.|

> [!Note]
> The **Enhanced Background Processing** setting is in preview and it means that all Field Service workflows will move to Power Automate.

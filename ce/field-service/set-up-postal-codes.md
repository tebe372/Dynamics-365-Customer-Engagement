# Set up postal codes and relate them to service territories (Field Service)

Creating postal code records and relating them to service territories lets an account be automatically assigned to a service territory when the account address is entered. When a user tabs out of the postal code field on the account record form, the system automatically populates the service territory field if it finds a match to the postal code.  
  
 Postal codes can be assigned to territories, but it is not necessary for the territories feature to work.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can't have the same postal code assigned to multiple territories.  
  
1.  From the main menu, click **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Postal Codes**.  
  
2.  On the **Postal Codes** screen, click **+New** in the upper left corner.  
  
     Use the tooltips to help fill in your information, and then click **Save**.

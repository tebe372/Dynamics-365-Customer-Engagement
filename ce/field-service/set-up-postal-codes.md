# Set up postal codes and relate them to service territories in Dynamics 365 Field Service

Creating postal code records and relating them to service territories lets an account be automatically assigned to a service territory when the account address is entered. When a user tabs out of the postal code field on the account record form, the system automatically populates the service territory field if it finds a match to the postal code.  
  
 Postal codes can be assigned to territories, but it is not necessary for the territories feature to work.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can't have the same postal code assigned to multiple territories.  
  
1.  From the main menu, go to **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Postal Codes**.  
  
2.  On the **Postal Codes** screen, select **+New** in the upper-left corner.  
  
     Use the tooltips to help fill in your information, and then select **Save**.

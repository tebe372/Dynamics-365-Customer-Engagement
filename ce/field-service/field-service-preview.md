# Install preview features for Dynamics 365 Field Service

> [!Important]
> As of September 2020, there are no features currently available in preview for Field Service. All features previously available in preview are now available as early access. For more information, [learn more about opting into early access](/power-platform/admin/opt-in-early-access-updates#how-to-enable-early-access-updates). 

New Field Service capabilities are often available as a preview before they are generally available. Preview features are not intended for production usage as they may be changed before becoming generally available. By installing and learning preview features, you can better prepare for how your business can adopt them when they are generally available.

Follow the instructions in this article to manually add Field Service preview features to your testing and development environment.

Installing a preview solution will install Field Service and preview features. 


## Prerequisites

Find and note the **Org ID** of your Dynamics 365 environment you wish to add preview features to.

You can find the org ID in **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Developer Resources**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of developer resources in Field Service](./media/preview-orgid.png)

Make sure your PC computer has PowerShell installed. If not, [install it](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7).

## Step 1: Run PowerShell

Open PowerShell and **Run as Administrator**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the run as administrator option for PowerShell in the Windows start search.](./media/preview-powershell.png)

Here's an example of all the PowerShell commands we'll run; you can follow with the steps below. We recommend copying and pasting the following commands in a note that you can edit with your specific information for username, password, org ID and more.

```
    install-module Microsoft.Xrm.OnlineManagementAPI -Scope CurrentUser -force
    $user = “username@org.onmicrosoft.com”
    $password = “password”
    $cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($user, (ConvertTo-SecureString $password –ASPlainText –Force)) 
    $url = “https://admin.services.crm.dynamics.com”  
    Get-CrmFlights -ApiUrl $url -Credential $cred  
    Add-CrmFlightAudience -ApiUrl $url -FlightId "092718c6-8031-43f7-b957-2b2e662ebf46" -InstanceId "d9bee8b4-995f-4d78-83c0-8b55e471245d" -Credential $cred
```

## Step 2: Run command for security protocol

Run the following command:

```[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12```

## Step 3: Run command to install API

Run the following command:

```install-module Microsoft.Xrm.OnlineManagementAPI -Scope CurrentUser -force```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the PowerShell window, running as administrator.](./media/preview-powershell-run-first-command.png)

## Step 4: Run commands for username and password

Run the following command; be sure to substitute your own username. This username reflects a user with system administrator security role:

```$user = “user@org.onmicrosoft.com”```

Run the following command; substitute your own password:

```$password = “password”```

Run the following command:

```$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($user, (ConvertTo-SecureString $password –ASPlainText –Force))```

## Step 5: Run command for your URL

Next, check the article on [Service URLs](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/online-management-api/get-started-online-management-api#service-url).

Run the following command, substituting the service URL based on your environment's geography.

```$url = “https://admin.services.crm.dynamics.com”```

## Step 6: Run command to get preview flights

Run the following command:

```Get-CrmFlights -ApiUrl $url -Credential $cred```

If prompted, run software from an untrusted publisher by entering "R."

> [!Note]
> If you get the error *"\Microsoft.Xrm.OnlineManagementAPI.psm1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system"*, run the following PowerShell command: “Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope LocalMachine".

You'll see a list of preview features.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Windows PowerShell, showing a list of features in preview.](./media/preview-powershell-previewlist.png)

## Step 7: Find ID of preview flight

Find the preview feature you would like to add to your environment and note the ID. In our example, it's the ID for **FieldService_April2020_PreviewFlight**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Windows PowerShell, showing the FlightID and the InstanceID.](./media/preview-powershell-flightid-orgid.png)

Run the following command by substituting the ID of the preview feature found in PowerShell (seen under "1" in the previous screenshot) and the orgID of your environment you noted in the beginning (seen under "2" in the previous screenshot).

```
Add-CrmFlightAudience -ApiUrl $url -FlightId "bdccdf3c-da3b-4a0f-8d0f-69c20e7256cb" -InstanceId "01f3f249-d269-415f-b036-e52701c75adf" -Credential $cred
```

It will say **Added to Flight**.

## Step 8: Install or upgrade preview version of Field Service 

The following step applies to both installing Field Service in an environment without the app and upgrading existing versions to the preview version.

As a system administrator, go to [https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments/](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments/).

In the left pane, go to **Resources** > **Dynamics 365 apps** and find **Dynamics 365 Field Service** in the list.

Select the app and choose install.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of installing preview solution in Power Apps admin](./media/inspections-install.png)

Then select your environment from the list, agree to the terms of service, and select **Install**.

Back in the list of apps, you'll see it has a status "Installing..."

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Power Platform admin center, showing Field Service in the list of Dynamics 365 apps, installing.](./media/preview-admin5.jpg)

## Step 9: Verify preview flight is installed

Here is an example of the apps that may be in your Dynamics 365 environment *before* installing the preview flight.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Dynamics 365 apps page, showing a list of installed apps.](./media/preview-environment-before.png)

*After* the flight is installed, an upgraded version of the Field Service app will appear. If you did not have the Field Service app installed, the preview flight will install Field Service and the preview features. If you had the Field Service app installed, it will upgrade the Field Service app to include the preview features.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the Power Platform admin center, showing details for Field Service.](./media/preview-environment-after-powerapps-admin.png)

Select the Field Service app to access Field Service capabilities and the preview features.

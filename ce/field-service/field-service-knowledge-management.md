# Share information through knowledge articles

When technicians in the field work on assigned jobs, they need access to relevant information to solve the problems they encounter.

Knowledge management in Dynamics 365 Field Service associates relevant knowledge articles with work orders, incidents, products, and customer assets.

Access to knowledge articles help improve the fix rate and guide technicians through procedures.

## Create knowledge articles

Write a knowledge article to share information with technicians.

## Link knowledge articles to related entities

Create relationships between knowledge articles and other records, like incident types, products, or customer assets. When any of these records are added to a work order, the system automatically links the related knowledge articles.

1. Select an article. On the **Summary** tab, in the **Related Information** section, select the target entity for the relationship.

1. Select the vertical ellipsis &vellip; and choose **Add Existing Customer Asset**.

> [!TIP]
> You can also link knowledge articles without configured relationship to incidents, assets, or products. On a target record, go to the **Linked Articles** tab and select **New Linked Article**.

## View work order and knowledge articles on the mobile app

Technicians find the knowledge articles on work orders in the Field Service mobile app.  Knowledge articles are available while the device has internet connectivity. They aren't available while in the [offline mode](mobile-power-app-system-offline.md).

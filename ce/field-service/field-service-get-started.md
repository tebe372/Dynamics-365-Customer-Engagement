# Get started with Dynamics 365 Field Service

After you have [installed Dynamics 365 Field Service](install-field-service.md) and have [assigned Field Service licenses to your users](view-user-accounts-security-roles.md) who need to use the app, you can start adding your frontline workers and scheduling work orders. The best way to do this is to use the new **Getting Started** page, as seen in the following screenshot.

In the **Learn about Field Service** section, there are four cards with videos and links to documentation to help quickly learn about new features and capabilities in the current release. And for users new to Field Service, you'll also see key app functionality. With each release, we'll highlight new functionality in this **Getting Started** section, so be sure to check back regularly!

In the **Get up and running** section, there are a set of actions and tutorial videos that guide you through important Field Service processes, like: 

- Creating frontline workers (sometimes called technicians)
- Adding customers
- Creating work orders
- Scheduling work orders to frontline workers
- Analyzing your operations

Finally, at the end of the **Getting Started** page, there are links to helpful resources, including: 

- Support contacts to help with product questions
- Release plans to stay up to date with latest improvements and upcoming development

You can also send an email to the frontline worker, so that they can download the mobile app on their device. For more information about sending emails to frontline workers, see this article: [Send frontline workers an email with a link to download Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app](frontline-worker-set-up-email-approval.md).

## Create your accounts

Next, create an account that represents one of your customers. 

From the **Getting Started** page, Select **Create**.

In the form, fill out relevant details.

## Create your work orders

Create a work order that outlines work that needs to be done for a customer, typically at the customer's location or at the location of an asset or equipment. 

From the **Getting Started** page, select **Create**.

In the form, fill out relevant details.

## Schedule your work orders

Next, schedule the work order to a frontline worker. 

On the **Getting Started** page, select **Schedule** to go to the schedule board.

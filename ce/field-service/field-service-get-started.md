# Get started with Field Service

After you have [installed Dynamics 365 Field Service](install-field-service.md) and have assigned Field Service licenses to your users who need to use the app, you can get started with creating frontline workers and scheduling work orders. The best way to do this is to use the new _Getting Started_ page which can be found in the left navigation pane.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/gettingstarted1920.png)


At the top of the page you will see Field Service tours and videos.  Each release we will highlight new features, so it is easy to continuously transform your business by leveraging the best of Dynamics 365 Field Service today and tomorrow. We strongly encourage you to come back to the Get Started page.



In the middle of the page you will see a set of action cards that will guide you through the core Field Service processes, like creating frontline workers (also called technicians), customers, work orders, and finally scheduling work orders to frontline workers. See more details in this article below.

At the bottom of the page you will see links to release notes to stay up to date with the latest improvements, a support community forum to post questions, and an ideas forum to give product feedback.

## Prerequisites

- You must have either System Administrator or Field Service - Administrator privileges to see and use the _Get Started_ page.




## Set up your frontline workers

By the end of this getting started page you will have successfully scheduled a work order to a frontline worker to resolve a customer's issue. 


Start by creating a frontline worker who represents someone in your company who completes work orders. Select the **Set Up** button.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-flw1.png)

In the form that displays, enter required information. Recommended values are prepopulated and should not be changed unless necessary. 


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-flw2.png)

Optionally you can send an email to the frontline worker user to download the mobile app if [mailboxes are set up](frontline-worker-set-up-email-approval.md).

## Create your accounts

Next create an account that represents one of your customers. Select the **Create** button.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-account1.png)


Follow the form to enter relevant information.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-account2.png)

## Create your work orders

Create a work order that outlines work that needs to be done for a customer, typically at the customer's location or at the location of an asset or equipment. Select the **Create** button.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-wo1.png)

 Follow the form to enter relevant information. 
 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-wo2.png)

 The Service Account represents the customer who the work order relates to. 

 Tasks are a checklist of things that need to be done.

 Products are parts that may be needed to complete the work order.

 Services are labor items that may be needed to complete the work order.

## Schedule your work orders

The last step is to schedule the work order to a frontline worker who will complete it for the customer. Select the **Schedule** button to go to the schedule board.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-schedule1.png)

Find your work order in the lower pane and click and drag it to your frontline worker.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/getstarted-schedule2.png)

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the core scenario in Field Service.


## Next steps 

Next, set up the mobile app that frontline workers will use to view and complete work orders in the field. For more information, see the article on [getting started with the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](mobile-power-app-get-started.md).

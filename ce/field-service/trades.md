# Use Trades to group services

Trades let you group incident types in your preferred way.   Configure trades and trade coverages to simplify the creation of work orders and the services that are provided in a functional location or for a service account, or for accounts at locations. Using trades adds another layer of details to create reports and filter charts on reports.

## Activate Trade for your org

An admin must enable the capability before creating trades and trade coverages.
  
1. Go to Settings > General > Field Service Settings > Work Order/Booking tab.
2. Set Trade to On.
3. New settings options Trades and Trade coverages appear in the General section.

## Create trades

Before you can map incident types to a trade, an admin must define the trades that are available for your business.

1. Go to Settings > General > Trades.
2. Select New.
3. Name the trade and save it.

## Map trades to incident types

Group incident types by trade and create reports based on trades, an admin must configure the mapping. An incident type can map to one trade only.

1. Go to Settings > Work Orders > Incident Types.
2. Open the incident type record you want to map to a trade
3. On the Details tab, choose the value in the Trade field.

## Configure trade coverages

Trade coverage defines which trades are covered for an account or a location to ensure the right level of service is provided. For example, if a location doesn’t have air conditioning, it shouldn’t be possible to create an incident related to the AC (air conditioning) system for that location. The same logic applies to accounts if the service contract doesn’t include HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) maintenance.

1. Go to Settings > General > Trade coverages.
2. Select New.
3. Choose a trade and select an account, a functional location, or both.
4. Save the trade coverage.

Alternatively, you can also show Trade Coverage as a related entity to your Accounts and configure trade coverage from there. That way you can see trade coverage in conjunction with your service accounts and the trade coverage is automatically mapped to the right account.

## Validation of work orders

Depending on the configuration of trade coverages, new work orders will check if the selected account or functional location are covered. 
If trade coverage is set to not cover a trade, a warning will show on the work order. However, you can still save the work order. If no trade coverage is defined, no warnings will show.
The validation interprets service accounts and hierarchies in functional locations.

> [!NOTE]
> If no trade coverage is defined for a trade, the system assumes that the trade is covered for all parameters. Work order won’t show any warnings if trade coverage isn’t defined.

# Customization considerations for the work order form

This article lists common considerations when customizing the work order form in Dynamics 365 Field Service.

## Open work order subgrids as popups

Configure work order subentities to pop out as dialog boxes and edit them without having to leave the work order form. This configuration helps dispatchers keep the work order context. Administrators can enable the **Work Order Subgrid Records Open as Popups** setting in the settings area. For more information, go to [Other settings](configure-default-settings.md#other-settings).

## Show simplified work order commands

The work order ribbon uses the simplified view by default. It shows only the most relevant commands. An administrator can disable the **Show Simplified Work Order Commands** setting to show all commands. For more information, go to [Work Order / Booking settings](configure-default-settings.md#work-order--booking-settings).

Check out the following video on simplified work order commands and more updates to work orders.

## Custom work order statuses

Work order system statuses should *never* be edited because system jobs and plug-ins rely on these statuses. Instead, administrators can create custom work order substatuses that map to work order system statuses.

## Add Bing Maps to the work order form

If the Bing Maps control is manually removed from the out-of-the-box work order form, it can't be added back.

To enable Bing Maps button in form designer, at least one of the attributes of type address should have the mask *ValidForMap* added in the form.

```xml
<DisplayMask>ValidForAdvancedFind\|ValidForForm\|ValidForGrid\|ValidForMap</DisplayMask>
```

1. Create a solution on a sandbox environment that includes the form to which the Bing Maps control needs to be added. Export it as managed solution.

1. In the solution's `customizations.xml` file, go the `formxml` part of it.

1. Add the following maps control to the `<controlDescriptions>`.

```xml
        <controlDescription forControl="{8b67ae03-1701-54d2-09be-35295876ca8a}">

        <customControl id="{4273EDBD-AC1D-40d3-9FB2-095C621B552D}">

        <parameters>

        <datafieldname>msdyn\_mapcontrol</datafieldname>

        </parameters>

        </customControl>

        <customControl formFactor="0" name="MscrmControls.Map.MapControl">

        <parameters>

        <value>msdyn\_mapcontrol</value>

        <mapSourceSwitch isGroup="true" static="true">CoordinatesGroup</mapSourceSwitch>

        <latitude>msdyn\_latitude</latitude>

        <longitude>msdyn\_longitude</longitude>

        <addressEditableSwitch isGroup="true" static="true">isAddressEditableYesGroup</addressEditableSwitch>

        <outputLatitude>msdyn\_latitude</outputLatitude>

        <outputLongitude>msdyn\_longitude</outputLongitude>

        </parameters>

        </customControl>

        <customControl formFactor="1" name="MscrmControls.Map.MapControl">

        <parameters>

        <value>msdyn\_mapcontrol</value>

        <mapSourceSwitch isGroup="true" static="true">CoordinatesGroup</mapSourceSwitch>

        <latitude>msdyn\_latitude</latitude>

        <longitude>msdyn\_longitude</longitude>

        <addressEditableSwitch isGroup="true" static="true">isAddressEditableYesGroup</addressEditableSwitch>

        <outputLatitude>msdyn\_latitude</outputLatitude>

        <outputLongitude>msdyn\_longitude</outputLongitude>

        </parameters>

        </customControl>

        <customControl formFactor="2" name="MscrmControls.Map.MapControl">

        <parameters>

        <value>msdyn\_mapcontrol</value>

        <mapSourceSwitch isGroup="true" static="true">CoordinatesGroup</mapSourceSwitch>

        <latitude>msdyn\_latitude</latitude>

        <longitude>msdyn\_longitude</longitude>

        <addressEditableSwitch isGroup="true" static="true">isAddressEditableYesGroup</addressEditableSwitch>

        <outputLatitude>msdyn\_latitude</outputLatitude>

        <outputLongitude>msdyn\_longitude</outputLongitude>

        </parameters>

        </customControl>

        </controlDescription>

```

1. Search for "Bing Maps" in the same file.

1. Add the control with the following code to the row and cell wherever it needs to be added.

```xml
    <control disabled="false" id="msdyn\_mapcontrol" classid="{F9A8A302-114E-466A-B582-6771B2AE0D92}" uniqueid="{8b67ae03-1701-54d2-09be-35295876ca8a}" datafieldname="msdyn\_mapcontrol"/>
```

1. Save the file and create a new managed solution zip file out of it.

1. Import the solution to the affected environment.

> [!TIP]
>Â If the map control is still not visible on the form after following these steps, try removing the active form customizations.

## Components in the new work order experience (preview)

The new work order experience in the 2023 release wave 2 introduces several new components for makers to use on their forms. Unless stated differently, you can't customize the components.

The following components are added:

- Work order grid (*msdyn_FieldService.WorkOrderList*) with customizable columns.
- Functional location card (*msdyn_FieldService.LocationCard*) that works on the work order entity only.
- Dynamics bookings card (*msdyn_FieldService.BookingCard*) that works on the work order entity only.
- Contact card (*msdyn_FieldService.CustomerContactCard*) where you can customize the mapping of the *Reported by contact* field.
- Asset card (*msdyn_FieldService.WorkOrderAssetTree*).
- Products and services summary card (*msdyn_FieldService.LineItemsTabSummaryCard*). The mapping of fields only works for *CostNotToExceed* to *msdyn_costntepercent* and *PriceNotToExceed* to *pricentepercent*.
- Products and services line items grid (*msdyn_FieldService.LineItemsTabTable*) which you can use on custom views for products or services. To enable filtered results for products, edit the control and set the data source to *Records: Only Related Records*, *Entity: Work Order Products (Work Order)*, and *Default View: LineItemsTab Active Products*.
- Task summary card (*msdyn_FieldService.TasksAtAGlanceCard*).
- Task list (*msdyn_FieldService.TasksGrid*).
- References card (*msdyn_FieldService.ReferenceDisplay*) which can show knowledge articles, guides from tasks, or media references. The maximal size of the media files is 100 MB.

# Work with the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app

The Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app enables technicians to view and update work orders, customer assets, accounts, and more on the go. You can download the app for all major platforms for free. A Field Service user license and user permissions are required to work with the app.

The following articles describe how frontline workers or technicians get the most out of the mobile application. They describe the main features and list guiding principles: 

- [Download the mobile app and get started](download-get-started-mobile-app.md)

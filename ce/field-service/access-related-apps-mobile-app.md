# Access related apps form the Field Service (Dynamics 365) Mobile app

## IoT data from Connected Field Service

Organizations using Connected Field Service to track their IoT devices find a subset of that information readily available in the mobile app. For more information, see [Connected Field Service for the Field Service (Dynamics 365) Mobile app](cfs-mobile-powerapp.md).

Technicians can view and interact with IoT data and IoT actions like pulling live device data or registering new devices in the mobile app.

## Embedded Guides in Field Service (Dynamics 365) Mobile (preview)

If your organization uses Dynamics 365 Guides, you can use the Field Service (Dynamics 365) Mobile application to access guides from mobile devices. If Guides uses the same environment as Field Service, users find a **Library** option at the bottom of the app. Select it to access your organization's guides library, search for specific guides, and follow them step by step.

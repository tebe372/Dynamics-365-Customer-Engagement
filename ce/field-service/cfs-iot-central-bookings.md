# 4 - Send booking updates to Azure IoT Central

Now that you've configured Connected Field Service to send service updates back to IoT Central, let's make it so booking details are sent back too.

## Goal
Make Connected Field Service send booking updates to Azure IoT Central when a resource is booked in Connected Field Service.

## Steps
1. Head over to the [Power Automate templates page](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/templates/) and search for the following template: "**[Sample Contoso] When a technician is booked in Connected Field Service, update Azure IoT Central with the details.**"

2. Once you've selected the template, you'll be asked to sign in with both your Dynamics 365 account and Azure IoT Central account.

3. Like with work order updates in step 3 of this tutorial, this Flow template will be mostly ready-to-go. To get it working, you need to update the following (see screenshots below for reference):

    a. Add your D365 organization name in the corresponding fields in **Get the work order**, **Get the alert**, and **Get the resource details**.

    b. Add your IoT Central application name in the field for **Application**.

4. Save the flow.

5. Head on back to your Field Service environment and open the schedule board. Find a resource that matches your IoT requirements, based on criteria such as location and alert type. Confirm the booking for the work order that was generated in response to the IoT alert.

## See the results

Back in Azure IoT Central, you'll now see booking information associated with this device, such as technician name, estimated arrival time, and estimated service duration.

You've now completed the tutorials. Nice work.

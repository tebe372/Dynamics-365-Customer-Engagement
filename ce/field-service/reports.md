# Field Service reports overview

Resource and operations managers can monitor key operational metrics to gauge the performance of resources and their scheduling strategy. Reports can help explore important business-related questions, such as:

- Are my resources being utilized efficiently over a given time period?
- What is the average discrepancy between estimated and actual completion times for tasks and work orders?
- Are tasks and resources being matched effectively?

With answers to these questions, scheduling managers can develop an effective resource scheduling strategy and that saves cost and time and improves customer experiences.

Dynamics 365 Field Service and the Resource Scheduling Optimization add-in provide reports that focus on different scenarios and user needs:

1. The [Resource and Utilization report](resource-utilization-report.md), which is included with Field Service.
1. The [Work Order Summary report](work-order-summary-report.md), which is included with Field Service.
1. The [Admin report](rso-admin-report.md), included with the Resource Scheduling Optimization add-in.
1. The [Optimization Summary report](optimization-summary-report.md), included with the Resource Scheduling Optimization add-in.


By default, reports are only available to users with **System Administrator** or **Field Service-Administrator** security roles. However, admins can share the reports with other users in their organization.

# Work order summary reports in Dynamics 365 Field Service (public preview)

Operations managers are responsible for managing work orders in order to provide timely support for their customers. To better understand what actions may be needed for better field service performance, these managers need to be able to monitor key operational metrics. 

Reports in Dynamics 365 Field Service can help you get a birds-eye understanding of ongoing work across your organization, such as: 

- The number of open work orders at any given point in time
- Average time to complete a work order
- Average time it takes for technicians to travel to a customer location
- Whether or not you are meeting customer expectations around travel time or other needs
- How an individual technician performs on all key metrics
- Insights around specific territories, from work order volume to travel time and more

> [!Note]
> Work order summary reports are released in April 2020 as part of a public preview. Follow the process in the article on [installing or upgrading preview features](field-service-preview.md). In Step 6, look for the preview flight with the display name **FieldService_April2020_PreviewFlight**.

## Reports overview

To find reports, go to **Field Service** > **Service** > **Analytics and Insights** > **Reports (Preview)**.

## View and filter reports

You can filter reports by the following criteria: 

- **Customer** 
- **System status**
- **Work order type**
- **Substatus**
- **Service territory**
- **Technician**
- **Date range**

See the following screenshot of the work order summary report for reference.

## Refresh reports
The information in reports is refreshed every 24 hours. You may see a yellow, triangular warning icon next to the label **Last refresh (UTC)** in the top-right of the report. This icon indicates whether there is a delay or issue with the data refresh. If the data has not been refreshed in the last 24 hours, you'll see a tooltip message when you hover over the icon.

|    Refresh   status                       |    Indicator   Icon    |    Tooltip   message                                                                                                                       |

|    Missed SLA (>24 hours)               |    Visible             |    Due to the delay with the refresh process, the data set has not been refreshed and you can reach out to your system administrator.    |

## Share reports

By default, the tenant administrator will be able to view all the reports, but by following the below steps, they can also share reports with other users or teams.

1. To share a report, select **Share** in the top-right corner of the report. 
 
2. Select the **Work order summary** report.

3. Select **Share**.

4. Select **Add User/Team** and then choose the user you want to share the report with.

    ![Screenshot showing the add user or team option on the share reports screen.](./media/report-share.png)

5. Make sure the **Read** access is selected and then select **Share**.

    ![Screenshot showing the share window with emphasis on the read box being checked.](./media/report-share-read-checked.png)

The user or team you selected will now be able to see the report. 

## Additional notes

- We don't support environment minimal copy operations available for sandbox environments. If you perform any of these operations, you may encounter unexpected results.
- Data is refreshed every 24 hours. Reports will continue to be available during the refresh. If the reports are not refreshed within 24 hours, you can contact Microsoft Support. Note that currently, we do not support a custom refresh schedule.
- Data refresh for inactive environments: if there's no active usage of the reports for two continuous weeks, the data refresh will pause. When a report is opened, the data will be refreshed in the next refresh cycle.
- Report filters will not persist.
- In **Resource and Utilization**, the **Next** control in the date range is not currently operational.
- Currently, we don't support report customizations.
- Data retention lasts for 24 months.
- Data availability for entities: Field Service uses the following list of entities to generate these reports. If there is no data for any of the following entities, then the report may appear blank. If you have customized these entities or if you're not using the out-of-box entities, then the reports will show blank too.

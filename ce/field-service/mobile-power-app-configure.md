# Edit Sitemap entities (tables) on the home screen

Sign in to Dynamics 365 as a system administrator.

To see your list of apps, go to:

`https://[YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME].crm.dynamics.com/main.aspx?forceUCI=1&pagetype=apps`

Find the Field Service Mobile app and go to the **App Designer**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Dynamics 365, showing the list of apps and showing the option to open Field Service Mobile in the App Designer.](./media/mobile-2020-admin-app-designer.png)

Select the edit icon to edit the site map.

The groups  **My Work**, **Customers**, and **Other** correspond with the home screen of the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app and you can rearrange, delete, or edit the display names.

Rearrange the entities displayed within each group with the drag and drop interface, or add new entities by adding new **Subareas**.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Power Apps, showing the My Work, Customers, and Other groups on the Field Service Mobile App Designer.](./media/mobile-2020-admin-sitemap2.png)

You can even create entirely new groups with more subareas to display different entities.

> [!Note]
> For every entity you display in the sitemap, you can choose the views available on mobile in the App Designer.

# Resource scheduling and optimization analytics dashboard

Resource manager or operation manager are responsible for managing the resources who work onsite to provide support on customer needs no matter it is a break-fix or a regular maintenance ask.  They need to be able to monitor key operational metrics to gauge resource and scheduling performance. The reports can uncover business questions as whether resources are being effectively utilized over a period time and, as a whole, what is the variance between estimated and actual time and whether requirements and allocated resource are balanced.  So, they can fine turn the resource scheduling strategy and provide appropriate guidance to resources, and ultimately that will lead to savings in time, money and continues improvement on customer experience. 

  
This Public preview contains three reports focused on different scenarios and user personas - “Resource and Utilization”, “RSO Admin” and “Optimization summary”. 

Resource Manager can use Resource and Utilization report to perform the following tasks:  

- Monitor metrics across resource and utilization, time spent on bookings and miles on truck rolls.   
- Unpack insights on the territory as a whole; what is the allocation of bookings, is territory imbalance between demand and supply, what is the estimated travel time versus the actual travel time?  
- Understand how individual resource is using their time to react and resolve and whether individual resource is under or over utilized comparing to others.  

Resource Manager can use RSO Admin and Optimization summary reports to perform the following tasks:     

- A post-analysis to provide recap of each optimization request such as number of requirements, number of bookings, allocated hours and least allocated resource.  

Note: Contact your system administrator, for configuration errors or if you are unable to view the dashboards.

# Create IoT Alerts and convert IoT Alerts into work orders

IoT alerts are a subset of IoT messages that may require attention. 


// https://msit.microsoftstream.com/video/7a11a1ff-0400-b564-2c53-f1eb658dc97a

In this doc we will review how IoT alerts are triggered, how to view IoT Alerts in Field Service, and then how to create work orders based on the IoT Alerts. 

## Trigger IoT Alerts in Azure IoT Hub 

As IoT messages flow into Azure IoT Hub, you can create rules that dicatate when IoT alerts should be created based on the IoT messages.



> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/cfs-iot-alert-stream-analytics1.png)

View and edit the criteria in Stream Analytics in your Resource Group.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/cfs-iot-alert-stream-analytics.png)

Go to Query in the left pane then select **IoTStream**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/cfs-iot-alert-stream-analytics2.png)

**(1)** the bottom pane shows all incoming IoT messages from the connected device 

**(2)** the top pane shows the JSON that creates IoT Alerts from IoT messages.




### Trigger IoT Alerts with the simulator

Field Service is deployed with simulated IoT messages and rules that create IoT Alerts.

Find the simulator by going to the Simulator App Service resource in your IoT Hub resource group. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/cfs-iot-alert-simulator1.png)

The go to the simualtor URL. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/cfs-iot-alert-simulator2.png)




> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of ](./media/cfs-iot-alert-simulator3.png)

> [!Note]
> **Not using Azure IoT Hub?** Creating IoT Alerts in Field Service based on IoT messages in your custom IoT provider is supported. See the topic on [Extensible IoT data sources for Connected Field Service](cfs-custom-iot-provider.md) for more details.

# Enable push notifications

In the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app, push notifications allow you to send updates to technicians through their mobile phones or tablets. Push notifications utilize Power Automate and can be triggered by many scenarios. 

Push notifications can be used to:

- Notify technicians they have been assigned a booking.
- Remind technicians to enter important business data.

For more information, see the [Power Apps mobile push notification documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/mobile/power-apps-mobile-notification).

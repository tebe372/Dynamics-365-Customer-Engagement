# Overview of Field Service Integrations


Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service integrates with various business applications to streamline your field serivce data and operations. 


## Integrate with Supply Chain Management
While Dynamics 365 Field Service includes basic inventory capabilities for managing frontline worker truck stock, tracking asset service history, requesting purchase orders, and documenting returns; many field service organizations still integrate Field Service with their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Organizations using the Microsoft Dynamics 365 stack will find it easy to integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management systems. By leveraging Microsoft Dataverse (formerly Common Data Service), you can set up a synchronous two-way integration, see the topic on [Integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service and Supply Chain Management](supply-chain-field-service-integration.md) to learn more. 



## Integrate with Remote Assist 

If your organization is using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, frontline workers can trigger a mixed reality video call from the Field Service mobile app or their HoloLens. This connects the frontline worker with a remote knowledge worker who can share their expertise and ultimately increase the chances of fixing the issue on the first trip. See the topic on [collaborate in mixed reality with Field Service, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/field-service/remote-assist-hololens) to learn more.



## Integrate with D365 Guides 
Integration with Dynamics 365 Guides lets Field Service customers attach mixed reality guides to Field Service tasks. When work orders are assigned to technicians, the technicians can use a dedicated Field Service tab in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app to launch the assigned guide and get their work done. Check this doc Integrate Field Service with Dynamics 365 Guides | Microsoft Docs to learn more

## Integrate with SAP 
Integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service with SAP C-4Hana and SAP S-4Hana to connect your work order scheduling system to your ERP system. Microsoft offers guidance for integrating Field Service with the SAP Planned Maintenance and SAP Industry-Specific Utility (IS-U) modules. Integration is done by connecting SAP to the Common Data Model, which Field Service is built on, along with other Dynamics 365 modules. Find more details in the Microsoft consulting services GitHub repository, which hosts materials created and updated by Microsoft, but open to ISVs and SIs to improve and build upon as part of the Open Data Initiative.

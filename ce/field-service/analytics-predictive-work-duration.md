# Predictive work duration and resource proficiency suggestions in Dynamics 365 Field Service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is intended to help dispatchers or admins enhance their teamâ€™s performance and improve customer satisfaction. This feature is not intended for use in making, and should not be used to make, decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring, recording, and storing communications with end users. This also includes adequately notifying end users that their communications with agents may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their agents that their communications with end users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.


Field service dispatchers often assign a fixed duration for a job type, despite various factors that may impact the time required to complete the work. Using a fixed duration can potentially cause cascading delays or lower utilization, reducing the overall effectiveness of scheduling.

With predictive work duration, dispatchers can predict the duration of any given booking or requirement, based on factors like:

- Resource performance
- Incident type
- Customer (service account)
- Work order type
- Territorial differences
- Time-related changes

Powered by artificial intelligence models, predictive work durations learn from historical booking completion times in order to compute a more realistic duration.

In this article, we'll take a look at how to setup and use predictive work durations in Field Service.

## Prerequisites

- This feature is only available in non-trial instances of Field Service.
- As of October 2020, this feature is in public preview. To turn on the preview, go to **Settings**. Under the **Analytics and insights** section, select **Settings** > 
**Enable Predictive Work Duration preview**. 
- Enter a number in the **Minimum number of resources per territory** field. Minimum number of resources in a territory lets you set restrictions on analyses and reports. If the value is set to 10, territories that have 10 or fewer resources will be excluded from territory analyses and reports; the limitation can help protect technician privacy.

Enabling predictive work duration will give you access to three reports:

- Upcoming work duration
- Territory duration
- Resource duration

Let's take a look at each report.

## Upcoming work duration

You'll find the upcoming work duration report under **Resources** > **Analytics and Insights** > **Predictive duration (preview)**.

### Metrics

Within the charts previously listed, you'll find the following information.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Confidence** | How likely the actual duration will be close to the predicted duration. A higher score (closer to 100%) signifies a better chance of the prediction being correct, while lower score (close to 0%) means the prediction may be incorrect. |
|**Prediction Factors** |  Insights into factors that were considered when predicting the duration and how they affect the prediction. |

## Territory duration

From the upcoming work duration report, you'll see another tab, where you can find the **Territory duration** report.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the territory duration report.](./media/analytics-work-duration-territory.png)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the same territory duration report, showing additional information.](./media/analytics-work-duration-territory2.png)

### Filters (slicers)

Like with the upcoming work duration report, the territory duration report has a few ways to filter information:

- **Duration**: Lists pre-defined values to filter by duration. Options are: 
  - Last 3 months
  - Last 6 months
  - Last 1 year
  - Last 2 years
- **Incident type**: Filter by incident types.
- **Territory**: Filter by service territories.
- **Customer**: Filters the territory report by customer.

### Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Beneath the filters, you'll see some key performance indicators. 

| Label | Description |
|----------|----------|
| **Number of resources** |	Shows number of resources involved in bookings. |
| **Number of bookings** | Shows number of completed bookings. | 
| **Overestimated bookings** | Shows number of bookings that are overestimated compared with actual duration. | 
| **Underestimated bookings** | Shows number of bookings that are underestimated compared with actual duration. | 
| **Overall proficiency score**	| Overall Al proficiency across all territories |

### Charts

The following charts can be found in the territory duration report.

| Label | Description |
|----------|----------|
| **Booking volume** | 	Shows number of bookings over the chosen filters (duration, territory, etc.).| 
| **Booking duration**	| Compares over and under estimated bookings over the chosen filters (duration, territory, etc.).
| **Customer metrics**	|  Shows bookings, difference, and over and under estimates by customer. | 
| **Incident type metrics** | Shows jobs completed, estimated duration, average duration, difference, proficiency score, confidence, and proficiency factors by incident type. |

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the resource duration report, showing additional information.](./media/analytics-resource-duration2.png)


### Key performance indicators (KPIs)

At the top of the report, you'll see the following key performance indicators.

| Label | Description | 
| -------|---------|
| **Number of resources**	| Shows number of resources involved in bookings. |
| **Number of bookings**	| Shows number of completed bookings. | 
| **Overestimated bookings**	| Shows number of bookings that are overestimated compared with actual duration. | 
| **Underestimated bookings**	| Shows number of bookings that are underestimated compared with actual duration.

### Charts

You'll find the following charts on the resource duration reports.

| Label | Description |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Booking volume**	| Shows number of bookings over the chosen period. | 
| **Booking duration**| Compares over- and underestimated bookings over the period. |
| **Resource metrics** | Shows the number of jobs completed by resource.|

| **Confidence**  | How likely the proficiency score calculated from the samples is close to the true proficiency score. A higher score indicates the proficiency score being closer to the truth and a lower score indicates the proficiency score being farther away from the truth.   |
| **Proficiency factors** | Summary of factors such as incident types, service accounts, day of week, and skills and rating match that contribute to the efficiency score. |

## Provide access to a security role

By default, only administrators have access to the resource duration report; administrators can provide access to others through security roles.

In Field Service, go to **Advanced Settings**.

Go to **Settings** > **Security**.

Go to **Security Roles**.

Select the security role that needs access to the reports (for instance, **Field Service â€“ Dispatcher**). 

Go to the **Customer Entities**. 

Select an entity. For example, "Resource duration (preview)."  

**Save and Close**. Now the **Field Service - Dispatcher** will see the resource analytics (preview) report. 

Follow these steps for any role that needs access. The three record types we have enabled as part of predictive work duration are:

- Resource analytics (preview)
- Predictive duration (preview)
- Field Service historical analytics

## Configuration considerations

- The setting **Minimum number of resources in a territory** lets you set restrictions on analyses and reports. If the value is set to 10, territories that have 10 or fewer resources will be excluded from territory analyses and reports; the limitation can help protect technician privacy.

## Additional notes

### Understanding estimated duration, actual duration, and predicted duration

- **Estimated duration**: How much time your organization expects a job to take. In the system, the value comes from the duration (msdyn_duration) of the resource requirement. The duration of the resource requirement is derived from the total duration of all work order incident types.

- **Actual duration**: How much time was spent working on a requirement. This value is calculated by _End time_ of booking minus the _actual arrival time_ of booking minus the *On break* duration of the booking journal related to the booking (formally called the **Bookable** Resource Booking).

- **Predicted duration**: How much time the AI model "thinks" the job will take based on historical information.

### Disabling custom actions 

**msdyn_AnalyticsSaveDataInConfigStore custom action**

Do not disable this custom action because insights and analytics features in Dynamics 365 will not function properly; the **msdyn_AnalyticsSaveDataInConfigStore custom action** is for internal use only. Contact Microsoft support if you have any questions.

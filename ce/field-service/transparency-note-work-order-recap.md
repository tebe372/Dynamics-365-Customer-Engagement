# Transparency note for work order recap with copilot

This transparency note describes the AI impact of the Dynamics 365 Field Service work order recap feature.

## What is work order recap?

[Describe the system in plain English. What type of system is this? What does it do? At a high level, what does the system take as input? What kind of outputs does the system produce?]

## What are the system’s capabilities?

[Building on the previous question, provide semi-technical, high-level information on how the system offers functionality for various uses.]

## What is the system’s intended use?

[Explain intended use(s), as identified in your Impact Assessment.]

## How was [Feature] evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

[Provide evidence of system accuracy and performance as well as a description of the extent to which these results are generalizable across use cases that were not part of the evaluation.]

## What are the limitations of [Feature]? How can users minimize the impact of the [Feature] limitations when using the system?

[See Impact Assessment. Describe the known limitations of the system including uses for which the system was not designed or evaluated. Discuss steps that the user can take to minimize errors and the impact of trade-offs for the user.]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the system?

[Describe the operational factors and ranges within which the system is expected to perform reliably and safely. List the choices that end users can make (e.g., customization, settings, etc.), with a description of how those choices may impact system behavior in the real world.]

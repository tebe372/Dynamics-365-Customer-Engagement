# Transparency note for work order recap with copilot

This transparency note describes the AI impact of the Dynamics 365 Field Service work order recap feature.

## What is work order recap?

The AI-Powered work order recap feature provides a succinct summary of a work order and its related contextual data. This feature is designed to help service managers, dispatchers, and frontline workers quickly understand the current state of a work order, including its past developments, future actions, arrival times, work criticality, and parts used or to be used.

## What are the system’s capabilities?

The system then pulls relevant data based on the status of the work order to create the recap. The recap includes a summary of the work order, booking details, activities, notes, products, services, and service tasks involved in the work order. Additional information, such as requirement characteristics, asset details, and invoice information, may be included based on the work order's current system status.

## What is the system’s intended use?

[Explain intended use(s), as identified in your Impact Assessment.]

## How was [Feature] evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

[Provide evidence of system accuracy and performance as well as a description of the extent to which these results are generalizable across use cases that were not part of the evaluation.]

## What are the limitations of [Feature]? How can users minimize the impact of the [Feature] limitations when using the system?

[See Impact Assessment. Describe the known limitations of the system including uses for which the system was not designed or evaluated. Discuss steps that the user can take to minimize errors and the impact of trade-offs for the user.]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the system?

[Describe the operational factors and ranges within which the system is expected to perform reliably and safely. List the choices that end users can make (e.g., customization, settings, etc.), with a description of how those choices may impact system behavior in the real world.](tbd.md)

# Field Resource Hub User's Guide (Field Service)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Field Resource Hub app lets field techs do basic tasks in the field like, view upcoming appointments, view and edit bookings, complete service tasks including adding products, notes and signatures. Field techs can also submit time-off requests so a dispatcher knows when the tech isn’t available.  

**Available anywhere, on any device**

There are two flavors of Field Service app. If you’re using a desktop browser, you’ll use the Dynamics 365 for Field Service app. If you’re a field tech using a smartphone or tablet, you’ll use the Field Resource Hub app which is a subset of the Field Service app. The Field Resources Hub app is built on the Unified Interface framework, which uses responsive web design principles to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience for any screen size, device, or orientation.

## Set up Field Service
The purpose of this section is to help you set up a Field Service environment and configure the core Field Service scenario.  

### Set up an environment
This includes deploying an environment, setting up users, and performing initial administrative actions. 

[Install Field Service (web + mobile)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/install-field-service)

[Setup Users and Security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/view-user-accounts-security-roles)

[Perform initial configurations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/perform-initial-configurations-setup)

### Configure Work Order Scenario
This includes creating a work order, scheduling it to a resource, and viewing it on the Field Service Mobile app.

[Quickstart - Create and schedule a work order](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/quickstart-schedule-work-order)

Additionally, configuring the core Field Service scenario involves understanding resources, work orders, scheduling, and the mobile app.

#### Resources

#### Work Orders

#### Scheduling

#### Mobility
[Installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/install-field-service#download-the-field-service-mobile-app-on-a-phone-or-tablet)

[Configure and customize](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/mobile-app-configuration-customization)

[Get started with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service Mobile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-get-started-with-microsoft-dynamics-365-for-field-service-mobile/)

[Deliver a customized mobile experience in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-deliver-a-customized-mobile-experience/)

## Configure more scenarios
The purpose of this section is to help you explore all the features of Field Service and configure more detailed scenarios and business requirements.

Start with this [Learn course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/implementing-dyn365-field-service/) that shows an administrative view of the previous work order scenario to create products, services, incidents and other core work order entities.  

### Scheduling
Next, dive into configuring the schedule board and exploring other scheduling capabilities such as crews, facilities, and pools with this [Learn course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/universal-resource-scheduling/)

### Agreements, assets & inventory

After that, look into using [Agreements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/set-up-customer-agreements) to auto generate recurring work orders, [Customer Assets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/configure-set-up-customer-assets) to build service history, and [Inventory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/create-warehouse) to track parts usage from a field technicians truck.  


### Resource Scheduling Optimization
The pinnacle of field service scheduling is Resource Scheduling Optimization (RSO) that automatically schedules work orders (and other requirements) to the best resources to minimize total travel time and maximize working hours and more based on your choice.

Learn how to [deploy, configure, and run RSO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/rso-overview). 


### Connected Field Service

Similarly, the pinnacle of work order creation is Connected Field Service (CFS) that combines AzureIoT and Dynamics to analyze data streams from Internet-connected equipment and proactively create work orders oftentimes before the customer is aware of a problem.

First, get an [Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/connected-field-service) of CFS and learn about the [CFS with IoTHub architecture](../customer-engagement/field-service/developer/connected-field-service-architecture) to better understand how Azure and Dynamics work together.

Next, learn the difference between CFS with [IoTCentral](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/cfs-iot-overview) and CFS with [IoTHub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/developer/connected-field-service-developer-guide). In short, think of **IoTCentral** as the Saas option, an easy way to create and demonstrate a protoype, perform a proof-of-concept, test the IoT process with dynamics to outline structure and objectives, and implement CFS for organizations starting from scratch with no IoT infrastructure. In contrast, think of **IoTHub** as the platform offering and what will most likely be implemented because it is more customizable and is especially helpful for organizations with existing IoT infrastructure.

**Pro Tip:** Combining Resource Scheduling Optimization and Connected Field Service enables an organization to proactively detect issues and schedule them to field technicians to fix them.

## Implement Field Service

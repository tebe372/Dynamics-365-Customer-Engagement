# Scheduling Roles and Personas

A key prerequisite to successful scheduling adoption is having the right people, with the right skills in the right roles at a field service organization.

## Dispatcher / scheduler

This role is responsible for ensuring the appropriate work orders (requirements/demand) are matched with the right resources (capacity) to create bookings in a given timeslot. This role can be performed by people in a variety of positions (e.g service manager, customer service rep, dispatcher/scheduler).

Scheduler responsibilities can range between manually assigning all requirements, having the system automatically schedule all requirements and simply managing exceptions, or somewhere in between. 

**A manual approach** would be to drag and drag requirements to resources' time slots.

**A semi-automated approach** would be to use the Schedule Assistant tool that recommends available and most appropriate resources.

**A fully automated approach** would be to adopt Resource Scheduling Optimization that automatically schedules requirements to the best resources based on predefined rules. Using more automated scheduling can lead to a reduction in the scheduler/resource ratios.

That said, in practice there are always people performing the scheduling role, if even just to help manage exceptions. This is consistent across the industry and is supported by guidance from [industry analysts](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AhAjbOq5aB_lqUSVN-G0tXLUXzQn).  Even with a high level of automation, schedulers are involved to help ensure optimization is meeting business objectives.

## Scheduling Analyst

The role is an emerging role as organizations adopt advanced scheduling functions (optimization, automated scheduling, analytics). The ideal scheduling analyst has a mix of dispatch/scheduling knowledge and analytics/optimization knowledge.

This person owns the optimization schedules with accompanying scope, goals, and parameters.

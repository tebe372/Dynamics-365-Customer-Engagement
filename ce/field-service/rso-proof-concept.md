# Setting up a proof of concept for Resource Scheduling Optimization

Setting up a proof of concept for Resource Scheduling Optimization should follow some basic guidance, and include: 

1. **Discovery**, where you learn about customer needs and expectations


2. **Initial configuration of RSO**, and knowing which entities are critical for a successful POC


3. **Running simulations of data,** which shows the POC in action


4. **Presenting results of the POC**, which can help your customer understand how working with RSO can benefit their organizations

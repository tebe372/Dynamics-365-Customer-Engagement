# Set up bookable resource categories

Bookable resource categories let you group your bookable resources by type. For example, you can create categories like technician, supervisor, subcontractor, vehicle, or equipment.  
  
1.  From the main menu, go to **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Bookable Resource Categories**.  
  
2.  On the **Active Resource Categories** screen, select **+New** in the upper left corner.  
  
3.  Use the tooltips to help fill in your information, and then **Save**.

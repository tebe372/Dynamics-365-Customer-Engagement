# Track a technician on the Field Service portal

Provide your customers with automated service reminders and notifications that include estimated technician arrival times. Reminders help your customers better plan their time around service visits.

<!--TODO: Track a tech is GA but only work for bookings through the portal, right? I'd like to call out specifically about the state of the feature. If it can be used with other features in Field Service, we need to mention that. If it only works with the portal, it's kind of pointless to call this a GA feature because it would not have any benefit for orgs don't want to try the portal as long as it's preview.-->

- **Enable Map**: Choose if the map shows for service appointments in the self-scheduling portal.

- **Show Resource Name**: When the technician is traveling, the portal and notifications show the name of the technician as defined in their Field Service user record.

- **Show Resource Image**: When the technician is traveling, the portal shows an image of the technician, if available.

- **Show Resource Phone**: When the technician is traveling, a phone icon shows in the portal. Customers can call or text the technician. This interaction will use the *Main Phone* value configured for the technician, if available.

## Test the experience as a customer

To review and test changes, set up an account and contact as if you were one of your customers. This procedure also lets you test rescheduling and cancellations of a booking through the portal.

1. Create a test account in Field Service with an address local to your area.
2. Create a test contact in Field Service with an email address and mobile phone number.
3. Assign the contact as the primary contact of the test account you created.
4. Create a work order related to the service account you created.
5. Create a booking for the work order, and set the status to *Scheduled*. Set the start date within the range of the booking reminder notification.
6. Assign a resource to the booking. The resource needs access to the Field Service mobile app and have location sharing enabled.
7. After saving the booking, you should receive an email and/or SMS notification to the email address and phone number of the test contact. Follow the link the notification to review the portal, and you'll find a map showing the location of the service account.
8. Change the booking status to *Traveling*. You'll receive a second email or SMS notification. This notification includes a map showing the current location of the technician and their estimated arrival time to the service account location.
9. Finally, change the booking status to *Complete*, which will trigger the booking complete notification.

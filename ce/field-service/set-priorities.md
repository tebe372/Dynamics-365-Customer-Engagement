# Prioritize your work orders in Dynamics 365 Field Service

Priority records let you prioritize your work orders. You can also assign each priority value a custom color, which will display in the outline of the resource booking time slot on the schedule board. This allows dispatchers to visually distinguish a job's priority while managing the schedule.  
  
1.  From the main menu, select **Field Service** > **Administration**, and then choose **Priorities**.  
  
2.  On the **Active Priorities** screen, select **+New** in the upper left corner.  
  
3.  Use the tooltips to help you fill in your information, and then select **Save**.

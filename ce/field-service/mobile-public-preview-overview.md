# Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app Public Preview

## Public Preview availability
In July 2023, weâ€™re introducing the public preview of a **new Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile experience for frontline technicians** to swiftly access all the information they need on the go. This modern user experience supports familiar mobile navigation, gestures and controls to streamline managing work order Tasks, Services, and Products. 

From changing the status of a booking with a quick swipe to accessing driving directions to a customer site with one tap, the redesign saves valuable technician time for daily work. Technicians can not only easily pick, change, or complete work order details, but also add notes with multiple inline images. 

In addition, to help improve first-time fix rates, **Dynamics 365 Guides in 2D mode** can now be embedded for step-by-step instructions with pictures and branching flow.

## Public Preview features limitations
The public preview features currently have the following limitations:
- Offline is not supported. In order to properly experience the new Public Preview features, please disable the offline profile.
- Customizations are not supported. All customizations are currenlty not supported and will not work in Public Preview.
- Language. The new Public Preview features respect the mobile device language settings, while the current app respects the language settings in the user profile. This might cause a mixed language experience if the two settings are out of sync.

# Microsoft 365 integrations for Field Service (Preview)

[!INCLUDE[public-preview-banner](../includes/public-preview-banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 Field Service integrates with Microsoft Outlook, Teams, and Viva Connections so that frontline workers and managers can create, view, and manage work orders within Outlook and Teams. A frontline manager is typically a service manager and dispatcher. A frontline worker is a technician, the one performing the repair or maintenance.

An Outlook add-in allows frontline managers to view and create work orders in Outlook, so they can quickly respond to service requests and questions. The Outlook add-in also provides copilot capabilities to assist with work order creation and scheduling in Outlook.

A Viva Connections dashboard in Teams provides frontline workers with an at-a-glance view of their workday and frontline managers with the ability to view and create work orders. Users can also initiate a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call from here.

As an organization, you can use the capabilities in Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Teams or both. For more information about what the integrations provide, see:

- [Field Service (Preview) Outlook Add-in with Copilot for the Frontline Manager](flw-outlook.md)
- [Field Service (Preview) Teams overview for the Frontline Manager](flw-teams-manager.md)
- [Field Service (Preview) Teams overview for the Frontline Worker](flw-teams-worker.md)

Administrators enable these preview features for end users in their organization. See [Microsoft 365 integrations for Field Service for Administrators (preview)](flw-admin.md).

Dynamics 365 Field Service (Preview) allows administrators and users to access content and share data outside of Microsoft 365 once consent is given to link their Microsoft work or school account with their Dynamics 365 account.

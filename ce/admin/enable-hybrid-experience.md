# Enable the hybrid experience

Most of the core functionalities of sales and customer service have moved to the [Unified Interface](about-unified-interface.md) experience. Some of the features that are not yet on Unified Interface can now be accessed in the Unified Interface client. 

The following features are not yet present in the Unified Interface but can be enabled in the Unified Interface through the hybrid experience.

- [Advanced Find](../basics/save-advanced-find-search.md) 
- [Bulk edit](manage-your-data.md)
- [Merge records](../basics/merge-duplicate-records-accounts-contacts-leads.md)
- [Record sharing](../basics/assign-record-user-team.md)
- All options under **Set Personal Options** (![Settings gear](../basics/media/settings-gear-icon.png "Settings gear"))

These features are enabled through a setting in System Settings.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings**.  
2. Select the **General** tab.

When you enable the hybrid experience, commands appear on the command bar. For example, when you select an account, **Edit**, **Merge**, and **Share** commands are available.

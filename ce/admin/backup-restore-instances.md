# Backup and restore instances

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Protecting your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data and providing continuous availability of service is important for you and for us. You have multiple options for backing up and restoring your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instances.   
  
<a name="BKMK_DailySystemBackup"></a>  
 
## Daily system backups  
 Good news! Some backups take place without you having to do anything.  
  
 About [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] **system backups**:  
  
-   All your instances are backed up.  
  
-   System backups occur daily.  
  
-   System backups are retained up to three days. Check your expiration date.  
  
  ![](media/Expires66.png "Expires On column that shows the expiration dates for backups.")
  
-   System backups do not count against your storage limits.  
  
-   System backups are identified as created by **System** on the **Manage backups** page.  
  
 ![Backup & Restore tab in the Dynamics 365 Administration Center](../admin/media/backup-and-restore-tab.png "Backup & Restore tab in the Dynamics 365 Administration Center")  
  
### See your system backups  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_office365_signin](../includes/proc-office365-signin.md)] You can also sign in with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] System Administrator or Delegated Admin security roles.  
  
2.  Click **Admin centers** > **Dynamics 365**.  
  
3.  Click the **Backup & Restore** tab.  
  
4.  Choose an instance from the **Backups for** drop-down list.  
  
 System-created backups appear under **Created By** as **System**.

## On-demand backup: Dynamics 365 managed  
 Automated system backups are great, but you will want to be able to make your own backups before making some significant customization change or applying a version update. You can do this with on-demand [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] managed  backups.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  A backup is created for you when we update your instance.  
  
 About [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] managed **on-demand backups**:  
  
-   You can back up Production and Sandbox instances.  
  
- **You can only restore to a Sandbox instance**. To restore to a Production instance, first switch it to a Sandbox instance. See [Switch an instance](../admin/switch-instance.md).  
  
-   Only [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online-subsequent.md)] or later versions are supported for backup.  
  
-   On-demand backups are retained for up to three days. Check your expiration date.  
  
 ![On-demand backup expiration date](../admin/media/on-demand-backup-expiration-date.png "On-demand backup expiration date")  
  
-   On-demand backups are identified by having a label you created and by the presence of **Edit** &#124; **Delete** &#124; **Restore** in the details section. System backups have only **Restore**.

## On-demand backup: Azure managed  
 Using [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] to store and manage your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] backup provides some benefits you should consider.  
  
 About [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] managed on demand backups:  
  
-   You must have an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] account to use [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] storage.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  If you don't have an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] storage account and need to create one, see [About Azure storage accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-create-storage-account).  
  
-   You can create multiple [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] backups for each instance.  
  
-   You can back up Production and Sandbox instances.  
  
- **You can only restore to a Sandbox instance**. To restore to a Production instance, first switch it to a Sandbox instance. See [Switch an instance](../admin/switch-instance.md).  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] backups do not count against your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] storage limit.  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] backups are retained until you delete them.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  We support restoring [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] backups that are supported online and not more than three years old.  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] backups are identified as **Azure Storage** in the details section.

5.  If you've already configured Azure storage, you can skip to step 9.  
  
6.  Click **Configure Azure Storage**.  
  
 ![Click Configure Azure storage](../admin/media/click-configure-azure-storage.png "Click Configure Azure storage")  
  
7.  Enter the following settings from your [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] storage account.  
  
    |Settings|Example|  
    |--------------|-------------|

### Get the information you need from your Azure storage account  
 To use [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] storage for your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance backups, you need to set up a connection between [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Here's how you get the settings from [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] to make the connection. You'll enter these settings in the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)] when you configure [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] storage.  
  
1.  Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).  
  
2.  Click **More services** > **Storage accounts**, and choose your storage account. Make note of the storage account name. This is used for the first field in **Configure Azure storage**.  
  
 ![Note the Azure storage account name.](../admin/media/azure-storage-account-name-dialog.png "Note the Azure storage account name.")  
  
3.  Click Access keys, and then for **key 2** click **Copy**. Paste this into the second field in **Configure Azure storage**.  
  
 ![Copy the Azure storage access key.](../admin/media/azure-storage-access-key.png "Copy the Azure storage access key.")  
  
4.  Scroll down and click **Containers**. Make note of the storage container name. This is used for the third field in **Configure Azure storage**.  
  
 ![Note the Azure storage container name.](../admin/media/azure-storage-container-name.png "Note the Azure storage container name.")  
  
<a name="BKMK_EditRestoreDeleteAzurebackup"></a>   

### Edit, Restore, or Delete an Azure on-demand backup  
 The process for editing, restoring, or deleting an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] on-demand backup is mostly the same process as  for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] on-demand backup.  See the related [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] sections above.  
  
 Note the following:  
  
-   When you delete an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] on-demand backup, the backup is not removed from [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] storage. Use the [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_shortest](../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] portal to remove the backup.

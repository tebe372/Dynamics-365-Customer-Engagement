# Manage storage 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Capacity reports are now available. See [Common Data Service storage capacity](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/capacity-storage). The content below applies to customers with capacity reports not yet available.

You can manage your organization’s data storage capacity in connection with your subscription to [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] apps. The type of subscription you purchase determines the amount of storage initially allocated to your organization. If you run out of storage, you can add more.  
  
 You can also gain storage by deleting certain types of unnecessary data in Customer Engagement apps. For information on deleting data, see: [Free storage space in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement](free-storage-space.md).  
  
 For information on storage amounts included with the various [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] apps plans, see: [Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/pricing).  
  
## Monitor the amount of storage your organization is using  

You now monitor storage usage in the [Power Platform Admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/capacity-storage).
   
## Add storage to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps (online)  
 
As a global or billing administrator, you can purchase additional storage for your company on Microsoft 365 admin center by following the steps below. [Learn how to find your global or billing administrator](../basics/find-administrator-support.md). 

If you purchase through volume licensing or a cloud solutions provider, please contact your partner directly.  
 
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_office365_signin](../includes/proc-office365-signin.md)]  
  
2. Click **Billing** > **Purchase Services**.  
  
3. Scroll down to the **Add-on subscriptions** section and mouse over the **Dynamics 365 - Additional Database Storage** tile.  
  
   ![Purchase additional online storage](../admin/media/purchase-additional-online-storage.png "Purchase additional online storage")  
  
4. Click **Buy now**, and then proceed through the order process.  
  
     If you paid for the subscription by credit card, any additional storage space that you order will be available immediately after you receive an order confirmation. If you’re invoiced for subscription payments, you may be asked to complete a credit check. In this case, the additional storage will not be available until the credit check is passed.  

## What happens if you exceed your storage limit?

[!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps System administrators will receive frequent email notifications which will cease once additional storage is added or storage is reduced to below the limit.

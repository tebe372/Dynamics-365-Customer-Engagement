# Preview feature: Use Azure text analytics to suggest service solutions
You want your customer service reps to resolve cases quickly and with high customer satisfaction. Using the [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] text analytics service with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you can set up a text analytics connection to automatically provide your support staff with more relevant solutions from knowledge articles, system-suggested similar cases, and system-generated topic analysis. Similarly, relevant documents can be automatically surfaced to your sales staff as they work in certain records, such as a big opportunity, by using Document Suggestions.

# Common Data Service instances

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

The Common Data Service allows you to securely store and manage data used in your [!INCLUDE [pn-powerapps](../includes/pn-powerapps.md)] [environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/administrator/environments-overview). As of March 21, 2018, [!INCLUDE [pn-powerapps](../includes/pn-powerapps.md)] environments provisioned with a Common Data Service database are displayed as instances in the [!INCLUDE [pn-dyn-365-admin-center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)]. There you can view and do some management of your Common Data Service instances.

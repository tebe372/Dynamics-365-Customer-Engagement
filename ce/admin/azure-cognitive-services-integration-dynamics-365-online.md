# Preview feature: Use Azure Cognitive Services integration to add intelligent recommendations
Imagine being able to make product recommendations to your customers as they are selecting items for purchase. When you connect [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Azure_Recommendations_API](../includes/pn-azure-recommendations-api.md)] using Azure Cognitive Services, this becomes possible. You can use the Recommendations API to build an advanced machine learning model for automatic cross-sell product recommendations based on historical transaction data. Once you add the product recommendations capability in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] by using the Recommendations API, a native capability is added to the product catalog to generate automatic recommendations by configuring connectivity to the service. In addition,  you set up the product catalog and  synchronization to build a machine-learning-based recommendation model. You will then use this model to make recommendations in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] transactions, such as opportunity, quote, or order level, to suggest additional cross-sell products and help improve the total value of the deal. To learn about using Recommendation API in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], see:   [Preview feature: Create and manage models to make product recommendations](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt703320.aspx)  
  
 You want your customer service reps to resolve cases quickly and with high customer satisfaction. Using the [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_machine_learning](../includes/pn-azure-machine-learning.md)] Text Analytics service with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], you can set up service case analysis to automatically provide your support staff with more relevant solutions from the knowledge base. They spend less time searching for answers and more time providing the right response. To learn about using the [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_machine_learning](../includes/pn-azure-machine-learning.md)] Text Analytics service in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], see: [Set the text analytics connection](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt703318.aspx)

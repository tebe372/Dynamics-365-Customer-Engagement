# Enable and use retrieve multiple auditing

Protecting data, preserving privacy, and complying with regulations such as the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Privacy/gdpr/default.aspx) are certainly some of the highest priorities for your business. It's critical that you audit the entirety of data processing actions taking place to be able to analyze for possible security breaches.  

A user can have many interactions with various Office and Dynamics applications. You need to capture all these actions to sort through and find the relevant data.

This topic covers how you can set [!INCLUDE [pn-ms-dyn-365](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365.md)] to audit a broad range of data processing activities and use the [Office 365 Security and Compliance Center](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/go-to-the-office-365-security-compliance-center-7e696a40-b86b-4a20-afcc-559218b7b1b8?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) to review the data in activity reports.

## How this differs from past audit logging
Audit logging as described in [Audit data and user activity for security and compliance](audit-data-user-activity.md) covers enabling and viewing logging for specific entities and attributes which you select. What is logged is largely based on the context of the activity. Open a record and activities such as who created the record, what values were entered and changed, who updated it, etc, are logged for that particular record.

The content below describes a process to enable logging and reviewing multiple activities across multiple apps- a much broader audit.

After configuring auditing as described below, when a user opens a view in Dynamics 365, all the records in that view are logged as seen by the user not just the record they opened. In addition, activities in other Office products such as Exchange or Excel are logged to give a broad picture of user actions.


## Scenarios to features

Consider the following scenarios an admin will likely encounter and the features needed to address them.

|Scenario |  |Feature  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Must be able to:<br /><ul><li>Record and analyze unauthorized data access</li><br /><li>Record and analyze alteration of data</li><br /><li>Record and analyze accidental or unlawful destruction of data</li>     |         |Must be able to:<br /><br /><li>Clearly identify all the creates and read actions done by the user</li><br /><li>Clearly identify all the update actions done by the user</li><br /><li>Clearly identify any accidental delete action done by the admin</li><br /><li>Clearly identify the request origin</li></ul>Â |

We'll show you how to set up the features needed to capture and review the data in these scenarios.

## What events are audited
The following are the admin and user events you can audit.

### Admin-related events

|Event  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Publishing customizations  |An admin publishes a new customization which overrides a change done by the previous one. The action requires auditing for analysis.    |
|Attribute deletes     |Admin accidentally deletes an attribute. This action also deletes the data. |
|Team, user management     |Who was added, who was deleted, what access rights a user/team had is important for analyzing impact.|
|Configure instance     |Adding solutions to an instance.|
|Backup and restore     |Backup and restore actions at the tenant.|
|Manage applications     |New instance added, existing instance deleted, trials converted to paid, etc.|

### User and support-related events 

|Event  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Create, read, update, delete (CRUD)     |Logging all CRUD activities essential for understanding the impact of a problem and being compliant with data protection impact assessments (DPIA). |
|Multiple record view     |Users of Dynamics view information in bulk, like grid views, reports etc. Critical customer content information is part of these views.|
|Export to Excel     |Exporting data to Excel moves the data outside of the secure environment and is vulnerable to threats.|
|SDK calls via surround or custom apps     |Actions taken via the core platform or surround apps calling into the SDK to perform an action needs to be logged.|
|All support CRUD activities     |Microsoft support engineer activities on customer environment.|
|Admin activities     |Admin activities on customer tenant.|
|Backend commands     |Microsoft support engineer activities on customer tenant and environment.|

## Enable auditing in Dynamics 365
<slide 17-18, req 5-9>
1. In Dynamics 365 (online), choose Settings > Administration > System Settings > Auditing tab.
2. Under **Audit Settings**, enable the following check boxes:
   - **Start Auditing**
   - **Audit user access**
   - **Start Read Auditing** (Note: this only appears if you enable **Start Auditing**.)
3. Under **Enable Auditing in the following areas**, enable the check boxes for the areas you want to audit and then choose **OK**.
   ![System Settings Auditing](media/system-settings-auditing.png "System Settings Auditing")
4. Go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**
5. Under **Components**, expand **Entities** and select an entity to audit, such as **Account**.
6. Scroll down and under **Data Services** enable **Auditing**.
7. Under **Auditing**, enable the following check boxes:
   - **Retrieve Record Auditing**
   - **Retrieve Multiple Auditing**
8. Choose **Save**.
9. Choose **Publish** to publish the customization.
10. Repeat steps 5 - 9 for other entities you want to audit.
   ![Retrieve Auditing](media/retrieve-auditing.png "Retrieve Auditing")

Next, you need to make sure audit logging is turned on in Office 365. See [Turn Office 365 audit log search on or off](https://support.office.com/article/turn-office-365-audit-log-search-on-or-off-e893b19a-660c-41f2-9074-d3631c95a014).

## Review your audit data using reports in Office 365 Security and Compliance Center
<req 56>
You can review your audit data in the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center. See [Search the audit log for user and admin activity in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/search-the-audit-log-for-user-and-admin-activity-in-office-365-57ca5138-0ae0-4d34-bd40-240441ef2fb6).

To use the preconfigured Dynamics 365 reports, go to https://protection.office.com > **Search & investigation** > **Audit log search** and select the **Dynamics 365 activities** tab.

![Dynamics 365 audit log reports](media/D365-audit-log-reports.png "Dynamics 365 audit log reports")

The following are the Dynamics 365 preconfigured reports:

|  |  |   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Accessed out-of-box entity     |Accessed custom entity |Accessed admin entity  |
|Performed bulk actions (such as delete and import)  |Accessed other entity type   |Accessed Dynamics 365 admin center  |
|Accessed internal management tool |Signed in or out  |Activated process or plug-in  |

## Create reports
You can create your own reports to review your audit data. See [Search the audit log in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://support.office.com/article/search-the-audit-log-in-the-office-365-security-compliance-center-0d4d0f35-390b-4518-800e-0c7ec95e946c).

## Additional considerations

- When audit log search in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center is turned on, user and admin activity from your organization is recorded in the audit log and retained for 90 days. However, your organization might not want to record and retain audit log data. Or you might be using a third-party security information and event management (SIEM) application to access your auditing data. In those cases, a global admin can turn off audit log search in Office 365.

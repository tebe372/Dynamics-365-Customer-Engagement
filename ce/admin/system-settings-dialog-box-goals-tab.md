# System Settings dialog box - Goals tab

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

Set the duration and frequency of the automatic rollup of goals. These settings only affect the automatic handling of all goals set in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. You can always perform a manual rollup for any goal at any time.

   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. If you are using a Sales web application, go to **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings**, and then select the **Goals** tab.

   OR

   If you are using the Sales Hub App, select the Site map icon ![Site map icon](../sales-enterprise/media/site-map-icon.png "Site map icon"), then select ellipsis ![Ellipsis to open more options](../sales-enterprise/media/ellipsis-more-options.png "Ellipsis to open more options") , then select **App Settings**, and then select **Goals Settings**.

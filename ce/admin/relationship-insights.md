# Preview feature: Relationship Insights

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Relationship Insights is a suite of features which continuously analyze the vast collection of customer-interaction data already stored in your [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)] databases, to help you better understand your business relationships, evaluate your activities in relation to previous successes, and choose the best path forward.  
  
Relationship Insights includes the following features, which all work together to amplify their individual strengths:  
  
-   Relationship assistant  
  
-   Email engagement  
  
-   Auto capture  
  
All of these features are available as preview features in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-online.md)] and are only available in North American sites that use US English (en-us). Some basic features of the relationship assistant are also available in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_op](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-op.md)]. Additional restrictions apply depending on which versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)] you are running. For complete details about how to enable these preview features, plus version requirements, prerequisites, and any known issues, see [Preview feature: Configure Relationship Insights features](../admin/configure-relationship-insights-features.md).  
  
A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.  
  
When fully included in the product, Relationship Insights will help salespeople work more effectively while nurturing and enhancing their business relationships.

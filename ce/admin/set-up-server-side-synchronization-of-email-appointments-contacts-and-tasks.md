# Set up server-side synchronization of email, appointments, contacts, and tasks
You can use [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)] to synchronize your email system with [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] at the server level. For example, you can synchronize [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange-online.md)] (hosted email server) or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_full](../includes/pn-exchange-server-full.md)] (on-premises). If you synchronize [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-exchange-online.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Server_short](../includes/pn-exchange-server-short.md)], in addition to [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email, you can synchronize [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] appointments, contacts, and tasks.  
  
 You can also use [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)] to synchronize [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] with a [!INCLUDE[pn_POP3_short](../includes/pn-pop3-short.md)] email server for web-hosted email like Gmail or [!INCLUDE[pn_outlook_com](../includes/pn-outlook-com.md)]. If you synchronize email with a [!INCLUDE[pn_POP3_short](../includes/pn-pop3-short.md)] email server, you canâ€™t synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks, however.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Using encryption software (such as Vaultive) together with [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)] is not supported.

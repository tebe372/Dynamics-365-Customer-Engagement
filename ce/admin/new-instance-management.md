# Manage instances 

[!INCLUDE[applies-to](../includes/cc_applies_to_ce.md)]

We are transitioning management of instances (now called environments) to the [Power Platform Admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com). For more information, see [Environments overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/environments-overview).

# Administer customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365

Effective October 2019, the *Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement* SKU/license plan is no longer available for online customers. More information: [Dynamics 365 Licensing Update](/dynamics365/licensing/update)

With this change for online customers, we are no longer using the term "Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps" to refer to the following collection of Dynamics 365 apps and their related services:
- Dynamics 365 Sales
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service
- Dynamics 365 Marketing 
- Dynamics 365 Field Service
- Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation


For online customers, these Dynamics 365 apps (collectively referred to as customer engagement apps) run on [Microsoft Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro) and use Power Apps model-driven app design. More information: [What are model-driven apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview)

Administration for customer engagement apps has transitioned to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com). More information: [Administer Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation).

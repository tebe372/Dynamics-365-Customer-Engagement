# Administer model-driven apps in Dynamics 365

Effective October 2019, the *Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement* SKU/license plan is no longer available for online customers. More information: [Dynamics 365 Licensing Update](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/licensing/update)

With this change for online customers, we are no longer using the term "Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps" to refer to the following collection of Dynamics 365 apps and their related services:
- Dynamics 365 Sales
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service
- Dynamics 365 Marketing 
- Dynamics 365 Field Service
- Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation

For online customers, these apps are **model-driven apps** running on [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro). You can build model-driven apps using Power Apps. More information: [What are model-driven apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The content in this guide is for existing subscribers still using the Dynamics 365 admin center, which was used to manage Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement instances. We are transitioning instance (now called environment) management to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com). For the latest documentation, see the [Power Platform admin guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation).
>
> The content in this guide applies only to model-driven apps in Dynamics 365; it does not apply to other Dynamics 365 apps such as Finance, Supply Chain Management, Business Central, and so on.

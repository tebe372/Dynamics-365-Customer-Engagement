# What are Preview features and how do I enable them? 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Preview features are features that aren’t complete, but are made available on a “preview” basis so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features:  
  
- Are subject to separate [Supplemental Terms of Use](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511446).  
  
- **Are not supported by [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Support](../includes/pn-microsoft-support.md)]**.  
  
- May have limited or restricted functionality.  
  
- Aren’t meant for production use.  
  
- May be available only in selected geographic areas.  
  
## What preview features were included in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online-subsequent.md)]?  

 The following table lists the features that are still in preview, as well as  learning resources for each.

2. Choose **System Settings**, and then click the **Previews** tab.  
  
3. Read the [license terms](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511446), and if you agree, select the **I’ve read and agree to the license terms** check box.

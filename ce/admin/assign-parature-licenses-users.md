# Assign Parature licenses to Dynamics 365 users
Any [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] user with a Professional user subscription license can use the knowledge management capability in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] without any additional setup in [!INCLUDE[pn_parature_from_microsoft](../includes/pn-parature-from-microsoft.md)].  
  
 If a [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] user with an Enterprise user subscription license wants to use knowledge management capability, you’ll need to assign a [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../includes/pn-parature.md)] license to the user, and then assign this user a “Knowledgebase View Only” role in [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../includes/pn-parature.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The instructions in this topic are applicable to you only if your organization is using the [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../includes/pn-parature.md)] knowledgebase.  
  
 To assign and verify [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../includes/pn-parature.md)] licenses, use the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services_Portal](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-portal.md)].  
  
1.  Browse to the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services_Portal](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-portal.md)] ([https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com)) and sign in using Global administrator credentials.  
  
2.  Click **Users** > **Active Users** and select a user to assign a license.

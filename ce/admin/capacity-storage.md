# Preview: Common Data Service for Apps storage capacity

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> For introductory information on the new capacity analytics model, see [need link].

Data volume continues to grow exponentially, as businesses advance their digital transformation journey and bring data across their organization together. Modern business applications need to support new business scenarios, manage new data types, and help organizations with the increasing complexity of compliance mandates. To support the growing needs of todayâ€™s organizations, data storage solutions need to evolve continuously and provide the right solution to support expanding business needs.

We have updated our capacity analytics reporting to provide important benefits to our customers. Here is a summary of changes in capacity analytics.

- New **Capacity** page is available in the Power the Platform Admin center.
-	Admins can visualize the data stored in Database, Files, and Logs. 
-	Entitlement information is added to the report to help customers understand available capacity of the tenant level.
-	Existing customers get entitlements for new types of capacity (File and Log) but are not impacted by the licensing change until renewal.

The new capacity analytics reporting provides a single place to view your capacity data.

## About the new capacity analytics reporting

We're optimizing data management for database storage, attachments, and audit Logs. There are now three types of storage: Database, File, and Log.

## FAQ

### I am an existing customer, will I be immediately impacted by this change?
No, there is no immediate change for existing customers as your current term will be honored for the duration of your agreement. 

### I'm an existing customer with an EA agreement. Should I go buy Log and File capacity?
If you have an existing agreement, you are not impacted with the current change. We have added Log and File capacity to your current entitlement which reduces your Database capacity. Until renewal, you can continue with the current plan.

### I'm an existing customer and my renewal is coming up. Will I be impacted?
Customers who renew existing subscriptions can choose to continue to transact using the existing offers for a certain period of time. Please contact your Microsoft partner or Microsoft sales team for details.

### Will the Storage tab in Common Data Service continue to work?
The **Storage** tab will be deprecated as we move to the new updated Capacity Analytics.

### I have a PowerApps environment with Database, will this environment count against capacity?
Yes. All Common Data Service for Apps environments are counted.

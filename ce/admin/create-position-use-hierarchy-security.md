# Create a position to use in hierarchy security to manage access
Reduce the complexity of managing security roles by creating a position hierarchy. Then define jobs or positions in your company and assign them to different places in your position hierarchy. Higher level positions in the hierarchy have Read, Write, Update, Append, and AppendTo access to their direct reportsâ€™ records. They also have Read-only access to the records of non-direct reports in their hierarchy.

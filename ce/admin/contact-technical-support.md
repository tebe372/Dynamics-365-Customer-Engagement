## Preview feature: new Dynamics 365 support center 

On February 14, 2018, we introduced a new Help + support experience for admins to contact a Microsoft support representative for Dynamics 365 (online). The new process will help us improve your overall support experience and drive faster issue resolution. 

### Prerequisites

-  This is a Preview feature that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback.

-  Currently provided in English. We’re working to provide other languages soon.

   - Global

   - Subscription Support
   - Enhanced Support
   - Professional Direct Support

   Premier Support plan members can go to [My Premier Online](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/premier). </br>
   Microsoft Partners or delegated admins can go to [Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/en-us/partner/home).

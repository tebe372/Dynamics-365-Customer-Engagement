# Learn more about changing the computer that synchronizes your Outlook records
You’re seeing the following dialog box because you have Dynamics 365 for Outlook installed on more than one computer, and you need to decide which computer to use to synchronize your appointments, contacts, and tasks with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
 ![Screen shot of Outlook sync Yes&#47;No dialog box](../admin/media/cc-outlook-sync-yes-no-dialog-box-cc-outlook-sync-yes-no-dialog-box.png "Screen shot of Outlook sync Yes/No dialog box")  
  
 You’re currently using another computer to do the synchronization tasks. For example, you may be working on a desktop computer, and your other computer is a laptop, or vice versa.  
  
 You can track and update email, appointments, contacts, and tasks from any computer running [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], but you can only use one computer to synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks.  
  
 **Should I choose Yes or No in the dialog box?**  
  
-   Choose **Yes** if you want to make this computer the synchronizing computer. You will still be able to track [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] appointments, contacts, and tasks on the other computer, but you won’t be able to synchronize records with that computer.  
  
-   Choose **No** to keep the other computer as the synchronizing computer.

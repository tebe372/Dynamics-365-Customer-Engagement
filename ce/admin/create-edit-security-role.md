# Create or edit a security role to manage access
You can create new security roles to accommodate changes in your business requirements or you can edit the privileges associated with an existing security role.  
  
 If you need to back up your security role changes, or export security roles for use in a different implementation of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], you can export them as part of exporting customizations. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Export your customizations as a solution](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=513279)  
  
## Create a security role  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
    - [!INCLUDE[proc_check_your_security_role](../includes/proc-check-your-security-role.md)]  
  
    - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
3.  Click **Security Roles**.  
  
4.  On the Actions toolbar, click **New**.  
  
5.  Set the privileges on each tab.  
  
     To change the access level for a privilege, click the symbol until you see the symbol you want. The possible access levels depend on whether the record type is organization-owned or user-owned.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  To cycle through the access levels, you can also click the privilege column heading, or click the record type multiple times.  
  
6.  When you have finished configuring the security role, on the toolbar, click or tap **Save and Close**.  
  
## Edit a security role  
 Before you edit an existing security role, make sure that you understand the principles of data access. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Controlling Data Access](../admin/security-roles-privileges.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You canâ€™t edit the System Administrator security role. To create a security role similar to the System Administrator security role, copy the System Administrator security role, and make changes to the new role.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
    - [!INCLUDE[proc_check_your_security_role](../includes/proc-check-your-security-role.md)]  
  
    - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
3.  Click **Security Roles**.  
  
4.  In the list of security roles, double-click or tap a name to open the page associated with that security role.  
  
5.  Set the privileges on each tab.  
  
     To change the access level for a privilege, click the symbol until you see the symbol you want. The possible access levels depend on whether the record type is organization-owned or user-owned.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  To cycle through the access levels, you can also click the privilege column heading, or click the record type multiple times.  
  
6.  When you have finished configuring the security role, on the toolbar, click or tap **Save and Close**.  
  
## Minimum privileges for common tasks  
 It's helpful to keep in mind the minimum privileges that are needed for some common tasks. These include:

    -   To render the home page, assign the following privileges on the Customization tab: Read Web Resource, Read Customizations  
  
    -   To render an entity grid (that is, to view lists of records and other data): Read privilege on the entity, Read User Settings on the Business Management tab, and Read View on the Customization tab  
  
    -   To view single entities in detail: Read privilege on the entity, Read System Form on the Customization tab, Create and Read User Entity UI Settings on the Core Records tab  
  
-   When logging in to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]:  
  
    -   To render navigation for [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and all [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] buttons: Read Entity and Read View on the Customizations tab  
  
    -   To render an entity grid: Read privilege on the entity, Read Customizations and Read Web Resource on the Customization tab,  and Read Saved View on the Core Records tab  
  
    -   To render entities: Read privilege on the entity, Read System Form on the Customization tab, and Create, Read, and Write User Entity UI Settings on the Core Records tab

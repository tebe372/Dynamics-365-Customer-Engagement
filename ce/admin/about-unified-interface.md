# About Unified Interface

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

With the release of [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-9-0-0-online](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)], we've introduced a new user experience - Unified Interface - which uses responsive web design principles to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience for any screen size, device, or orientation. 

The new Unified Interface brings all the rich experiences to any client that you are using. Whether you are on a browser, tablet, or phone, you will be able to consume similar experiences. Some examples: 

> - Similar form experiences to update and view your records
> - Interactive dashboards across all devices to view your information and drill into it 
> - Reference Panel is now available to be used in any experience and not just cases 
> - We now support right to left (RTL) languages
> - All experiences on Unified Interface is completely accessible 

## Capabilities available on Unified Interface Runtime with Dynamics 365 9.0 

Moving users to Unified Interface will depend on the functions you do in your day to day life. You will need to evaluate the jobs done by your users and can move their experience to unified interface client that will provide a richer user experience. 

Most of the core functionalities of sales and customer service have moved to the unified interface client. 

### Dashboards and Charts

### Enhanced User Experience

If your users work on core record types like Activities, Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Opportunities and Cases, you will be able to move them to unified interface client. 

They will have familiar capabilities on unified interface and will also discover productivity enhancements with the introduction of some enhanced capabilities. 

#### Timeline control 
The timeline view helps you collaborate with your team by tracking customer communication in a record on a single page in an easy to read view. You can see everything from posts and voice attachments, to emails and notes. It provides a quick way to see the entire communication thread. 

#### Business Process Enhancement 
The business process flow has been improved by the docking mechanism. You can dock the business process stage on your screen to help you stay focused on the task at hand in your business process flow. This is especially useful when the stage of the process has complex steps to complete. 

#### Reference Panel 
Use the reference panel for apps built on unified interface like Dynamics 365 for Customer Service. The reference panel is a great way to get work done without clicking away from the screen you are on. You can look up other things like knowledge base articles within the context of the record you are viewing. 

#### Navigation
The new menu options let you swiftly navigate the different apps in the system. It provides quick access to recently viewed records and pinned favorites. 

#### Reflow 
The app also scales by reflowing the components on the screen. The responsive design adapts to your environment based on screen size, so the more available space that you have the more information can be displayed.

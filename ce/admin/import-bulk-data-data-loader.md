# Preview feature: Import bulk data with the Data Loader 
  
## Overview
 If you need to import bulk data, you donâ€™t have to write custom code or use third-party tools. Use the new [!INCLUDE[cc_data_loader_service](../includes/cc-data-loader-service.md)] for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)]. With this service, you can move your data between flat files and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] and cut down on implementation costs.  
  
 Currently, the preview supports importing data only.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The [!INCLUDE[cc_data_loader_service](../includes/cc-data-loader-service.md)] is a preview feature in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update.md)]. [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)][!INCLUDE[cc_preview_feature](../includes/cc-preview-feature.md)][!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_no_MS_support](../includes/cc-preview-features-no-ms-support.md)]  
>   
> **The [!INCLUDE[cc_data_loader_service](../includes/cc-data-loader-service.md)] is available as a preview only for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] organizations in North America**.

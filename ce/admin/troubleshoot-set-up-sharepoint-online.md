    2. Donâ€™t have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.

   1. Identity the entity for which the documents link should be visible (e.g. account, contact, opportunity...etc.).

   3. Make sure the entity you wished to have documents link (selected in Step 1) are selected and a valid SharePoint URL is specified. 
   4. Complete the wizard.
   5. Verify if the Documents link /button is appearing.

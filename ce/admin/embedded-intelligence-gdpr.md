# Embedded Intelligence and GDPR

Applies to Dynamics 365 (online), version 9.0.2

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is a European Union (EU) directive that is fundamentally about protecting and enabling the privacy rights of individuals. The GDPR establishes strict privacy requirements governing how you manage and protect personal data while respecting individual choiceâ€”no matter where data is sent, processed, or stored.

The Embedded Intelligence feature is prepared to help organizations work in compliance with the GDPR when using the system, but some development work, consultancy assistance, or both, is still necessary. As part of a comprehensive, organization-wide effort, most organizations need to review and update all their information systems to come into complete compliance.

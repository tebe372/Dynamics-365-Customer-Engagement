# Preview feature: Set up Cortana integration

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After carefully consideration, we've decided to discontinue the [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] integration preview feature. Dynamics 365 will no longer appear in Cortana’s notebook, and Cortana will no longer prompt users with relevant information about sales activities, accounts, opportunities, and meetings. We welcome your [feedback and ideas](https://ideas.dynamics.com/ideas/dynamics-crm).
  
<!-- 

We’re introducing [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] integration to help salespeople keep track of important [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] activities. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)] embeds sales activities, accounts, and opportunities into [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] to surface what’s most relevant to salespeople at any time.  
  
 Cortana integration is available as a Preview feature to organizations that use [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)]. [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_expect_changes](../includes/cc-preview-features-expect-changes.md)]  
  
 [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_no_MS_support](../includes/cc-preview-features-no-ms-support.md)]  
  
 Eventually, Cortana integration will be fully included in the product.

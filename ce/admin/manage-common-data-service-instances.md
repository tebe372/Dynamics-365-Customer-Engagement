# Manage Common Data Service instances

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

The Common Data Service allows you to securely store and manage data used in your PowerApps [environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/administrator/environments-overview). As of March 21, 2018, PowerApps environments are displayed as instances in the Dynamics 365 admin center. There you can now view and do some management of your Common Data Service instances.

## Indentify Common Data Service instances

1. In the Dynamics 365 admin center, select the **Instances** tab.
2. Select an instance and look for **Common Data Service** in the description details. 

## Manage Common Data Service instances

Currently, Common Data Service instances are available as trial and production types. You can do some management in the Dynamics 365 admin center such as [editing](edit-properties-instance.md), [copying](copy-instance.md), and [deleting](delete-instance.md).  

For complete management of Common Data Service instances such as managing users, permissions, and environment roles, use the [PowerApps Admin Center](https://admin.powerapps.com).

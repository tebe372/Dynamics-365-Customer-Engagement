# Preview feature: Product recommendations
Imagine being able to make product recommendations to your customers as they are selecting items for purchase. When you connect [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] recommendation service, this becomes possible. You can use the [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] recommendation service to build an advanced machine learning model for automatic cross-sell product recommendations based on historical transaction data. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create and manage models to make product recommendations](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/56b35229-72f8-46ca-bebf-eae023f633c2.aspx)

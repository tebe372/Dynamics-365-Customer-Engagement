# Enable or disable hierarchy security to control access
Reduce the time you spend maintaining security roles for users by using hierarchy security. With hierarchy security, you can give upper-level users, such as managers or vice presidents, certain levels of access to their direct reports’ records and lesser levels of access to their non-direct reports’ records. Find out more about hierarchy security and how to set it up on TechNet.

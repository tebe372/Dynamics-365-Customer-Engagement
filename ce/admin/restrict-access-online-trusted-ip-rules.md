# Restrict access with trusted IP rules

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can limit access to Customer Engagement apps to users with   trusted IP addresses to reduce unauthorized access. When trusted IP address restrictions are set in a userâ€™s profile and the user tries to log in from an untrusted IP address, access to Customer Engagement apps is blocked.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
- A subscription to [Azure Active Directory Premium](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/azure-active-directory).  
  
- A federated [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] tenant. See [Azure AD conditional access and federated authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview#azure-ad-conditional-access-and-federated-authentication).
  
- Federated tenants require that multi-factor authentication (MFA) be enabled.

## Additional security considerations  
 IP restriction is only enforced during user authentication.  This is done by the [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] Conditional Access capability. Customer Engagement apps sets a session timeout limit to balance protecting user data and the number of times users are prompted for their sign-in credentials. Trusted IP restriction for devices (including laptops) is not applied until the Customer Engagement apps session timeout expires.  
  
 For example, a trusted IP restriction is setup to only allow access to [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps when users are working from a corporate office.  When a [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps user signs in into [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps using their laptop from their office and establishes a [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps session, the user can continue to access [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps after leaving the office until the [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps session timeout expires.  This behavior also applies to mobile and offsite connections such as: Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps for phones and tablets, and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)].

## Create a security group (optional)  
You can restrict access to all Users or groups of users.  It's more efficient to restrict by a group if only a subset of your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users are accessing Customer Engagement apps.  

For information, see: [Create a basic group and add members using Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal).
  
<a name="BKMK_CreateTrustedIPRule"></a>   

## Create a location based restriction
Access restriction is set using Azure Active Directory (AD) Conditional Access and the Trusted IPs feature of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication. 

See:
- [Getting started with conditional access to Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-conditional-access-azuread-connected-apps/)
- [Trusted IPs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings#trusted-ips)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Setting Conditional Access is only available with an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] Premium license.  Upgrade your Azure AD to a Premium license in the Microsoft 365 admin center (**<https://admin.microsoft.com>** > **Billing** > **Purchase services**).

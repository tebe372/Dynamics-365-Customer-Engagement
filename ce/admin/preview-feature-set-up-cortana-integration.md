# Preview feature: Set up Cortana integration
We’re introducing [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] integration to help salespeople keep track of important [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] activities. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)] embeds sales activities, accounts, and opportunities into [!INCLUDE[pn_cortana](../includes/pn-cortana.md)] to surface what’s most relevant to salespeople at any time.  
  
 Cortana integration is available as a Preview feature to organizations that use [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update-shortest.md)]. [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_expect_changes](../includes/cc-preview-features-expect-changes.md)]  
  
 [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_no_MS_support](../includes/cc-preview-features-no-ms-support.md)]  
  
 Eventually, Cortana integration will be fully included in the product.

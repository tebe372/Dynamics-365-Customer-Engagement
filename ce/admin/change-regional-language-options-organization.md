# Change regional and language options for your organization
You can change how [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] displays dates, times, numbers, and currencies. You can also select the language in which [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] displays the user interface and Help.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you’re running [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], you must download one or more [Language Packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=513276) before you can enable additional languages.  
  
 The following table shows tasks that are associated with changing regional and language options for your organization.  
  
|Task|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|**Set the base language**|The base language determines default settings for regional and language options in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. After the base language is set, you can’t change it.|  
|**Enable or disable languages**|You can enable or disable available languages in the **Settings** area. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Enable or disable languages](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=513230)|  
|**Add and remove currencies**|Similar to setting the base language, you select your organization's base currency during the purchasing process for a subscription to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. After the base currency is set, you can’t change it.<br /><br /> However, if your organization uses more than one currency to track financial transactions, you can add currencies.|  
|**Deactivate or activate currency records**|You can’t delete currency records that are being used by other records, such as opportunities or invoices. However, you can deactivate currency records so they won’t be available for future transactions.|

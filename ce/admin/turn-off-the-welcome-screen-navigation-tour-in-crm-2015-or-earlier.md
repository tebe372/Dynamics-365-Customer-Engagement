# Turn off the welcome screen (navigation tour) in CRM 2015 or earlier
When people first start Dynamics CRM 2015 or earlier, they are offered a quick overview. They can start the navigation tour by choosing **Let’s go**.

 ![Disable navigation tour in Dynamics 365](../admin/media/crm-itpro-admin-nt-disablenavtour.PNG "Disable navigation tour in Dynamics 365")  
  
 If they don’t want to see the welcome screen (navigation tour) each time they start, they can select the **Don't show me this again** check box, to turn it off. However, they will see the welcome screen again, if they log in from a different device, use a new browser, or delete their cache. As an administrator, you can turn off the welcome screen (navigation tour) permanently for the whole organization, so, it doesn’t re-appear every time the users sign in to CRM 2015.  
  
 To do that:  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_administration](../includes/proc-settings-administration.md)]  
  
2.  Choose the **System Settings** > **General** tab.  
  
3.  In **Set whether users see navigation tour**, set the **Display navigation tour to users when they sign in** to **No**, as shown below:

# Secure sensitive data by enabling encryption
To provide an additional layer of security, you can encrypt the data in some fields that contain sensitive data, including user names and passwords. When you enable encryption, even database administrators can’t see the password data.  
  
 Dynamics 365 users who have the System Administrator security role can enable data encryption or change the encryption key after enabling data encryption.

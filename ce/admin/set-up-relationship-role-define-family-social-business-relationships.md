# Set up a relationship role to define family, social, or business relationships
Identifying informal kinds of relationships between records that include family, social, or business contacts can be useful. For example, it may be helpful to know if two contacts are married, or if a contact used to work for another account. These types of relationships were known as customer relationship entities and are now called connections. To create these types of relationships, see [Create connections to view relationships between records](../basics/create-connections-view-relationships-between-records.md).

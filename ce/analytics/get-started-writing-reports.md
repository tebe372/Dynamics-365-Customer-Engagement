# Get started writing reports
[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] uses [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] report definition language (RDL) reports to query Dynamics 365 data and return refined results back to the report user. For more information about RDL, see [Report Definition Language (SSRS)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ms155062.aspx).  
  
 To create or modify existing RDL reports that can be used with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], use FetchXML, which is then converted to RDL by using report authoring tools. .  
  
 If you want, you can use a third-party tool, SQL2FetchXML, to convert your SQL scripts to FetchXML, and then use the FetchXML query in your Fetch-based reports. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [SQL2FetchXML Help](http://www.sql2fetchxml.com/help.aspx)

# What's new in Voice of the Customer for Dynamics 365

Welcome to Voice of the Customer for [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)]. Here's a list of features we added and updated recently.

## Voice of the Customer version 9.0.1027.16

Following are the new and updated features in this release:
- **Cascade delete of survey**: The reliability and experience of survey delete operation are improved. All the dependent entities of a survey are deleted when the survey is deleted. The prerequisite user actions, if required, for deleting the survey are displayed on the screen.
- **Reconfigure Voice of the Customer**: You can now repair or restore the Voice of the Customer configuration if it is accidentally deleted or misconfigured.

# What's new in Voice of the Customer for Dynamics 365

Welcome to Voice of the Customer for [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)]. Here's a list of features we added recently.

## Voice of the Customer version 9.0.1027.16

Following are the new features in this release:
- **Cascade delete of survey**: When you delete a survey, all its related entities are now also deleted.
- **Reconfigure Voice of the Customer**: If the Voice of the Customer solution is misconfigured, you can now allow it to automatically setup the correct configurations itself.

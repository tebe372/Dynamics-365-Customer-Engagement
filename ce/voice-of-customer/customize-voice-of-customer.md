# Customize survey settings
You can start using surveys right away, without any extra configuration. If you have specific customizations you would like to make, however, you can customize the HTML or XML for these elements:  
  
-   Email Face Template  
  
-   Email NPS Template  
  
-   Email Rating Template  
  
-   Feedback Charts  
  
-   Feedback Dashboards  
  
-   Feedback Form - Actions Tab  
  
-   Feedback Form - Empty Response Section  
  
-   Feedback Form - Feedback Tab  
  
-   Feedback Form - General Tab  
  
-   Feedback Form - Score Tab  
  
 You can also import XML from an existing survey.

# Install the Voice of the Customer solution
[!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer-full](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer-full.md)] is a preferred solution that you install from [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)]. To learn how to install preferred solutions, see [TechNet: Install a preferred solution](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn878909).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer-full](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer-full.md)] preferred solution connects to an external service that isn't completely within the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] compliance boundary.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer-full](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer-full.md)] has the following limitations designed to optimize performance:  
>   
> -   Maximum # of surveys you can publish: **200**  
> -   Maximum # of questions on a survey: **250**. If you've enabled feedback for a survey, you can include a maximum of 40 questions.  
> -   Maximum # of pages per survey: **25**  
> -   Maximum # of email invitations you can send in 24-hour period that includes piped data: **10,000**. Any emails that exceed that amount will remain pending during that time and will automatically start sending when the time limit is over.
> -   Maximum # of survey responses that [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer.md)] will pull per day: **2400**
> -   Maximum # of survey responses that [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer.md)] will store: **1,000,000** 
> -   Note that surveys aren't supported on legacy forms. 
>    
> The following limitations also apply if you're using a version earlier than 9.0.781.3. If you're not sure which version you're using, talk to your administrator. If you're an administrator, you can find the version by going to **Settings>Solutions**.

## What should I do if survey responses are not received after creating a custom plugin on the Survey Response entity?

The VOC Push Service user runs only with minimum required privileges to communicate to Voice of the Customer Azure service, and if your organization deploys a custom plugin that runs on the Survey Response entity, you are advised to do either of following:
- Run the custom plugin in System User Context.
- Create a custom role with privileges required by custom plugin operations and assign the security role to Voice of the Customer application user.

## What should I do if the survey responses are not submitted successfully in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps?

There might be times when a customer has submitted a survey response, but it is not submitted successfully in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps. To view the responses that are not submitted successfully: 

1. Open Voice of the Customer app. 

2. Go to Advanced Find and search for the Response Errors entity. 

3. On the **Advanced Find** tab, select **Results**. The response errors along with the associated survey, response ID, error message, error code, and other required details are displayed in a grid format. 

    For example: 

    - If a survey response is not stored in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps after trying multiple times, error code 103 is displayed along with the appropriate error message. 
    - If a survey does not exist, error code 201 is displayed along with the appropriate error message. 
    - If a survey invite does not exist, error code 202 is displayed along with the appropriate error message.

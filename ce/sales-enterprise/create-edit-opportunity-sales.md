# Create or edit an opportunity (Sales and Sales Hub)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

An opportunity is a lead who is now almost ready to buy&mdash;in other words, a deal that you're ready to win.  
  
 At this point in the sales process, you're most likely in either the **Develop** or **Propose** stage. [!include[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Nurture sales from lead to order](../sales-enterprise/nurture-sales-from-lead-order-sales.md) 
  
## Create an opportunity (Sales Hub)

If you're following the sales process from start to finish, you *qualify* a lead to turn it into an *opportunity*. [!include[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Qualify a lead and convert it to an opportunity](../sales-enterprise/qualify-lead-convert-opportunity-sales.md)
1. Select the site map ![Site Map icon](media/site-map-icon.png "site map icon"), and then select **Opportunities**.

2. If you've qualified a lead to an opportunity, open the opportunity from the list.

    or

    To create a new opportunity, on the command bar, select **+ New**.

3. In the opportunity form, make sure that your potential customer's important details are captured. If you've qualified a lead to an opportunity, most of the fields will be automatically populated from the lead record.
 
   - **Topic**: What the customer is interested in that created the opportunity, such as specific product details.
 
   - **Contact**: The contact associated with this opportunity.
 
   - **Account**: The account associated with this opportunity.
 
   - **Purchase Timeframe**: The timeframe by when the account or contact is likely to make the purchase.
 
   - **Budget Amount** 
 
   - **Purchase Process**: Whether the purchase process involves an individual or a committee.
 
   - **Est. Close Date**: An estimated date by which the opportunity is expected to close. 
 
   - **Est. Revenue**: A field calculated for opportunities that have products added to them. Estimated revenue is calculated based on base price, volume discounts, manual discounts, taxes, and other pricing modifications. When opportunities are saved, [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] recalculates the estimated revenue based on any changes to the products or product quantities associated with the opportunity.

4.	Select **Save** to enable other sections on the form.

5.	In the **Stakeholders** section, select the **More Commands** button ![More Commands button](media/more-button-stakeholders-grid.png "More Commands button"), and then select **+ New Connection** to add a contact as a stakeholder. A *stakeholder* is a key contact at the account who will be involved in decision-making. 

    In the **Lookup Records** dialog box, enter a name or select the Lookup icon to choose from a list of suggestions. When you have entered the name you want, select **Add**.

8.	To save your changes, on the command bar, select **Save**.

9.	Add products to your opportunity. [!include[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Add products to an opportunity](#add-products-to-an-opportunity-sales-hub) 

10.	Follow the process bar to move the opportunity to the next stage. In the **Develop** stage, enter data for the following fields:
    
    - **Customer Need**: Enter what interests the customer, such as specific product requirements.
    
    - **Proposed Solution**: Enter the plan for what your organization can offer the account, such as product details.
    
    - **Identify Stakeholders**: Select **mark complete** to indicate that you've included information about who will be involved in pursuing the opportunity.
    
    - **Identify Competitors**: Select **mark complete** to indicate that you've included information about competitors.

11. In the **Propose** stage, select **mark complete** to display a check mark next to each of the following steps that you've completed:
    
    - **Identify Sales Team**  
    
    - **Develop Proposal** (this optional step indicates that you've included notes about how the account will be approached)  
    
    - **Complete Internal Review**  
    
    - **Present Proposal**  

The next step is to create a quote and send it to your customer. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create a quote and send it to your customer](../sales-enterprise/create-edit-quote-sales.md)

## Add products to an opportunity (Sales Hub)

You can add a product or product bundle to an opportunity. The product can be an existing product in [!INCLUDE[pn-sales-enterprise-doc-name-shortest](../includes/pn-sales-enterprise-doc-name-shortest.md)] product catalog, or an ad hoc product that you add as a write-in product. Any products added to opportunity are automatically associated with quotes generated from the opportunity.

1. In the list of opportunities, open the opportunity to which you want to add products.

2. Go to the **Product Line Items** tab.

3. Select a **Price List**. The price list determines the cost of the product. Selecting a price list is required to be able to add products to an opportunity. 

4. If you want the estimated revenue of the opportunity to be calculated based on the total amount, set **Revenue** to **System Calculated**. If you want to use a custom estimated revenue, set it to **User Provided**.

5. In the **Product Line Items** grid, select **Add New Opportunity Product**.

6. In the **New Opportunity Product** form, do the following:  

    1.  **Select Product**: Set the switch to choose whether you want to add an existing product or create a new one:
    
        -  To use an existing product, select **Lookup** to search for and add a product.
         
        -  To create a product, select **Write-In**, and then enter the name of the product.
    
    2.  **Pricing**. Select the pricing option. By default, this is the per unit price that is listed in the product catalog. To override the catalog price, select **Override Price**. When you override the price, you can specify a price that you want to charge for each unit of the product.   

    3.  **Quantity**. Enter the quantity of the product or service that will be included.  

    4.  **Manual Discount**. If you want to offer a discount to the product price, enter it here.  
    
    5.  **Tax**. If required, enter the appropriate tax amount.  
   
7. Select **Save**.

The **Product Line Items** grid shows all the products that are associated with the opportunity. If you added an existing product from the product catalog, you can change the quantity and discount of the product inline in the **Product Line Items** grid. If you added a write-in product, you can also change the price of the product in addition to the quantity and discount.

The icon for each product line item show whether it is a product, product bundle, or a product family. 
Here are the actions you can take on the products added to the Product Line Items grid:

The Suggestions pane shows all the products that are defined as related products for the current product. Select the related products that you want to add, and then select **OK**. |
|See specific records together by moving a record up or down in the grid | Select a record, and on the command bar, use the **Up** or **Down** button. |


## Recalculate an opportunity (Sales Hub)

3.	In the grid, modify the list of products associated with the opportunity.

## Create an opportunity  (Sales app)
 If you're following the sales process from start to finish, you qualify a lead to turn it into an opportunity. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Nurture sales from lead to order](../sales-enterprise/nurture-sales-from-lead-order-sales.md)  

 If you want to create an opportunity without first creating a lead, do the following:  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_sales_opportunities](../includes/proc-sales-opportunities.md)]  
  
2.  Select **New**.  
  
3.  In the **Summary** area, enter the company and contact information for the opportunity.  
  
4.  In the **Details** area of the **Opportunity** form, enter information about your opportunity's industry and preferred contact method.  
  
5.  Add any notes and activities (for example, phone calls or emails) related to this opportunity. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Keep track of notes, tasks, calls, or email with activities](../basics/work-with-activities.md)  
  
6.  In the **Stakeholders** section, select the **Add Connection record** button ![Add Connection record button](media/add-connection-record-button.png "Add Connection record button") to add a contact as a stakeholder. A *stakeholder* is a key contact at the account who will be involved in decision-making. 

    In the Lookup box, enter a name or select the Lookup icon to choose from a list of suggestions. To create a new contact, select **+ New**. By default, the contact you add is assigned the Stakeholder role. Select the Role corresponding to the contact to select a different role such as Decision Maker or Technical Buyer.   
  
7.  In the **Sales Team** section, select the**Add Connection record** button ![Add Connection record button](media/add-connection-record-button.png "Add Connection record button"), and then select **+ New Connection** to add a member of the sales team (from your organization).

11. Select **Save** in the lower-right corner of the screen. 
  
## Additional considerations  
  
-   A way that might help you increase your sales is to add all products that your customer might need. You can add product bundles or product families to make it easier for you to choose products for upsell and cross-sell.  
  
-   If other people in your organization are working on this sale, be sure to add them as sales team members.  
  
-   Nurture your opportunities through a marketing campaign. [!include[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Get started with in-app marketing](../sales-enterprise/get-started-app-marketing-sales.md) (applies to the Sales app only)

# Create or edit an opportunity (Sales, Enterprise)
An opportunity is a lead who is now almost ready to buy—in other words, it’s a deal that you’re ready to win.  
  
 At this point in the sales process, you’re most likely in either the **Develop** or **Propose** stage. More information: [Nurture sales from lead to order](../sales-enterprise/nurture-sales-from-lead-order-sales.md)

## Create an opportunity  
 If you’re following the sales process from start to finish, you qualify a lead to turn it into an opportunity. More information: [Nurture sales from lead to order](../sales-enterprise/nurture-sales-from-lead-order-sales.md)  
  
 If you want to create an opportunity without first creating a lead, do the following:  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_sales_opportunities](../includes/proc-sales-opportunities.md)]  
  
2.  Choose **New**.  
  
3.  In the **Summary** area of the **Lead** screen, type your lead’s company and contact information.  
  
4.  In the **Details** area of the **Lead** screen, type information about your lead’s industry and preferred contact method.  
  
5.  Add any notes and activities (for example, phone calls or emails) related to this lead. More information: [Keep track of notes, tasks, calls, or email with activities](../basics/keep-track-notes-tasks-calls-email-with-activities.md)  
  
6.  To add stakeholders, in the **Stakeholders** area, choose **+**.  
  
7.  To add sales team members, in the **Sales Team** area, choose **+**.  
  
8.  To add competitors, in the **Competitors** area, choose **+**.  
  
9. To add products, in the **Products** area, choose **+**.  
  
10. To add a quote, in the **Quotes** area, choose **+**. More information: [Create or edit a quote](../sales-enterprise/create-edit-quote-sales.md)  
  
11. Choose the **Save** button on the bottom right of the screen.

## Edit an opportunity  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_sales_opportunities](../includes/proc-sales-opportunities.md)]  
  
2.  Choose the opportunity you want to edit.  
  
3.  Add any extra details you have about your lead.  
  
4.  Choose the **Save** button on the bottom right of the screen.  
  
## Add stakeholders to an opportunity  
 Be sure to add all stakeholders for your project. A stakeholder is anyone who should participate in, review, or approve your proposed solution.  
  
1.  Open the opportunity.  
  
2.  In the **Stakeholders** section, click ![Add a record button](../sales-enterprise/media/add-record-button.gif "Add a record button"), and then select the person’s name.  
  
3.  From the drop-down list, select the person’s role.

## Additional considerations  
  
-   A way that might help you increase your sales is to add all products that your customer might need. You can add product bundles or product families to make it easier for you to choose products for upsell and cross-sell.  
  
-   If other people in your organization are working on this sale, be sure to add them as sales team members.  
  
-   Nurture your opportunities through a marketing campaign. More information: [Get started with in-app marketing](../sales-enterprise/get-started-with-app-marketing-sales.md)

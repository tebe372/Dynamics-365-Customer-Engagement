# Create or edit an invoice (Sales, Enterprise)
When a customer places an order, you can create an invoice to bill them for the upcoming sale.  
  
 Typically, you convert an order into an invoice. However, you can also create an invoice that does not originate from an order.

## Create an invoice from an order  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_sales_orders](../includes/proc-sales-orders.md)]  
  
2.  Choose the order you want to create an invoice from.  
  
3.  Choose **Create Invoice** at the top of the screen.  
  
4.  Review the contents of the invoice and make any additions or corrections before sending to your customer.

## Create an invoice  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_sales_invoices](../includes/proc-sales-invoices.md)]  
  
2.  Choose **New**.  
  
3.  Add your customer’s contact information.  
  
4.  Choose **Save** at the top left to create the invoice record.  
  
5.  To add products from your opportunity to your order, choose **Get Products** at the top of the screen, select your opportunity, and click **OK**.  
  
6.  To add information about a product on the invoice, in the **Products** area, choose the **Add a Product** button ![Add button](../sales-enterprise/media/add-button.PNG "Add button"), and then choose one of the following options:  
  
    - **Existing Product**. A product created in the product catalog that is associated with a price list.  
  
    - **Write-in Product**. A product that is available but not a part of the product catalog.  
  
    - **Get Products**. Select products from a previously created opportunity.  
  
     You need to enter the tax amount when you add a product to a quote, order, or invoice. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] doesn’t automatically calculate tax for individual products. However, the total tax is calculated automatically based on the sum of the tax amounts for all of the individual products in a quote, order, or invoice.  
  
7.  In the **Shipping Information** area, type shipping details.  
  
8.  In the **Addresses** area, type shipping and billing addresses.  
  
9. Choose the **Save** button at the bottom right corner of the screen.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You close an invoice either by canceling the invoice or setting the invoice status as paid.

# Enable customization of the Opportunity Close form

To allow users in your organization to capture more relevant details about an opportunity closing, a system administrator can enable the customization of the Opportunity Close form.

> [!NOTE]
> The capability to customize the **Opportunity Close** form is supported only in the sales app built on Unified Interface.

To enable customization:

1.  In your app, on the navigation bar, select the **Settings** icon ![Settings icon on the navigation bar](media/settings-icon.png "Settings icon on the navigation bar"), and then select **Advanced Settings**.

    The **Business Management settings** page opens in a new browser tab.

1.  On the navigation bar, select **Settings**, and then select **Administration**.

2.  Select **System Settings**.

3.  In the **System Settings** dialog box, on the **Sales** tab, set the **Customize close opportunity form** field to **Yes**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Customize opportunity close option in System Settings](media/system-setting-customize-close-opportunity-form.png "Customize opportunity close option in System Settings")

4.  Select **OK**.


If you're using a custom app, in addition to enabling the customization of opportunity close form, you must also add the Opportunity Close entity to the custom app in the app designer.

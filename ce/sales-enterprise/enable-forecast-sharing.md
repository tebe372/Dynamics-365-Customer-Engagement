## Enable or disable forecast sharing

Forecast sharing is disabled by default. As an administrator or forecast manager, enable the forecast sharing option for the forecasts that needs to be shared. Users can only share forecast records that they have access to.

**To enable forecast sharing**

1.  From the **Change area** in Sales Hub, select **App Settings**.

2.  Select **Forecast configuration** under **Performance management**.

3.  Select the forecast configuration for which you want to enable sharing.

4.  Select the **Permissions** step and specify the share permissions. Select one of the following options:

- **No share**: Indicates that forecast sharing is disabled and hence cannot be shared with anyone. If you select this option when there are active shares, the shared forecasts will no longer be available to the users.

- **Share as read-only**: Indicates that the users in the forecast hierarchy can share the forecast with view permission.

- **Share as read and adjust rollups**: Indicates that the forecast can be shared with either the view only permission, or read and adjust permission. If you want to be able to share the forecast with different levels of access to different users, then select this setting.

## Share a forecast

You can share a forecast with anyone in your hierarchy or outside of your hierarchy and specify the access level (such as read or read and adjust rollup) that you want to give the user. For example, Henry, the Sales Manager wants one of his direct reports, Serena Davis, to manage the forecasts while he's on vacation. He can share his forecast hierarchy with Serena and assign the appropriate permissions.

1.  Go to **Performance &gt; Forecasts** in the Sales Hub sitemap.

You will now see the **Share** icon ![](media/image5.png) next to the forecasts that are enabled for sharing. If you do not see the Share icon, contact your administrator to enable forecast sharing.

2.  Select the **Share** icon ![](media/image5.png) next to a specific forecast record or hierarchy.

3.  In the **Sharing** dialog, specify the users with whom you want to share the forecast and select the pencil icon to specify the access level.

**Note:** You can specify different level of access for each user if your administrator has set the **Share as read and adjust rollups** option.

The selected forecast record or hierarchy is shared with the specified users.

## Stop sharing a forecast

To stop sharing a forecast from a user, select the **Share** icon listed next to the forecast record. In the **Sharing** dialog, find the user you want to stop sharing with and select the **Delete** icon next to the username. To stop sharing the entire forecast hierarchy from all the users, your administrator needs to disable the sharing option for the forecast.

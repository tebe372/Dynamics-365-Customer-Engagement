Forecasting helps organizations to project how much a sales team can sell or to estimate the revenue of the organization. This information in turn provides necessary insights into how to manage their resources or cash flow.

Similarly, sales people can use forecasting to prevent deals from slipping away by spotting pipeline risks and tracking how they are performing against their targets.

To start forecasting, a sales manager must create a forecast that has information about parameters such as the period for which the forecast should be generated or the data to use for forecasting. To learn more, see [Configure forecast](configure-forecast.md).

An option set must be added to display the columns to determine the different confidence levels of an opportunity as it moves through the different stages before it is converted to a sale. You can also add a custom option set to the forecast if it is defined specifically for your organization. For example, when you select the entity as opportunities and the option set as **Forecast categories**. The forecast grid displays the stages that are defined in the option set. To learn more about the different stages **Forecast categories** option set, see [Capture forecast category for opportunity](capture-forecast-category-opportunity.md).

# Project accurate revenue with sales forecasting

A forecast helps your organization predict how much revenue your sales team will generate in a given timeframe. When done correctly, it can play a significant role in your company's success. Using a forecast:

- Sellers can track performance against their targets and identify pipeline risks that could jeopardize the ability to hit the targets.

- Managers can track individual sales performance against quotas to pro-actively provide coaching.

- Directors can use the forecast trends to anticipate departmental sales and reallocate resources.

- Organization leaders can use the projected estimates to change the product strategy or convey updated projections to investors.

-	At least a forecast is created with one of the following options:

# Project accurate revenue with sales forecasting

A forecast helps your organization predict how much revenue your sales team will generate in a given timeframe. When done correctly, it can play a significant role in your company's success. By using a forecast:

- Sellers can track their performance against targets and identify pipeline risks that might jeopardize their ability to hit the targets.

- Managers can track individual sales performance against quotas, to proactively provide coaching.

- Directors can use forecast trends to anticipate departmental sales and reallocate resources if necessary.

- Organization leaders can use projected estimates to change product strategy or convey updated projections to investors.

## Review prerequisites
<!--note from editor: Is the edit to the first bullet item okay? I didn't know what "At least a forecast is created" meant. Also, in line 39 is "must" accurate? It didn't seem definite enough to say you "should" have read privileges.-->
Review the following prerequisites before using forecasts:

 -  The forecast was created with at least one of the following options:

    -  A hierarchy that you're part of.

    -  A security role that you're part of has been granted access.

    To learn more, see [Configure a forecast](configure-forecast.md).

-  You must have read privileges for User and Territory entities. To learn more, see [Security roles and privileges](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges).

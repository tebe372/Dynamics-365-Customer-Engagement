# Personalize deal manager (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A preview is a feature that is not complete, but is made available to you before general availability so you can evaluate the preview and provide feedback to Microsoft. Previews may have restricted functionality and may employ reduced or different privacy, security, or compliance commitments than a commercial version. As such, previews are not intended for production use, which means they are not meant for "live" Customer Data, Personal Data, or other data that is subject to heightened compliance requirements. Use of such data is at your sole risk and it's your sole responsibility to notify your end users about not including personal or sensitive information with their use of previews, as appropriate. We don't provide support for previews and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won't be able to help you with issues or questions. This preview, and any one-off support Microsoft may elect to provide, is provided "as-is," "with all faults," "as available," and without warranty.

As a seller, you can personalize the deal manager workspace to suit your needs. You can,

- Add, remove columns from the grid depending on what you would like to see and update quickly.
- Show or hide columns in the grid.
- Resize, sort, and group records by columns in the grid.  
- Apply filters to view records that are important for you.
- Change the layout of the workspace to either list (grid only) or combo (grid and chart).  
- Change the stats displayed at the top of the workspace.
- Save all your personalization changes as a view so that you don't have to modify every time.  
- Create multiple views and switch between them easily.

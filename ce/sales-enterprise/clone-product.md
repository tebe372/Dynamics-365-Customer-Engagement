# Clone products (Sales and Sales Hub)

When you're creating a new product, family or bundle, save time by cloning an existing one. This creates a copy of the original record with all the details except for the name and ID. If the product, bundle or family has any properties, they're also copied to the cloned record.  
  
## Clone a product (Sales Hub)

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_admin_cust_mgr_vp_sales_ceo](../includes/proc-permissions-admin-cust-mgr-vp-sales-ceo.md)]  
  
2. In the site map, select **Products**.   
  
3. Select a product family, product, or bundle record that you want to clone, and on the command bar, select **Clone**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![List of products with Clone button](media/clone-product.png "List of products with Clone button")

    A confirmation dialog box appears.
    
    ![Confirm cloning of product](media/confirm-clone-product.png "Confirm cloning of product")

4. Select **Confirm**.
    
    A new product record will open with the same details as the original one except for the name and ID.  
  
    The new record is created under the same parent node as the original one.

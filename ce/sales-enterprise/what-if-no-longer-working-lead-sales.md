# What if you're no longer working a lead? (Sales and Sales Hub)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Let's say you've been talking to a lead, and you determine that continuing to work the lead wouldn't be worth the time, at least not right now. Not great news, but it happens.  
  
 You'll need to disqualify the lead, and give the reason.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  While you could delete the lead, doing that isn't recommended. Deletions can't be undone, and deleting a lead also deletes any notes and documents associated with the lead. Instead, disqualify the lead to preserve the history. In addition, disqualifying the lead allows you to reopen the lead later if needed.  
  
1.  Open the lead.  
  
2.  On the command bar, select **Disqualify**, and then select the reason.

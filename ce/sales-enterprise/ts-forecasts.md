## Forecast definition issues and resolution

<a name="publish_forecast_definition"> </a>
### Issue: I can't publish forecast definition 

**Reason:**

There might be several reasons related to publishing failure. The following are examples that might cause a failure: 
- Some users under the selected hierarchy might not be assigned the forecast manager or forecast user role. 
- Some users are disabled under the selected hierarchy when you publish the forecast definition.  

**Resolution:**

1. Go to **Settings** > **System Jobs**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Open settings page](media/troubleshooting-forecast-settings.png  "Open settings page")
    
    The system jobs page opens.

2. Identify the forecast definition publishing job that failed. If it's difficult to identify the job in the list of system jobs, use the **Regarding** column to find the failed job with the forecast definition's title. In this example, the failed forecast definition title is **Bert FY'19**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![System jobs page](media/troubleshooting-forecast-system-jobs.png "System jobs page")
    
3. Select the System Job Name to view the error details. In this example, the system job name that corresponds to **Bert FY'19** is selected.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select failed system job](media/troubleshooting-forecast-system-job-select.png "Select failed system job")

4. In the **information** page, you can see the error message highlighted in **Yellow** with the reason why the forecast definition publishing failed. Select the **Details** section to see more details about the error. In this example, you can see that the error occurred because of insufficient user privileges in Bert's hierarchy. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Failed reason in information page](media/troubleshooting-forecast-system-job-failed-reason.png "Failed reason in information page")

5. Take the necessary actions to resolve the error and republish the forecast definition. 
    
    To resolve the error in this example, assign Forecast manager or Forecast user roles to all the users under Bert's hierarchy as required, and republish the forecast definition.

### I can't recalculate the forecast

**Reason:**

There might be several reasons related to the failure of recalculation of the forecast. The following are some examples that might cause a failure: 
- User roles (forecast manager or forecast user) might have been removed under the selected hierarchy after the forecast was created. 
- In the **Forecast metric** value, for the **Revenue** field, the **Rollup Fields** value has changed.

**Resolution:**

1. Go to **Change area** and select **Sales** > **Forecasts**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select forecasts](media/troubleshooting-forecast-changearea-sales-forecasts.png "Select forecasts")

    A list of published forecasts is displayed.

2. The **Last recalculated on** column displays an error icon corresponding to the recalculation failed forecast. Place your cursor over the icon and a message or reason for the error is displayed.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![View recalculation failed icon](media/troubleshooting-forecast-recalculation-failed-error-message.png "View recalculation failed icon")

4. Take the necessary actions to resolve the error and recalculate the forecast.

# Print quote, invoice, or other records

If you need a hard copy of a record such as a contact, lead, quote, or invoice, you can print records individually. 

1. Go to the record you want to print. For example, to print an invoice, go to Sales > Invoices and select a record.

2. On the command bar, select **Export to PDF**, and then select the template you want to use to create the PDF. More information: [Create PDF files from sales records](create-quote-pdf.md)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the **Export to PDF** option, contact your administrator to [Enable PDF file generation from sales record](enable-pdf-generation-quote.md).

3. Download the PDF file to your local drive. 

4. Open the downloaded PDF file, and print it.

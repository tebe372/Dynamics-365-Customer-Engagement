# Preview: Add products to an opportunity by using the enhanced experience

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

For salespeople, it's important to be able to quickly update opportunities by adding products that their customers are interested in. With the enhanced experience of adding products, salespeople can:

-  Quickly find products from the catalog based on free-text search, or filter products based on the product family or views.

-  See the most-recently-used list of products while adding multiple products.

-  View product details inline and compare products before selecting any, which helps them find the right product.

-  Select and add multiple products in one go.

-  Add write-in products by using as few clicks as possible.

-  Specify price, quantity, and any other required information as configured by your system administrator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The enhanced experience for adding products is a preview feature. [!INCLUDE[cc-preview-features-definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]
> - [!INCLUDE[cc-preview-features-expect-changes](../includes/cc-preview-features-expect-changes.md)]
> - [!INCLUDE[cc-preview-features-no-ms-support](../includes/cc-preview-features-no-ms-support.md)]

**To add a product by using the enhanced experience**

1.  From the list of opportunities, open the opportunity to which you want to add products.

2.  Go to the **Product Line Items** tab.

3.  Select a **Price List**. The price list determines the cost of the product.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, you must select a price list to be able to add products to an opportunity; however, your administrator can change your organization settings to make the **Price List** field optional.

4.  If you want the estimated revenue of the opportunity to be calculated based on all the products added to the opportunity, set **Revenue** to **System Calculated**. If you want to use a custom estimated revenue, set it to **User Provided**.

5.  In the **Product Line Items** grid, select **Add products**.

    The **Add products** dialog box opens.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Add products dialog box](media/add-products-dialog-box.png "Add products dialog box")

    You can use this dialog box to edit line item details (product details) inline and also select multiple products at once. It has four tabs:

    - **Products**: This tab lists all the products and product bundles that are in the **Active** or **Revised** state. Along with entering the product name, you can also enter the price per unit and quantity. By default, 25 products are shown. On this tab, you can search and filter the list of products and select the one you want to add.

        If you've selected a price list for the opportunity, the product list is filtered to show only those product records that have the same price list associated.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > The columns that you see in the dialog box are based on the columns defined in the **Opportunity products Add products** view. You system administrator can customize this view to add the columns that are most useful for your business. 

    - **Recently used**: This tab lists the last 15 products that the currently signed-in user has added to any opportunity.

    - **Write-in**: On this tab, you can create and add a write-in product.

    - **Selected**: This tab shows the count of the products selected to be added to the opportunity. Use this tab to verify or modify the final list of the items you've selected.

6. Search for and select the products you want to add, and then select **Add to opportunity**.

## Search for products

On the **Products** tab, enter the keyword in the **Search** field, and then select the **Search** icon or the **Enter** key. The products matching the search criteria are shown.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Search box on the Products tab](media/search-for-products.png "Search box on the Products tab")

The search capability searches for the keyword in the product names or the fields of **Single Line of Text** or **Multiple Lines of Text** in the **Quick Find View** of the product table (entity). The search is performed by using the **Contains** search operator. This means that search results will show all the products that contain the keyword in one of the supported fields.

Here's how the search results are ranked:

- The records that have values that exactly match the keywords are shown first.

- The records that broadly match the keywords are shown next. For example, if you enter **Windows 8.1** as the search keyword, product records that contain either **Windows** or **8.1** in the name or other supported fields are shown.

## Filter products

The following filters are available to enable you to further narrow your search:

- **Product family**: Use this filter to see products in a specific product family. All Product families in the Active and Under revision state are shown.
- **Views**: Use this filter to see products in a specific saved view or user view. You can create a new view for the product table (entity).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Product family and View product filters](media/filter-products-enhanced.png "Product family and View product filters")

> [!NOTE]
> Search and filters work in conjunction. For example, if you've searched for a keyword and 50 results are showing, you can use a filter on top of this to further narrow your search.

## See product details (applies both to Products and Recently used tabs)

The additional details of the product&mdash;like product name and ID&mdash;are shown inline below the product name. These additional details help salespeople identify the correct product. The data shown here is based on the columns (fields) added in the **Product Lookup view** of the product table (entity). Your system administrator or system customizer can customize this view to add other fields that are relevant for your business.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Product details](media/add-products-product-details.png "Product details")

## Select products to add

**To select an existing product**

1. Go to the **Products** tab or the **Recently used** tab.
1. Select the check box next to the product that you want to add, and then enter the quantity of product. If you edit a row&mdash;for example, by entering a quantity for a product&mdash;that product is automatically selected.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Select the product to add](media/select-products-to-add-enh.png "Select the product to add")

1. Do one of the following:

   - If the product has a default price list associated with it, the **Price per unit** is populated in accordance with the associated price list. Enter the quantity. 

      > [!NOTE]
      > To be able to override the default price of a product, the administrator must add the **Price Overridden** column (field) to the grid. After the **Price Overridden** column has been added, select **Override Price**.

   - If the product doesn't have an associated price list, enter the price per unit and quantity.

**To add a write-in product**

1. Go to the **Write-in** tab.

2. Select **Write-in product**, and then enter the details in the **Product Name**, **Price Per Unit**, and **Quantity** columns.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Add a write-in product](media/add-write-in-product-enh.png "Add a write-in product")

## Review selected products

When you select a product to add, a count is added to the **Selected** tab at the top of the screen. The count represents the number of products selected. On the **Products** tab or the **Recently used** tab, a check mark is shown for all the products that you've selected.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Review selected products](media/review-selected-products-enh.png "Review selected products")

> [!NOTE]
> On the **Selected** tab, you can also change the details of the selected products. 

## Remove selected products

You can easily remove products that you selected earlier but don't need anymore.

To remove a product from the selection, go to the **Selected** tab. For the product that you want to remove, select the **Delete product** icon.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Remove selected products](media/remove-selected-products-enh.png "Remove selected products")

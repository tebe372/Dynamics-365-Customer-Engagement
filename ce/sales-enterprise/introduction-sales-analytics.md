# Introduction to Sales Analytics for Dynamics 365 Sales

Sales managers are responsible for managing sales representatives who work with customers to close deals every day. Sales managers need to have visibility over key operational and pipeline metrics to drive team performance.

Managers can see trends in these metrics over a period of time to understand how sellers are performing, so that they can take corrective measures, provide appropriate guidance to sellers, and improve the customer purchase experience.

As a sales manager, use this dashboard to perform the following tasks:

- Monitor sales pipeline, sales leaderboard, and top deals
- Analyze pipeline performance, won/lost deals, and lead closure

> [!NOTE]
> Contact your system administrator for configuration errors or if you are unable to view the dashboards.

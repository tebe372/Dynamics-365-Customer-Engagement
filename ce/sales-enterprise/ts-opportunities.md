# Troubleshooting the Opportunity entity 

This article helps you troubleshoot and resolve issues related to the Opportunity entity.

## Opportunity issues and resolution

### How do I close an opportunity?
      
Whether your customer has accepted or rejected your proposal, it's a good practice to close the opportunity as won or lost. 

When you close an opportunity, the opportunity is marked as complete, and can't be changed. To make further changes to an opportunity, you can reopen it. 


> [!NOTE]
> At the time of closing the opportunity, enter the Actual Revenue and Actual Close Date. The Actual Revenue is used for reporting purposes in charts and reports in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)].

To close an opportunity, open the opportunity record, and on the command bar, select **Close as Won** or **Close as Lost**.

### Issue: I can't close an opportunity

Here are some errors you might see when you close an opportunity: 
1.  [The opportunity cannot be closed](#CannotBeClosed)
2.  [Access denied or Insufficient permissions](#AccessDeniedOpportunity)
3.  [The opportunity has already been closed](#AlreadyClosed)

The following sections describe each of these errors and how you can resolve them.

<a name="CannotBeClosed"> </a> 
#### 1. The opportunity cannot be closed

**Reason:**

There might be active or draft quotes associated with the opportunity.

**Resolution:**

1. In the Opportunity record, go to the **Quotes** tab (or **Quotes line item** tab).
2. Make sure none of the quotes is in the Draft or Active status.

<a name="AccessDeniedOpportunity"> </a> 
#### 2. Access denied or Insufficient permissions.

**Reason:**

You don't have sufficient permissions on the opportunity you're trying to close.

**Resolution:**

Ask your system administrator to grant you the necessary permissions.

<a name="AlreadyClosed"> </a>
#### 3. The opportunity has already been closed.

**Reason:**

The opportunity that you're trying to close is already marked as Won or Lost. 

**Resolution:**

If you want to make changes to the already closed opportunity, reopen the opportunity, make changes, and close it again.

### Issue: I can't edit an opportunity

If you've already closed an opportunity as Won or Lost, it becomes read-only and you can't change it. To make any changes to a closed opportunity, reopen it. 

To reopen, open the opportunity, and on the command bar, select **Reopen Opportunity**.

### I can't add products to an opportunity

1.  [You must select a price list before attempting to add a product](#SelectPriceList)

<a name="ProductName"></a>

#### 3. You can only add active products.

**Reason:** 

When adding an existing product, you selected a product in the **Draft** status.

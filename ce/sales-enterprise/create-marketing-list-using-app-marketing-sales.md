# Create a marketing list using in-app marketing (Sales)

Your marketing list is the core of running a successful marketing campaign. It can include any one type of customer record, such as leads, accounts, or contacts.  
  
 You can create two types of marketing lists:  
  
- **Static** Use a static list if you prefer to add and update members manually.  
  
- **Dynamic** Use a dynamic marketing list if you want the list to return a list of members dynamically when needed, based on search criteria you set. For example, if you want to run a campaign to members of a specific city, use a dynamic list. A dynamic marketing list retrieves the updated list of members each time you open the list, create a quick campaign from the list, or distribute a campaign activity for a campaign associated with the list.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can add up to 120,000 members to a static marketing list in one Add operation. If you need to add more than 120,000 members to a static marketing list, split those members into multiple add operations. One way to do this is by using the [Advanced Find](#add-using-advanced-find) dialog to create queries that return less than 120,000 members. Alternatively, depending on your scenario, you can also consider using a dynamic marketing list instead of static list. More information: [Create a dynamic marketing list](#define-the-member-selection-criteria-for-a-dynamic-marketing-list)

3.  Click **Equals**, and then select a query relational operator.  
  
4.  Click **Enter Value**, and then type the value that you want to locate (for example, "Seattle" or "Email").

# Send email using the enhanced email experience

The enhanced email experience in model-driven apps allows users to compose an email without leaving the record they're working on. With the enhanced email experience, you can:

- Navigate to different pages without losing the email content.
- Minimize the email window to get back to the records you were working on.
- Expand the email editor pop-up window to see more email options.
- Simultaneously open three email compose pop-up windows.
- Search for and apply a predefined template to an email you're composing.
- Insert attachments to email.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - System administrators must enable the enhanced email experience before you can use it.
> - The enhanced email experience is available only for email activities created from the **Timeline** section of any model-driven app. 

Compose an email using the enhanced experience:

1. In the **Timeline** section of records such as account or contact, select **+** and then under **Activities**, select **Email**.

   A new email pop-up window opens. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Enhanced email pop-up window](media/enhanced-email-pop-up.png "Enhanced email pop-up window")

   The **From** and **To** fields are automatically populated based on the user and the account and contact of the original record.

2. Write your email from scratch or select **Insert Template** to search for and apply a template. For more information on inserting an email template, see [Insert an email template](insert-email-template.md).

3. Select **Attach file** if you want to add attachments.

4. Select **Insert signature** to search for and add your signature.

5. When you're done, select **Send**. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The enhanced email pop-up window opens only when the height and width of your screen size is at least 400 x 650 pixels or greater. If lower, you will be taken to the standard form instead of the enhanced email experience.

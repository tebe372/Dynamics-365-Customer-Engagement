Compose and send email using the enhanced email experience

The enhanced email experience in Dynamics 365 Sales allows sales reps to compose an email without leaving the record they’re working on. With the enhanced email experience, you can:

- Navigate to different pages without losing the email content.
- Minimize the email window to get back to the records they were working on.
- Expand the email editor pop-up to see more email options.
- Simultaneously open three email compose pop-ups at the same time.
- Search for and apply a predefined template to an email they’re composing
- Insert attachments to email.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> System administrators must enable the enhanced email experience before you can use it.

To compose and email using the enhanced experience,

1. In the account, contact, lead, or opportunity records, in the **Timeline** section, select **+** and then under **Activities**, select **Email** .

    An email pop up opens. 

    [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    ![Enhanced email pop-up](media/enhanced-email-pop-up.png "Enhanced email pop-up")

    The From and To fields are automatically populated based on the logged in user and the account and contact of the original record.

2. Write your email from scratch or select **Insert Template** to search for and apply a template. 

3. Select **Attach file** to add attachments.

4. Select **Insert signature** to search for and add your signature .

5. Once done, select **Send**. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The enhanced email pop-up opens only when the height and width of your screen size is greater than 600 px and 840 px respectively. If it is lower, you will be navigated to the Email form from wherever you are in the app, and the context won't be preserved.

# Compose and send email using the enhanced email experience

The enhanced email experience in Dynamics 365 Sales allows sales reps to compose an email without leaving the record theyâ€™re working on. With the enhanced email experience, you can:


<!--from editor: pop-up shouldn't be used as a noun. Do these refer to pop-up windows? -->


- Navigate to different pages without losing the email content.
- Minimize the email window to get back to the records you were working on.
- Expand the email editor pop-up window to see more email options.
- Simultaneously open three email compose pop-up windows.
- Search for and apply a predefined template to an email you're composing.
- Insert attachments to email.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> System administrators must enable the enhanced email experience before you can use it.

Compose an email using the enhanced experience:


<!--from editor: Please check the next sentence, which I restructured. -->


1. In the **Timeline** section of the account, contact, lead, or opportunity records, select **+** and then under **Activities**, select **Email**.


<!--from editor: Would it be OK and correct to say "A new email message opens."?-->

   An email pop-up opens. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Enhanced email pop-up](media/enhanced-email-pop-up.png "Enhanced email pop-up")

   The **From** and **To** fields are automatically populated based on the user and the account and contact of the original record.

2. Write your email from scratch or select **Insert Template** to search for and apply a template. 

3. Select **Attach file** if you want to add attachments.

4. Select **Insert signature** to search for and add your signature.

5. When you're done, select **Send**. 


<!--from editor: Does the following mean that if lower, you'll be taken to the standard email form instead of enhanced? -->


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The enhanced email pop-up window opens only when the height and width of your screen size is at least 600 x 840 pixels or greater. If lower, you will be taken to the email form from wherever you are in the app, and the context won't be preserved.

Deal manager is a dedicated workspace for sellers. As a seller, you can personalize the workspace depending on what you want to see in your workspace. You can organize opportunities in a way that makes sense to you, personalize your view, update information on the fly, add notes and tasks, and much more. You can also request your administrator to customize the experience further to improve your productivity.

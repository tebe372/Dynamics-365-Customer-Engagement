# Close an opportunity as won or lost (Sales and Sales Hub)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

If your customer has accepted your proposal, congratulations! However, whether your customer accepted or declined your proposal, it's now time to close that opportunity.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_sales_opportunities](../includes/proc-sales-opportunities.md)]  
   
   or

   If you're using the Sales Hub app, select the site map ![Site Map icon](media/site-map-icon.png "site map icon"), and then select **Opportunities**.
  
2. Select the opportunity you want to edit.  
  
3. At the top of the **Opportunity** form, do one of the following:  

   - To close your opportunity as won, select **Close as Won**.  
 
   - To close your opportunity as lost, select **Close as Lost**.

For information on how to resolve the common errors that you may get while you close an opportunity, see the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).

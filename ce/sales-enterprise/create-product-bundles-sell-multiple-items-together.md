# Create product bundles to sell multiple items together (Sales)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Encourage customers to buy more products instead of a single product by combining products in a bundle. Bundles replace the older kit functionality in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. Kits have been deprecated, so we recommend that you start using bundles instead.  
  
 These are the differences between kits and bundles:  
  
-   You can’t sell the products in a kit individually or separately, but you can mark certain products in a bundle as optional, and sell them individually.  
  
-   You can’t see individual products added in a kit when you create an opportunity or order, but you can see the products in a bundle.  
  
-   You can create nested kits (kits within a kit), but you can only add products to a bundle; you cannot add product families, kits, or other bundles to a bundle.  
  
 Similar to a kit, a bundle is a collection of products that is sold as single unit. Product bundling is useful in cases like:  
  
-   Pairing a top-selling product with a less popular product  
  
-   Grouping products in a way that customers get more benefit from the full line of products, for example Microsoft Office Suite or a digital camera with lenses

## Create a product bundle  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_mgr_vp_ceo_busmgr_sysadmin_syscust](../includes/proc-permissions-mgr-vp-ceo-busmgr-sysadmin-syscust.md)]  
  
    #### Check your security role  
  
    - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
    - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_prod_catalog](../includes/proc-settings-prod-catalog.md)]  
  
3.  Click **Families & Products**.  
  
4.  To add a standalone product bundle, click **Add Bundle**.  
  
     -OR-  
  
     To add product to an existing family, select the family in the list, and then click **Add Bundle**.  
  
5.  Enter information, noting any restrictions or requirements as needed.  
  
6. [!INCLUDE[proc_click_or_tap_save](../includes/proc-click-or-tap-save.md)]  
  
7.  In the **Bundle Products** section, click ![Add a record button](../sales-enterprise/media/add-recordbutton.gif "Add a record button"), and select products that you want to add to the bundle.  
  
     The **Product Association** page opens.  
  
8. [!INCLUDE[proc_handy_infotips](../includes/proc-handy-infotips.md)]  
  
    - **Bundle**. The bundle you’re adding the products to is selected by default.  
  
    - **Product**. Click the **Lookup** button and select a product you want to add to the bundle.  
  
    - **Quantity**. Specify the quantity of product you want to add to the bundle.  
  
    - **Required**. Specify whether this product is required or optional. If you select a product as optional, you can sell the bundle without the product.  
  
    - **Unit**. Select the unit in which you want to sell the product.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The **Valid From** and **Valid To** fields define the duration for which a product is valid. There’s no business logic associated with these fields except that the **Valid To** date must be later than the **Valid From** date. If required, you can implement your own business logic in these fields with a workflow, plug-in or [!INCLUDE[pn_sdk](../includes/pn-sdk.md)]. For example, run a scheduled job to automatically retire last season’s products using the date selected in the **Valid To** field.  
  
9. Click **Save and Close**.  
  
10. To change properties of an individual product in the bundle, click **Customize** corresponding to the product, and change the values as required.  
  
11. If you’ve added this bundle to a family, the bundle will inherit the properties from its parent family. To change the bundle’s property, open the property and click **Override**. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use properties to describe a product](../sales-enterprise/use-properties-describe-product.md)  
  
12. In the **Additional Details** section, click ![Add a record button](../sales-enterprise/media/add-recordbutton.gif "Add a record button"), and add a price list item. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create price lists and price list items to define pricing of products](../sales-enterprise/create-price-lists-price-list-items-define-pricing-products.md)  
  
13. In the **Product Relationships** section, click ![Add a record button](../sales-enterprise/media/add-recordbutton.gif "Add a record button"), and select a related product. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Define related products to increase chances of sales](../sales-enterprise/define-related-products-increase-chances-sales.md)

## Pricing of bundles  
 Typically, the pricing of products in bundles is different than the individual products. You can set a total and potentially discounted price for the bundle or if the bundle has optional products, add those products to the price list as price list items. Then the total for a bundle in an opportunity is calculated by adding up the prices for each price list item, including optional bundle products that your customer selects. If you don’t add an optional product in the price list, its price will be considered as zero.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  -   After you’re done adding all the details, click **Preview** on the command bar to look through the properties of the product bundle.  
> -   To create a new product bundle based on an existing one, on the command bar, click **Clone**. This opens a new product bundle record with the same information as the original product bundle record, except for the name and ID.

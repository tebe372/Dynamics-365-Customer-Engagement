# Predefined Security Roles for Sales

Security roles control a user's access to data through a set of access levels and permissions. The combination of access levels and permissions that are included in a specific security role defines  the user's access to data and the user's interactions with that data. For more information, see [Security roles and privileges](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges)

The predefined security roles for Sales include permissions and access levels that the default sales personas will need. For example, the Sales Manager and Salesperson security roles can be associated with the respective users in your organization. As a system administrator, you can verify the permissions and access levels granted for each role and modify it to suit your needs. For more information, see [Create or edit a security role](/power-platform/admin/create-edit-security-role).

## Assign Security Roles to a User

Associate one or more security roles to a user depending on their roles and responsibilities. For example, if a Sales Manager is also
responsible for enforcing best practices for Playbooks, assign the Sales Manager and Playbook Manager security roles to that user.

**Follow these steps:**

1. From the Sales Hub app, select the Settings icon in the top-right
   corner and select **Advanced Settings**.

2. Select **Settings** in the Business Management interface and
   navigate to **System, Security**.

3. Select **Users** and open the user account to which you want to
   assign the role.

4. Select **Manage Roles** and choose the roles that you want to assign to the user.

5. Notify the user and have them check their permissions.

# Enforce best practices with playbooks

Playbooks in Dynamics 365 for Sales provides guidance to the team members on actions to take on events such as a decision maker leaving the organization while they’re working with the decision maker on a deal. It also automates repetitive tasks and respond to external events. For example, playbook can automate the steps of renewing contracts or can define the tasks to do when a decision maker who a team member is working with on a deal leaves the organization.

To start with, anyone with a Playbook manager role or equivalent permissions creates playbook categories to classify the playbooks. Then, the playbook manager creates playbook templates that define a set of best practices based on the past experiences and their organization standards. Business users like a sales person or a service rep with the Playbook user role can then launch one of these playbook templates while they’re working on their records to ensure that best practices are applied consistently at every step.

**Note:**

The playbook capability is currently only available in the Sales Hub app in Dynamics 365 online.

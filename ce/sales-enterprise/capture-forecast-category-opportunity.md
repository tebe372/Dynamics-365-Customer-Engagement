# Capture forecast category for opportunity 

## Requirements
|  | |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise or Dynamics 365 Sales Premium <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator <br> See [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

You must select an option set while configuring the forecast to determine the confidence level of an opportunity as it moves along the path to conversion. For example, when you select the option set as **forecast categories**, the forecast grid displays the stages that are defined in the option set.

You can also manually configure your columns for a fully customized forecast. Forecast shows how many opportunities are in the pipeline and which of those are committed, delivering actionable insights. 

1.	In the site map, select **Opportunities**.

2.	In the list of opportunities, open an opportunity for which you want to capture the forecast category.

3.	In the **Forecast Category** drop-down list, select one of the following, and then select **Save**:

    -  **Pipeline**. The confidence of winning this opportunity is low. Any opportunity that a sales rep has just started to work on can be set to this category (this is the default value).

    -  **Best case**. The sales rep has started talking to customers or has shared quotes, and there is a moderate chance of winning the opportunity.

    -  **Committed**. The customer has committed to closing the deal.

    -  **Omitted**. To exclude an opportunityâ€™s numbers from the forecast. 
    
    - **Won**. If an opportunity is closed as won.
    
    - **Lost**. If an opportunity fails and is closed as lost.

The forecast category is used to determine the different confidence levels of an opportunity as it moves through the different stages before it is converted to a sale. This information is used in forecasting to indicate how many opportunities are committed versus how many are still in the pipeline so appropriate actions can be taken. 

**To capture the forecast category**

1.	Select the site map icon ![Icon to open site map](media/site-map-new.png "Icon to open site map"), and check the lower left corner in the site map to ensure that you are in the **Sales** area. Then, select **Opportunities**.

2.	In the list of opportunities, open an opportunity for which you want to capture the forecast category.

3.	In the **Forecast category** drop-down list, select one of the following, and then select **Save**:

    -  **Pipeline (low confidence).** Any opportunity that a sales rep has just started to work on can be set to this category. The confidence of winning this opportunity is low. This is the default value.

    -  **Best case (moderate confidence).** When the sales rep has started talking to customers or has shared quotes, and there are moderate chances of winning the opportunity, change the forecast category to **Best case (moderate confidence)**.

    -  **Committed (high confidence).** When the customer is positive and committed about closing the deal, change the category to **Committed (high confidence)**.

    -  **Omitted (exclude from forecast).** If you don’t want an opportunity’s numbers to be excluded from forecasting, use this category.

> [!TIP]
> You can create a workflow to change the forecast category based on changes in the business process stage or in the probability of an opportunity.

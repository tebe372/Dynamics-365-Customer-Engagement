# Allow adding products without associated price list

When adding products to opportunities, quotes, orders, or invoices, at times, salespeople need to specify the product prices ad hoc. You can allow salespeople to add products without associating a price list first.

To make price list optional while adding products

1.  In your app, on the nav bar, select the **Settings** icon, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

    The Business Management settings page opens in a new browser tab.

2.  On the nav bar, select **Settings**, and then select **Administration**.

3.  Select **System Settings**.

4.  In the **System Settings dialog** box, on the **Sales** tab, set the **Make
    price lists optional** field to **Yes**.

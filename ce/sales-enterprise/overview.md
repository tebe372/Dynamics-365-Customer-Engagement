Welcome to [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]! 

[!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] enables salespeople to build strong relationships with their customers, take actions based on insights, and close sales faster. Use [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] to keep track of your accounts and contacts, nurture your sales from lead to order, and create sales collateral. It also lets you create marketing lists and campaigns, and even follow service cases associated with specific accounts or opportunities.

## Different sales solutions for different business size

Dynamics 365 Sales is available in the following flavors [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] to suit the different business needs: 

- The Sales Hub app is built on the Unified Interface framework. The Unified Interface framework uses responsive web design principles to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience for any screen size, device, or orientation. The Sales Hub app is optimized to work on mobile devices as well as desktops. This app is available with the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise licensing plan. 

- The Sales Professional app is similar to the Sales Hub app, but the entities included in the Sales Professional app are a subset of the entities included in the Sales Enterprise. This app is available with the Dynamics 365 Sales Professional licensing plan. More information: [Overview of Dynamics 365 Sales Professional](../sales-professional/sales-professional-overview.md)

  > [!NOTE]
  > 
  > In addition to these, the new Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app (preview) is available. This app is optimized for core field seller scenarios to help sellers make use of the time that they spend on the road while traveling to meet customers. More information: [Overview of the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app](../sales-mobile/dynamics-365-sales-mobile-app).


## What Dynamics 365 Sales offers

[!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] offers great benefits, whether you're using a desktop, phone, or tablet.

### Benefits for salespeople

- Follow guided business processes, so you know which steps to take next to close deals faster. You can tailor these business processes for your organization's needs.

- Manage customers and deals wherever you are, on any device (phone, tablet, PC, or Mac).

- Get productive faster by using familiar tools. [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] is tightly integrated with [!include[Microsoft 365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] apps, which makes it easier to get going more quickly:

  - Use [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] to store and view documents like presentations or notes in the context of a record, such as an opportunity, so anyone working on the opportunity can view them. 
  
  - Open sales data in [!INCLUDE[pn-excel-short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)], make changes, and save the changes back to [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]&mdash;all without switching between applications. 
   
- Get actionable insights and suggestions based on how you work. For example, if you have an opportunity closing next week, the Relationship Assistant will send you a reminder to connect with your customer.

- Find all activities (appointments, phone calls, and so on) related to a customer or opportunity in one central place, so you have the context you need to do your job.

### Benefits for sales managers

- Accelerate your team's performance by using real-time analytics based on historical data and predictive information. 

- Monitor results, and provide feedback and coaching, in real time.

- Use immersive [!INCLUDE[pn-excel-short](../includes/pn-excel-short.md)] and prebuilt templates to do quick analysis without leaving [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)].

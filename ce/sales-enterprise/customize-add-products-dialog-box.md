As a system administrator, you can customize the Add products dialog box
to add information that helps your salespeople identify and select products quickly. You can either add more columns to the grid or add more details to the **Product** column. Attributes in the Product column help sellers get more information about the products *before* choosing a product. So, if you want to add a category or product ID to help distinguish between two products, add them to the
**Product** column. On the other hand, if *after* selecting a specific
product, the sellers should choose delivery priority (custom attribute),
add that attribute to the grid.

## Add or remove columns from the grid

By default, the Add products dialog displays the following columns in
the grid:

- Product name
- Unit
- Price per unit
- Quantity

 > [!NOTE]
 > The procedure below refers to the customization option available in the Sales Hub app. If you are using a custom app, access the following views from Power Apps:
> Opportunity products Add products
> Quote products Add products
> Order products Add products
> Invoice products Add products

For information on editing views, see [Choose and configure
columns in model-driven app
views](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/choose-and-configure-columns).

**To add or remove columns from the grid**

1. In the Sales Hub app, select the **Change area** icon ![Icon to change the work area](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") at the lower-left corner of the page and then select **App Settings**.  

2. Under **Product Catalog**, select **Product Catalog Settings**.  

3. Turn on the **Adding Products (preview)** option, if you haven't already.  
    You will see additional options to customize the Add products dialog for
    opportunity, quote, invoice, and order.  

4. Click the add products view of the entity that you want to customize. For example, click **Quote 'add products'** view to customize the Add products dialog for quotes.  
    You will be redirected to the corresponding view in Power Apps.

5. Click **+ View Column** and select the columns you want to add to the grid. Or, simply drag-and-drop the columns into the grid.

6. To remove a column, click the column in the grid and select **Remove**.

7. Click **Publish** to save and publish the customizations.
    The changes are applicable to the Add products dialog of the selected entity.

8. Open the entity that you customized. If you customized the add products view for quotes, open a quote and click **Add products**. Verify whether the customizations to the grid are reflected in the dialog.
    

## Add or edit attributes in the Product column

The **Product** column in the Add product dialog includes the product name and ID by default. You can customize the column to add other attributes to distinguish products better. For example, you can add the product category to differentiate products as shown in the screenshot below:

    The changes are applicable to the Add products dialog of opportunity, quote, order, and invoice.

7. To verify the changes, open an opportunity and click **Add products**.

## Customize the fields to search  

By default, the search field in the Add products dialog searches the product name, ID, and description. You can expand the search to include other text-based fields too. For example, you can add the hierarchy path field to the search scope.

**To customize the fields to search:**

1. Open Power Apps and navigate to **Tables** in the left pane.

2. Search for the **Product** entity and open it.

3. Click **Views** and open the **Quick Find All Products** view. 

4. In the right pane, go to the **Find by** section and click **Edit find table columns**. Select the fields you want to include in search.
    > [!NOTE] Select only the text-based fields.

3. Click **Publish** to save and publish changes to the view.
    The changes are applicable to the product search in the Add products dialog of opportunity, quote, order, and invoice.

4. To verify the changes, open an opportunity and click **Add products**.

5. Search for a keyword and verify if the search is returning matches from the newly added fields.

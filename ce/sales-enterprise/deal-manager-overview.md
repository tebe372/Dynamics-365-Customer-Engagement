Deal manager is a dedicated workspace for sellers that can be personalized and customized depending on what sellers want to see in their workspace. Sellers can,

- Organize opportunities in a way that works for them
- Personalize their views
- Update information on the fly
- Add notes and tasks, and much more. 

As an administrator, you can customize the experience for sellers to further improve their productivity.

- Personalize their views
- Update information on the fly
- Add notes and tasks, and much more. 

> [!NOTE]
> This release has a few limitations related to chart customization. For more information, see the deal manager section in the [Known issues](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2171768) document.

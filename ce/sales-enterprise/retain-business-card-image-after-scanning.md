# Enable or disable saving of business card image

By default, any business card that is scanned is stored as an image and associated with the **Lead** or **Contact** record. A system administrator can configure this option to enable or disable this setting.

To enable or disable saving of a business card image:

1.  In your app, select the **Settings** icon, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Advanced Settings option on the Settings menu](media/advanced-settings-option.png "Advanced Settings option on the Settings menu")

    The **Business Management** page opens.

2. On the navigation bar, select **Settings**, and then under **System**, select **Administration**.

3. Select **System Settings**.

4. On the **Sales** tab, set the **Always retain business card images after scanning option** to **Yes** or **No** depending on whether your organization wants to save and associate the business card images with the contact or lead record. 

5. Select **OK**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the April 2020 release, this setting is also available in the **App Settings** area of the Sales Hub app itself. To go to this setting:
> 1. At the bottom of the site map, select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") and then select **App Settings**. 
> 2. In the site map, select **Overview**, and on the **Overview** page, select **Manage** for **A quick, easy way to capture business card info**.

# Preview: Insert an email template

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can use an email template—a preformatted email message—to quickly create and send email messages. You can insert an email template while composing an email by selecting Insert Template on the command bar. The list of available templates is displayed in the Email templates window. In the Recently used section, the four most recently used templates are displayed. The All templates section displays a list of all out-of-the-box email templates in the alphabetical order. If you have created a custom email template, they will also be available here. For information on creating a custom email template, see [Create templates for email](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-templates-email).

You can either search for a template or browse through the list and select it. When you select an email template, the preview is displayed on the right-side of the window. The preview allows you to see the content and pick the right template for the email. 

After inserting an email template, you can modify the content as per the requirement, and then send the email.

To insert an email template:

1.	In the email editor, select **Insert Template** on the command bar.

2.	In the **Email templates** window, browse for the required template. After finding the required template, select it and preview the content of the template.

3.	Optionally, select the down arrow on the template's name to see its description.

4.	Select **Apply template** to insert the content in the email.

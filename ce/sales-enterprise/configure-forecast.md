# Configure forecasts in your organization

A forecast helps your organization predict how much revenue your sales team will generate in a given timeframe. When done correctly, forecasting can play a significant role in your company's success. By using a forecast:

- Sellers can track performance against their targets and identify pipeline risks that might jeopardize their ability to hit their targets.

- Managers can track individual sales performance against quotas to proactively provide coaching.

- Directors can use forecast trends to anticipate departmental sales and reallocate resources if necessary.

- Organization leaders can use the projected estimates to change the product strategy or convey updated projections to investors.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Forecasting is not available on Government Community Cloud (GCC).  

As an administrator or forecast manager, you can configure forecasts in your organization. You can define the type of forecast, its hierarchy, permissions for accessing it, and the details you want to appear on the forecast grid. After a forecast is activated, your sales team can view the revenue and pipeline projections.

By default, forecasting is available in your organhization and the following page is displayed when you select **Forecast configuration**:

> ![Forecasting is enabled](media/forecast-enable-forecasting-enabled.png "Forecasting is enabled") 

Also, the following changes appear in the **Sales Hub** app:

-	**Forecasts** appears under **Performance** in the **Sales** site map.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Forecasts option in sales site map](media/forecast-select-sales-performance-forecasts.png "Forecasts option in the Sales site map")
 
-	**Forecast category** appears on the **Opportunity** form. The categories define the confidence level of closing an opportunity. If necessary, you can add custom values specifically defined for your organization. To learn more, see [Capture forecast category for opportunity](capture-forecast-category-opportunity.md).

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Forecast category option in opportunity form](media/capture-forecast-category-opportunity-form.png "Forecast category in an opportunity form")

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Forecast category** options consists of **Won** and **Lost** opportunity statuses. If an opportunity is set as **Won** or **Lost**, the forecast category automatically changes status through the **Opportunity Forecast Category Mapping Process** out-of-the-box workflow. <br>
    > To view the **Opportunity Forecast Category Mapping Process** workflow, go to **Settings** > **Process Center** > **Processes** and select **All Processes** view. Search and open the **Opportunity Forecast Category Mapping Process** workflow. You can customize or deactivate the workflow according to your organization's requirements. <br>
    > If you're using a custom option set instead of forecast category, you must create a workflow to automatically sync the opportunity status with your option set to ensure that the forecast is projecting accurate values. <br> 
    >  To learn more, see [Use Workflow processes to automate processes that don't require user interaction](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/customize/workflow-processes).

# Configure forecasts in your organization

A forecast helps your organization predict how much revenue your sales team will generate in a given timeframe. When done correctly, forecasting can play a significant role in your company's success. By using a forecast:

- Sellers can track performance against their targets and identify pipeline risks that might jeopardize their ability to hit their targets.

- Managers can track individual sales performance against quotas to proactively provide coaching.

- Directors can use forecast trends to anticipate departmental sales and reallocate resources if necessary.

- Organization leaders can use the projected estimates to change the product strategy or convey updated projections to investors.

As an administrator or forecast manager, you can configure forecasts in your organization. You can define the type of forecast, its hierarchy, permissions for accessing it, and the details you want to appear on the forecast grid. After a forecast is activated, your sales team can view the revenue and pipeline projections.

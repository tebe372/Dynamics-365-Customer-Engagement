# Configure a forecast in your organization

A forecast helps your organization predict how much revenue your sales team will generate in a given timeframe. When done correctly, it can play a significant role in your company's success. Using a forecast:

- Sellers can track performance against their targets and identify pipeline risks that could jeopardize the ability to hit the targets.

- Managers can track individual sales performance against quotas to pro-actively provide coaching.

- Directors can use the forecast trends to anticipate departmental sales and reallocate resources.

- Organization leaders can use the projected estimates to change the product strategy or convey updated projections to investors.

As an administrator or forecast manager, you can configure forecasts in your organization. By configuring forecast, you define the type of forecast, hierarchy, permissions, and details to appear on the forecast grid. Once a forecast is activated, your sales team can view the revenue and pipeline projections.

To configure a forecast, follow these steps:

1.	[Review prerequisites](#review-prerequisites)

2.	[Enable forecasting](enable-forecast.md)

3.	[Select a template](select-template-forecast.md)

4.	[Define general properties and scheduling](define-general-properties-scheduling-forecast.md)

5.	[Provide permissions](provide-permissions-forecast.md)

6.	[Choose layout and columns](choose-layout-and-columns-forecast.md)

7.	[Activate and upload simple columns data](activate-upload-simple-columns-data-forecast.md)


## Review prerequisites

Verify the following prerequisites before configuring a forecast:

-	You’re assigned the **Administrator** or **Forecast manager** role. The **Forecast manager** role is created specifically to configure forecast. Using this role, you can:

    -	Create, assign, and edit forecast configurations for your organization.

    -	Delete, activate, and deactivate forecast configurations that are defined for your organization.

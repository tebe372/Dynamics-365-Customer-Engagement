## Frequently asked questions

**Are custom fields on forms available offline?**

Yes, custom fields of all types are available to use offline. For lookup fields, only downloaded records can be referenced.

## Known issues

-	**Business Process Flows**: Business process flows are not supported for mobile offline. When you are offline, business process flows grids and views will not be available and rendered on records that are opened in offline mode. If a record containing a business process flow was loaded prior to going offline, business process flow functions, such as move next or move previous will not work. Business process flows support the ability to branch to a different set of stages, based on conditions defined on fields of the record. In offline mode, these conditions to determine the next set of stages in the business process flows will not be evaluated.

-	**Qualify a lead**: When a lead created in mobile offline is qualified and when you go online, the business process stage will still show the qualify stage. You will have to manually select **Next stage** to move the lead to next stage.

-	**Views**: Views are not supported for the following entities in offline mode:
    -	Email
    -	Task
    -	Appointment
    -	Phonecall
    
    Any views that have linked entities (related entity) that are not available offline are also not supported.

-	Adding stakeholders, competitors, and sales team to opportunities is not supported in offline mode.

-	Product suggestions (when adding product lines to opportunities, quotes, orders, or invoices) are not supported in offline mode.

- Product property related entities (DynamicProperty, DynamicPropertyInstance, DynamicPropertyOptionSetItem, and ProductSubstitute) are not enabled for offline out of the box. These entities must be enabled for offline and added to an offline profile if product properties are to be used in offline mode.

# Sales Team Member app for users with Team Member license

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The new Sales Team Member app is designed for the lightweight sales scenarios where users don’t need the full capabilities of an enterprise application. This app comes with the Team member license. 

During the early access phase of the Team Member license enforcement, users with Team Member licenses can use the designated app modules alongside all existing apps.

The designated app modules are:

- Customer Service Team Member 
- Sales Team Member
- Project Resource Hub

After the license enforcement is turned on (starting April 1, 2020), users won't have access to unentitled apps such as Customer Service Hub, Sales Hub, and custom apps. 

At a high level, users with the Team Member license can do the following tasks in the Sales Team Member app:

-  Customer management. Work with accounts and contacts
-  Lead and opportunity management. See leads or opportunities linked with the accounts or contacts or see other sales-related data
-  Add activities such as notes

For more information on the use rights for the Team Member license, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544).

## Access the Sales Team Member app

1. Go to home.dynamics.com. You’ll see the team member apps you’ve access to. Open the one you want to work on.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Sales Team Member app](media/sales-team-member-app.png "Sales Team Member app")
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > During the early access phase, the Sales Team Member app is shown on the Dynamics 365 home page only if you already have the Sales Hub installed. If you don’t see the Sales Team Member app, you can get it from Microsoft AppSource.
    
2. When you open the app, in the site map, you will see the entities available in the app.

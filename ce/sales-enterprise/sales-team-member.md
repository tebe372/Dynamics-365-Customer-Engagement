# Sales Team Member app for users with Team Member license

[!INCLUDE [cc-early-access-2020w1](../includes/cc-early-access-2020w1.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The new Sales Team Member app is designed for the lightweight sales scenarios where users don't need the full capabilities of an enterprise application. This app is included with the Team Member license. 

During the early access phase of the Team Member license enforcement, users with the Team Member license can use the designated app modules alongside all existing apps.

The designated app modules are:

- Customer Service Team Member
- Sales Team Member
- Project Resource Hub

At a high level, users with the Team Member license can perform the following tasks in the Sales Team Member app:

-  Customer management: work with accounts and contacts.
-  Lead and opportunity management: see leads or opportunities linked with accounts or contacts, or see other sales-related data.
-  Add activities, such as notes.

For more information about the user rights for the Team Member license, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544).

## Access the Sales Team Member app

Users with the Team Member license can go to home.dynamics.com. They'll see the team member apps they've access to.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - During the early access phase, the Sales Team Member app is shown for a user on the Dynamics 365 home page only if they have the Sales Hub installed. If the Sales Team Member app isn't available on the Dynamics 365 home page, they can get it from Microsoft AppSource.
> - You must assign the Sales Team Member role to the users who will access the app. To learn about assigning the role, see [Assign a security roles to a user](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles) in the Power Platform documentation.
    
When users open the app, in the site map, they'll see the entities available in the Sales Team Member app.

# Sales Team Member app for users with Team Member license

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The new Sales Team Member app is designed for the lightweight sales scenarios where users don't need the full capabilities of an enterprise application. This app is included<!--note from editor: Edit okay?--> with the Team Member license. 

During the early access phase of the Team Member license enforcement, users with the Team Member license can use the designated app modules alongside all existing apps.

The designated app modules are:

- Customer Service Team Member
- Sales Team Member
- Project Resource Hub

At a high level, users with the Team Member license can perform the following tasks in the Sales Team Member app:

-  Customer management: work with accounts and contacts.
-  Lead and opportunity management: see leads or opportunities linked with accounts or contacts, or see other sales-related data.
-  Add activities, such as notes.

For more information about the user rights for the Team Member license, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544).

## Access the Sales Team Member app

1. Go to home.dynamics.com. You'll see the Team Member apps you have access to. Open the one you want to work on.

    > ![Sales Team Member app](media/sales-team-member-app.png "Sales Team Member app")
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > During the early access phase, the Sales Team Member app is shown on the Dynamics 365 home page only if you already have the Sales Hub installed. If you don't see the Sales Team Member app, you can get it from Microsoft AppSource.
    
2. When you open the app, in the site map, you'll see the entities available in the app.

<!--note from editor: I'm not sure if the "you" in the procedure above is the same "you" this Important note is addressed to? It doesn't seem to be the same audience.-->
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Give users access to the Sales Team Member app. The Sales CS Team Member role gives access to the Sales Team Member app. Customers can reuse this role or use custom roles.

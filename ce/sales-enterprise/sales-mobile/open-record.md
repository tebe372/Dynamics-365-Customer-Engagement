# Open a record

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can open a record from the home page by tapping an item in the **Recent contacts** or **Recent records** section. Similarly, you can tap a record in search results to open the record.

The record is opened in the compact view. The compact form shows important details about the record along with any notes, reminders, or insights.

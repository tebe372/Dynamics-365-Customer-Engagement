# Manage records

Records and regarding entities can be accessed from the home page or the Meetings page.

- On the home page, go to the **Recent records** section.   
- On the Meetings page, go to the **Regarding** section.   

You can [view details](#view-details), [create new records](#create-records-and-activities), and [edit records](#edit-records-and-entities) on the home and Meetings pages. Additionally, you can [change a regarding entity](view-agenda.md#change-regarding-entity) and [add a regarding entity](view-agenda.md#add-regarding-entity) on the Meetings page.

## View details

> [!NOTE]
> - The fields that you see on the compact form are defined in the quick view form of the entity.
> - The lightweight view doesn't include all attributes of the entity.
> - This is a lightweight form that contains any attributes defined in the first form on quick view form set order. More information: [Set the form order](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/control-access-forms#set-the-form-order)

You can view the details of records in the following ways: 

**On the home page**    

The home page displays a list of records that you have recently accessed. These records include opportunities, leads, contacts, quotes, accounts, and notes. When you tap the record, the record opens in a lightweight form. This form provides the basic details, including [related notes and reminders](#notes-and-reminders). 

**On the Meetings page**     

The Meeting details page displays the regarding entity that is related to the meeting. Also, the notes and insights that are displayed in the meeting are related to the displayed regarding entity. Tap **Open *record type*** to view the details in the lightweight form. The details include basic information about the entity, [related notes, and reminders](#notes-and-reminders).

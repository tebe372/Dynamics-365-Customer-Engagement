# Modify quick view forms

The Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app uses the quick view form to display table details. This is a lightweight form that doesn't include all attributes of the table. More information: [Create a quick view form](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-quick-view-forms)

If you've created multiple quick view forms, the mobile app uses the first form in the quick view form order. In the following example, three quick view forms were created for the **Contacts** table with the form order as shown.

|Form order|Form name|
|----------|---------|
|1|Contact quick view form one|
|2|Contact quick view form two|
|3|Contact quick view form three|
|||

In this example, the mobile app displays information based on the fields defined in **Contact quick view form one**.

If you want to change the fields that the mobile app displays, modify the first quick view form in the form order. If you want a different quick view form to be used for displaying information, move that form to the top of the form order.

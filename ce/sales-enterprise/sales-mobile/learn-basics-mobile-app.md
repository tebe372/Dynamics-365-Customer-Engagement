### Reminders and insights

Shows action cards from the relationship assistant. The cards show up to five reminders and five insights. If your administrator has created custom cards, they can be shown here, too.

Insight cards help keep you up to date with your work in Dynamics 365 Sales, letting you know when you need to follow up on an email, attend a meeting, and much more. The cards are generated by the assistant based on data stored in Dynamics 365 Sales and your Exchange inbox and calendar. More information: [Insight cards reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/ai/sales/action-cards-reference).   

>[!NOTE]
>Not all types of insights and reminders cards are displayed in this section.

When you select **Reminders** or **Insights**, an extended list appears. Tap a reminder or an insight to see details about it. Tap **Open** in the card to open the reminder or the insight card.

Tap ![Options button](media/sm-options-button.png "Options button") to take further action on a reminder, such as dismiss, snooze, or mark it as helpful or not helpful.

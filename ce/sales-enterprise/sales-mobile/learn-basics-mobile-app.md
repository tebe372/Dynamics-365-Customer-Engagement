## Reminders and insights

The Reminders and Insights sections on the home page show action cards from the relationship assistant. The cards show up to three reminders and three insights. If your administrator has created custom cards, they can be shown here, too.

Insight cards help keep you up to date with your work in Dynamics 365 Sales, letting you know when you need to follow up on an email, attend a meeting, and much more. The cards are generated by the assistant based on data stored in Dynamics 365 Sales and your Exchange inbox and calendar.

>[!NOTE]

When you tap **Reminders** or **Insights**, an extended list appears. Tap a reminder or an insight to see details about it. Tap **Open** in the card to open the reminder or the insight card.

### Reminders and insights

Insight cards help keep you up to date with your work in Dynamics 365 Sales, letting you know when you need to follow-up on an email, attend a meeting, and much more. The cards are generated by the assistant based on data stored in Dynamics 365 Sales and your Exchange inbox and calendar.

Tap ![Options button](media/sm-options-button.png "Options button") to take further action on a reminder, such as dismiss, snooze, or mark it as helpful or not helpful.

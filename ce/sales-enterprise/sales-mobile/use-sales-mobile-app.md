# Use the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

With the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app, you'll be able to quickly:

-   Plan your day:<!--note from editor: Edit suggested, to avoid the awkward phrasing "you'll be able to quickly plan your day better." If you don't like it, how about "Better plan your day".-->

    -   View your agenda and upcoming meetings.

    -   View reminders and insights.

-   Take actions after a meeting.

-   Find and act on records.

The home page shows items that are most relevant to you, such as:

-   Your upcoming meetings.

-   Your recent contacts and other records.

-   Reminders.

-   Insights.

## Get familiar with the home page
<!--note from editor: If you don't like the edit to the H2, it should be "Familiarize yourself with the home page." -->
The home page gives you a quick access to what's most important to you. The home page is divided into the following sections.<!--note from editor: Removed the colon because they're great for introducing lists, but not tables or headings.-->

### Meetings

This section shows important information about the last meeting you were in and the next one coming up for the day.<!--note from editor: --> More information: [View agenda](view-agenda.md)

![Meetings displayed on the home screen](media/sm-meetings-home.png "Meetings displayed on the home screen")

### Recent contacts

Use **Recent contacts** to open an extended list of the contacts you've recently accessed. You can tap a contact to view its details.

### Recent records

Select **Recent records** to view an extended list of the records you've worked on recently, such as an account or opportunity. You can tap a record to view its details. More information: [Open a record](open-record.md)

### Reminders and insights

Shows action cards from the relationship assistant. The cards show up to five reminders and five insights. If your administrator has created custom cards, they can be shown here, too.

When you select **Reminders** or **Insights**, an extended list appears. Tap a reminder or an insight to see details about it. Tap **Open** in the card to open the reminder or the insight card.

Select **More** (**...**)<!--note from editor: Edit okay? Or do you mean the Options button here?--> to take further action on a reminder, such as dismiss, snooze, or mark it as helpful or not helpful.

## Navigate through the app

You can use the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen<!--note from editor: I've used this phrasing because "bottom navigation bar" seems a bit ambiguous, implies that there's at lease one other navigation bar. Also, you simply use "navigation bar" in at least one other article, so it seems like this qualification really only needs to be made once in these articles.--> to navigate through the app.

From anywhere in the app:

-   Tap **Home** to go to the home page.

-   Tap **Search** to search for records.

-   Tap **Meetings** to go to the calendar view.

-   Tap **More** to open items in Unified Interface.

# Create a contact

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can create a contact from the home page or from the list of meeting attendees. You can create a contact from the attendee list only if the attendee isn't already a contact in your Dynamics 365 organization.<!--note from editor: Edit okay? In view-agenda.md, you said this applies to a contact who is "not a record stored in Dynamics 365 Sales." Should that phrase be used here also?-->

**To create a contact from the attendee list for a meeting**

1.  In the attendee list for a meeting, tap the name of the attendee.

**To create a contact from the home page**

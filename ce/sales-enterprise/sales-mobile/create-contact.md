# Manage contacts

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app, you can view, edit, and create contacts.<!-- Edit note: Removed most of the creation details, moved some notes below. -->

- [View details of a contact](#view-details-of-a-contact)

- [Edit contact details](#edit-contact-details)

- [Create contact](#create-contact)

## View details of a contact

Tap a contact on the home page or on the Meetings<!-- Edit note: Meeting or Meetings. --> page to view the details of the contact in a quick view form. To open the contact in the Sales Hub app, tap **Open Contact**. In the following example, the details of a recent contact shown on the home page are displayed in a quick view form:   

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open contact details](media/sm-open-contact.png "Open contact details") 

## Edit contact details

If the contact already exists in your Dynamics 365 Sales organization, you can update the contact details, such as mobile number and business email, by using the Edit option in the quick edit form.   

1. Tap **Edit** in the upper-right corner of the screen. The contact's quick edit form opens.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Quick view form of contact](media/sm-contact-quick-view.png "Quick view form of contact")
    
2. Enter or update the required information, and then tap **Save**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Edit contact details](media/sm-contact-edit.png "Edit contact details")   

## Create contact

If you need to create a contact that doesn't already exist in your Dynamics 365 Sales organization, you can use the mobile app to create the contact from the following pages:

- [Home page](#home-page)

- [Meetings page](#meetings-page)

### Home page

3.  In the **Create a contact** form, fill in the details, and then tap **Save**.

### Meetings page

    ![Tap an attendee name](media/sm-tap-attendee.png "Tap an attendee name")
    
1. Tap **Create contact**. The **Create a contact** form opens.<!-- Edit note: Looks like the border code below is showing up in the topic. Also, had duplicate steps here. -->

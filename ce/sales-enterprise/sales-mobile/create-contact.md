# Create a contact

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Contact can be created from a Meeting attendee list or from the home page:

-   In the Meeting attendee list, if there's a participant who is not a Dynamics 365 contact, you will see a **Create a contact** link. Tap the link to create a contact record in Dynamics 365.

-   To create a contact from the home page, select the Plus icon ![Plus icon](media/sm-plus-icon.png "Plus icon") from the bottom navigation bar, and then select **Add a contact**.

The Create a contact form opens.

Fill in the details, and tap **Save**. Alternately, tap on **Scan a business card** to create a contact from a scanned business card.

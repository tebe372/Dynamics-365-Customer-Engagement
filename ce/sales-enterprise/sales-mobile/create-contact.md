# Manage contacts

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can easily add a contact to Dynamics 365 by using a lightweight experience. The contact can be created by tapping ![Plus icon](media/sm-plus-icon.png "Plus icon") on the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen or from an attendee of a meeting. You can create a contact from an attendee only if the attendee isn't already a contact in your Dynamics 365 organization. You can do the following action on contacts:   
- [View details of a contact](#view-details-of-a-contact)  
- [Edit contact details](#edit-contact-details)   
- [Create contact](#create-contact)  

## View details of a contact

Tap the contact on the home page or on the meeting page to view the details of contact in quick view form. Further, tap **Open Contact** to open the contact in the **Contact** form in Sales Hub app.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open contact details](media/sm-open-contact.png "Open contact details")

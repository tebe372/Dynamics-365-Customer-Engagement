# Overview of Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Mobile apps help sellers build great customer relationship, stay up-to-date with important information, and helps them respond to their customers faster. The new Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app (preview) is optimized for core field seller scenarios to help sellers make use of the time that they spend on the road while travelling to meet customers. It helps sellers with the right data anywhere anytime and lets them log and share information quickly.

In contrast to the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app, which is a model-driven app that you use to open any Customer Engagement app like Sales Hub or Customer Service Hub on mobile, the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app is specifically designed for core sales scenarios.

With the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app, you can do the following and much more:

-   Plan your day: Before you start your day, you would certainly want to see what's lined up for the day. You could quickly see your customer meetings reminders or insights for the day.

-   Post meeting work: After you're out of a meeting, you can quickly add notes, create contacts, or update data in relevant records.

-   Find required information and act accordingly: Find a contact you want to reach out to with ease or find the recent records you worked on.

This app is available for download on the app stores of iOS and Android devices.

# Overview of the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Mobile apps help sellers build great customer relationships, stay up-to-date with important information, and respond to their customers faster. The new Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app (preview) is optimized for core field seller scenarios to help sellers make use of the time that they spend on the road while traveling to meet customers. It helps sellers with the right data anywhere, anytime, and lets them log and share information quickly.

With the impact COVID-19 has had on the modern workplace, the need for mobile access to Dynamics 365 for Sales is no longer limited to on-the-go sellers, so we’ve taken up the challenge of creating a modern app that’s optimized for field sellers&mdash;whether they’re working from their car, from the office, or from their sofa.  

In contrast to the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app, which is a model-driven app that you use to open any customer engagement app like Sales Hub or Customer Service Hub on mobile, the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app is specifically designed for core sales scenarios.

With the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app, you can do the following (and much more):

- Plan your day: Before you start your day, you want to see what it has in store. You can immediately see reminders about your customer meetings or insights for the day.

- Do post-meeting work: After you're out of a meeting, you can quickly add notes, create contacts, and update data in relevant records.

- Find required information and act accordingly: Find a contact you want to reach out to with ease, or find the recent records you worked on.

The Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app can be installed on [iOS](install-ios-app.md) and [Android](install-android-app.md).

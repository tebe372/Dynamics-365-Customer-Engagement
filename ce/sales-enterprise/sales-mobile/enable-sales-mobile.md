# Enable the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app is an intuitive mobile experience that offers quick access to customer information and makes it easy to keep this information current. This simplifies customer relationship management and helps sellers focus on selling. 

With the impact COVID-19 has had on the modern workplace, the need for mobile access to CRM is no longer limited to on-the-go sellers, so we’ve taken up the challenge of creating a modern app that’s optimized for field sellers and inside sellers alike—whether they’re working from their car, from the office, or from their sofa.  

Field sellers spend a lot of time on the road, traveling to meet customers. "On-the-go" time can become productive time with this mobile app, which is available on iOS and Android.

Before field sellers can use the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app, you must enable it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - For the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app to work, you must enable relevance search for the environment in which you enable the mobile app. More information: [Configure relevance search to improve search results and performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization)
> - To set a regarding record for a meeting, you must enable server-side synchronization in your environment. More information: [Server-side synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/server-side-synchronization)

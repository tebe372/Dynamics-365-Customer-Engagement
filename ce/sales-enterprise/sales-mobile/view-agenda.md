The meeting information section provides information about the meeting subject, location, time, and description. Tap the description section to show more details. Note that the meeting information can be viewed but cannot be edited in the app.

**Attendees**

Up to five meeting attendees are shown in the Attendees section, such as customers and the meeting organizer. You can see attendee acceptance status, such as accepted, tentative, declined, or no response. When you tap the name of an attendee, the quick view of their contact record opens.

### Regarding entity, notes, and reminders

>[!NOTE]
> The data that is displayed is related to the selected regarding entity and retrieved from your Dynamics 365 Sales organization.

#### Regarding entity

The Regarding section or entity specifies what the meeting is about, such as an opportunity, lead, contact, or account. When a meeting is attached to an entity, the meeting displays the timeline, insight, participant information, and corresponding related entities. Also, the regarding entity helps you to understand what the meeting is about, so you can come prepared with relevant information.

In the following screenshot, you can see that the meeting is about an opportunity to purchase 10,000 cars.

# Create or edit quotes (Sales and Sales Hub)

One way that can help you increase your sales is to add all products that your customer might need to your quote. [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] may also offer product bundles or product families to make it easier for you to choose products for upsell and cross-sell.  
  
 Most sales begin with a price quote, which eventually becomes an order.  
  
 You'll probably edit a quote multiple times as a sale progresses. Initially, you create a draft, and then you need to activate it when it's ready to go to a customer.  
  
 When the customer accepts the quote, you create an order. Otherwise, you close the quote as revised, canceled, or lost.  
  
## Create a quote from an opportunity (Sales Hub)

1.	Select the site map  ![Site Map icon](media/site-map-icon.png "site map icon"), and then select **Opportunities**.

2.	Select the opportunity you want to create a quote for.

3.	On the **Quotes** tab, select **Add New Quote**.

    The quote form opens. The quote form is prefilled with important details from the opportunity record.

4.	Enter shipping and payment information in the **Shipping Information** area of the **Quote** form.

5.	Enter the billing and shipping addresses in the **Addresses** area of the **Quote** form.

6.	To add products from your opportunity to your quote, on the command bar of the **Quote** form, select **Get Products**. Add more products or remove existing ones from the **Products** area.

7.	Select **Save** in the lower-right corner of the screen.

8.	When your quote is ready to send to your customer, on the command bar, select **Activate Quote**.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Your base record and all its line items must use the same currency. For example, if your quote has the currency set to U.S Dollars, you must use the same currency for the price list items that you add to the quote. You canâ€™t change the currency of the base record (in this case, an quote), unless you remove all the line items associated with the record.
> Similarly, if the quote is created from an opportunity, it must use the same currency as the opportunity.

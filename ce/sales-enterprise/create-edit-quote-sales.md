# Create or edit a quote (Sales and Sales Hub)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

One way you might increase your sales is to add all products that your customer might need to your quote. Your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] system might offer product bundles or product families to make it easier for you to choose products for upsell and cross-sell.  
  
 Most sales begin with a price quote, which eventually becomes an order.  
  
 You'll probably edit a quote multiple times as a sale progresses. Initially, you create a draft, and then you need to activate it when it's ready to go to a customer.  
  
 When the customer accepts the quote, you create an order. Otherwise, you close the quote as revised, canceled, or lost.

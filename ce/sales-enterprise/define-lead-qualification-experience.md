# Define lead qualification experience

Give your salespeople the flexibility to choose which records to create—account, contact, or opportunity—when a lead is qualified. 

To define the experience: 

1.	In the Sales app, select the **Settings** icon, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

2.	Select **Settings**, then **Administration**, and then **System Settings**.

3.	Select the **Sales** tab.

4.	Under **Qualify lead experience**, set **Create Account, Contact, and Opportunity records by default upon qualifying a lead** to **No**.

This prompts salespeople to select which record types to be created once a lead is qualified. 

If you set **Create Account, Contact, and Opportunity records by default upon qualifying a lead** to **Yes**, Account, Contact, and Opportunity records are created by default. 

This behavior is applicable on all the leads that are qualified after this setting is updated.

Define lead qualification experience

Give your salespeople the flexibility to choose which records to create—account, contact, or opportunity—when a lead is qualified. 
To define the experience, 

1.	In the sales app, select the Settings icon , and the select Advanced Settings.

2.	Select **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings**.

3.	Select the Sales tab.

4.	Under Qualify lead experience, set **Create Account, Contact, and Opportunity records by default upon qualifying a lead** to **No**.

This prompts salespeople to select which record types to be created once a lead is qualified. 

If you set **Create Account, Contact, and Opportunity records by default upon qualifying a lead** to **Yes**, Account, Contact, and Opportunity records are created by default. 

This behavior is applicable on all the leads that are qualified after this setting is updated.

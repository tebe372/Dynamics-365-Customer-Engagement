# Create a quick campaign using in-app marketing (Sales)

Send an e-mail blast to customers who fit a specific demographic, a mail campaign to clients in a specific region, or perhaps a phone call campaign to previous buyers of a particular product by using a quick campaign in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]. A quick campaign is a single campaign activity geared toward a targeted audience. Track the success of your quick campaign through campaign responses, and convert the positive responses into new leads, quotes, orders, or opportunities.  
  
 ![Quick campaign wizard](../sales-enterprise/media/quick-campaign-wizard.png "Quick campaign wizard")  
  
 If you need to perform more than one activity for your campaign, such as an email blast and a mailing, create a new campaign instead. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create or edit a campaign using in-app marketing](../sales-enterprise/create-edit-campaign-using-app-marketing-sales.md)  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_marketing_marketing_lists](../includes/proc-marketing-marketing-lists.md)]  
  
2. Open a record, and then in the **Quick Campaigns** area, click the **Add** button ![Add button](../sales-enterprise/media/add-button.PNG "Add button").  
  
3. In the Quick Campaign Wizard, read the instructions on the Welcome page, and click **Next**.  
  
4. Specify a name for the quick campaign.  
  
5. Select the type of activity you want to create.  
  
    You can also select who you want [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] to assign the activity to and whether [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] should perform the activity automatically for appropriate activities, such as sending email messages. For example, if you are creating a phone call activity for all the sales representatives, you can select the phone call activity, and then select **The owners of the records that are included in the quick campaign**. Each sales representative can then see the activity and take action on it. However, if you are creating a large number of email activities that [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] will perform automatically, you can assign the email activity to yourself instead of the record owners.  
  
6. Add or change information in the text boxes in the activity form, and click **Next**.  
  
7. Click **Create**.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  You can't add records to a quick campaign after you create it.

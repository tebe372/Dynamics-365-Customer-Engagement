    ![Icon to change the work area](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area")
    in the lower-left corner and then select **App Settings**. 
1. Under **General Settings**, select **Deal manager (preview)**.
1. Select the level of access you want to grant under **Define team access**.
    - Select **All security roles** to grant access to all users.
    - Select **Specific security roles** and add the security roles that you want to grant access to.
1. Select **Publish**.
   The deal manager workspace is now available to the selected roles. See how to [access deal manager workspace](access-deal-manager.md).

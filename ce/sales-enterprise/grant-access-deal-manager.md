1. Under **General Settings**, select **Deal manager (preview)**.
1. Under **Define team access**, select one of the following:
    - Select **All security roles** to grant access to all users.
    - Select **Specific security roles**, and then add the security roles that you want to grant access to.
1. Select **Publish**.

The deal manager workspace is now available to the selected roles. More information: [Access the deal manager workspace](access-deal-manager.md)

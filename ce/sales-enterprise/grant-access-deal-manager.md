# Grant access to deal manager (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A preview is a feature that is not complete, but is made available to you before general availability so you can evaluate the preview and provide feedback to Microsoft. Previews may have restricted functionality and may employ reduced or different privacy, security, or compliance commitments than a commercial version. As such, previews are not intended for production use, which means they are not meant for "live" Customer Data, Personal Data, or other data that is subject to heightened compliance requirements. Use of such data is at your sole risk and it's your sole responsibility to notify your end users about not including personal or sensitive information with their use of previews, as appropriate. We don't provide support for previews and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won't be able to help you with issues or questions. This preview, and any one-off support Microsoft may elect to provide, is provided "as-is," "with all faults," "as available," and without warranty.

By default, deal manager is enabled only for administrators. As an administrator, you can grant access to specific security roles or to all security roles in your organization.  

**To grant access**

1. In the Sales Hub app, select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") in the lower-left corner, and then selectÂ **App Settings**. 
1. Under **General Settings**, select **Deal manager (preview)**.
1. Under **Define team access**, select one of the following:
    - Select **All security roles** to grant access to all users.
    - Select **Specific security roles**, and then add the security roles that you want to grant access to.
1. Select **Publish**.

The deal manager workspace is now available to the selected roles. More information: [Access the deal manager workspace](access-deal-manager.md)

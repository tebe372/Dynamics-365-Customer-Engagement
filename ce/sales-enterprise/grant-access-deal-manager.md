By default, deal manager is enabled only for administrators. As an administrator, you can grant access to specific security roles or to all security roles in your organization.  

**To grant access**

1. Access the [deal manager settings page](enable-deal-manager-preview.md#access-deal-manager-settings).

1. Under **Define team access**, select one of the following:
    - Select **All security roles** to grant access to all users.
    - Select **Specific security roles**, and then add the security roles that you want to grant access to.
1. Select **Publish**.

The deal manager workspace is now available to the selected roles. More information: [Access the deal manager workspace](access-deal-manager.md)

# Create or edit a competitor record (Sales, Enterprise)
You already know that tracking your competitors and their strengths and weaknesses can help you win sales. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] lets you store the details about competitors so that you and your colleagues can share and stay current with the latest details.  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_sales_competitors](../includes/proc-sales-competitors.md)]  
  
2.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   If you're using the Dynamics 365 application, click **New**.  
  
    -   If you're using Dynamics 365 for Outlook, in the **Records** tab, click **New**.  
  
3. [!INCLUDE[proc_handy_infotips](../includes/proc-handy-infotips.md)]  
  
4.  Choose **Save**.  
  
5.  To associate a competitor with an opportunity, in the **Opportunity** area, choose ![Add button](../sales-enterprise/media/add-button.PNG "Add button"). In the **Search** box, choose the Lookup icon, and then select an opportunity from the results.

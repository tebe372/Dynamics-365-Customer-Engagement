# Create or edit a competitor record (Sales and Sales Hub)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Tracking your competitors and their strengths and weaknesses can help you win sales. Use [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] to store details about competitors that you and your colleagues can share, and stay current with the latest details.  

## Create a competitor (Sales Hub)

1.	Select the site map  ![Site Map icon](media/site-map-icon.png "site map icon"), and then select **Competitors**.

2.	On the command bar, select **New**.

3.	Fill in your information. Use the handy tooltips as a guide.

4.	On the command bar, select **Save**. 


## Create a competitor (Sales)
[//]: # (In step 2, if you don't have two options, you don't want to say "do one of the following." Also, I don't know which token to suggest for "Dynamics 365 application"--I'm not sure what it's referring to.)

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_sales_competitors](../includes/proc-sales-competitors.md)]  
  
2.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   If you're using the Dynamics 365 application, select **New**.  
  
<!--    -   If you're using Dynamics 365 for Outlook, in the **Records** tab, select **New**.  
-->  
3. [!INCLUDE[proc_handy_infotips](../includes/proc-handy-infotips.md)]  
  
4.  Select **Save**.  
  
5.  To associate a competitor with an opportunity, in the **Opportunity** area, choose ![Add button](../sales-enterprise/media/add-button.PNG "Add button"). In the **Search** box, choose the Lookup icon, and then select an opportunity from the results.

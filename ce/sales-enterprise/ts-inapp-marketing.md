## When I open the Marketing List form, the Members view isn't available

**Reason**

The error is occurring due to the customization of views for each subgrid in the Marketing List form, causing the member list to appear empty.

<a name="im-unable-to-associate-a-campaign-created-from-marketing-list-form-with-marketing-list-record-in-unified-interface"></a>
## I can't associate a campaign created from the Marketing List form with a Marketing List record in Unified Interface

**Reason**

The error occurs because the attribute **TmpRegardingObjectId** has been removed from the Campaigns form.

<a name="unable-to-find-related-account-field-for-a-member-account-using-advanced-find-in-unified-interface"></a>
## I can't find a related account field for a member account by using advanced find in Unified Interface

**Reason**

The error occurs because the Contact or Account display name has been changed in the application, and the **Company Name (RELATED_TYPE)** picks the related type from the changed display name.

**Resolution**

In Unified Interface, the company name entity is available as **Company Name (Account)**. For example, if you rename the **Account** as **Organization**, the entity will be renamed as **Company Name (Organization)**.

<a name="unable-to-send-emails-using-email-quick-campaign-distribution-list"></a>
## I can't send emails by using the email quick campaign distribution list

**Reason**

The issue occurs because of one of the following reasons:

- The users don't have permissions to send emails on behalf of other users.
- The owner of the record (marketing list members) hasn't allowed other Dynamics 365 users to send emails on the owner's behalf.

**Resolution**

To resolve the issue, do one of the following:

- For the user who's creating the quick campaign, the **Send Email as Another User** privilege must be assigned to at least one role assigned to the user. More information: [Create a security role with team member's privilege inheritance](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges#create-a-security-role-with-team-members-privilege-inheritance)
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Provide permission to send email as another user privilege for the user.](media/troubleshooting-inapp-campaign-unable-send-email-assign-role.png "Provide permission to send email as another user privilege for the user")   
- For the owner of the record, the **Allow other Microsoft Dynamics 365 users to send email on your behalf** check box must be selected under **Select whether other users can send email for you** on the **Set Personal Options** dialog box.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Allow other users to send email on the owner's behalf.](media/troubleshooting-inapp-campaign-allow-send-email-behalf-owner.png "Allow other users to send email on the owner's behalf")

<a name="unable-to-change-the-form-field-in-the-email-within-the-quick-campaign-wizard"></a>
## I can't change the form field in the email within the quick campaign wizard

**Reason**

The issue is caused by insufficient permissions for the **Send Email as another User** option for your role.

**Resolution**

Provide sufficient permissions for the **Send Email as another User** option to one of your roles.

<a name="unable-to-see-email-templates-in-the-distribute-dialog-box"></a>
## I can't see email templates in the distribute dialog box

**Reason**

The Unified Interface implementation of the email template selector used during campaign distribution relies on certain access levels for different entities.

**Resolution**

To resolve the issue, users require access to system user records. Provide the access to system users by assigning them security roles in your Dynamics 365 organization. More information: [Configure user security to resources in an environment](/power-platform/admin/database-security)

<a name="campaign-activity-distribution-related-issues"></a>
## Campaign activity distribution issues

### The campaign distribution process is stuck with a status of Pending or Failed

**Reason**

The campaign distribution process requires a workflow to run in the background. When the workflow is disabled, campaign distribution won't be completed and will be stuck in a **Pending** or **Failed** state.

**Resolution**

To resolve this issue, enable the workflow background process.

1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **System** > **System Jobs**.     
2. Go to **ActivityPropagation** jobs and under **Process Sessions**, select the job that matches&mdash;or approximately matches&mdash;the date and time at which the quick campaign was run.    
3. Verify that an error message is displayed under the details section, stating that the async operation was skipped because the org is in **Disable Background Processing** mode. Update the settings for your environment by doing the following:
   1. Go to the Dynamics 365 admin center, select your instance, and then select **Admin Settings**.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select Admin Settings from the admin center.](media/troubleshooting-inapp-campaign-distribution-admin-settings.png "Select Admin Settings from the admin center")   
   1. Clear the **Disable background operations** check box.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Clear the Disable background operations check box.](media/troubleshooting-inapp-campaign-distribution-clear-background-operations.png "Clear the Disable background operations check box")
4. Save your settings, and exit.

### My quick campaign failed and is set to Aborted

**Reason**

The issue is caused by the failure of a stack trace that's related to the custom plug-ins in the workflow process.

**Resolution**

1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **System** > **System Jobs**.
2. Go to **ActivityPropagation** jobs and under **Process Sessions**, select the job that matches&mdash;or approximately matches&mdash;the date and time at which the quick campaign was run.

The system job contains information that includes the stack trace that has the failure. Resolve the failure as mentioned in the stack trace failure documentation.

### The quick campaign is executing an unstoppable loop and generating thousands of failure records

**Reason**

Due to unknown conditions, when a workflow fails to create campaign activities, it goes into an unstoppable loop and keeps creating campaign activities, which all fail. You'll observe that the number of failures keeps increasing until it exceeds the number of members in the targeted marketing list.

**Resolution**

Deactivate the **ActivityPropagation** workflow, and then activate it again.

1.	Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.
2.	From the site map, go to **Processes**.
3.	In the view selector, select **All**.
    All the available processes are displayed.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select All in the view selector.](media/troubleshooting-inapp-campaign-distribution-select-all-view-selector.png "Select All in the view selector")   
4.	Select the **ActivityPropagation** workflow, and then select **Deactivate**.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Deactivate the ActivityPropagation workflow.](media/troubleshooting-inapp-campaign-distribution-deactivate-activity-propagation-workflow.png "Deactivate the ActivityPropagation workflow")   
5.	Wait 24 hours, and then reactivate the **ActivityPropagation** workflow.

### Campaign distribution doesn't create activities on target entities

Target records (account, contact, and lead) can identify their preferences for receiving marketing materials through campaign distribution: these include emails, phones, fax, and bulk mail.
Campaign activities are created for members of the Marketing List only when their preferences are set to **Allow** or **Send**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Set contact preferences to allow or send.](media/troubleshooting-inapp-campaign-distribution-set-contact-preferences-allow-send.png "Set contact preferences to allow or send")

### Campaign distribution is failing for some members

**Reason**

Campaign distribution is based on the members in the marketing list. The member can be an account, contact, or lead. A campaign distribution can fail for members due to one of the following reasons:

- There's no email address associated with the member.
- The email address associated with the member is invalid.
- The member has configured the **Send Marketing Material** field in the member record as **Do not send**.

**Resolution**

Review the detailed reason for the failure in the **Excluded members** grid, and take any necessary action.

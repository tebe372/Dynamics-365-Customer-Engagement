# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Sales trial

Sales offers a 30-day free trial. After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data and even try out your own customer data. [Learn more about Dynamics 365 Sales features](overview.md).

**To sign up for the trial**: 

1. Go to the [Sales overview page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/overview/) and select **Try for free**.
1. Follow the onscreen guidance to enter the [email associated with your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/what-is-a-microsoft-account-4a7c48e9-ff5a-e9c6-5a5c-1a57d66c3bfa) and contact information.  
    The trial takes a few seconds to load, then you can start using the app.

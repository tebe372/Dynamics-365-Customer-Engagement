# Create or edit leads (Sales and Sales Hub)

In [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], you use leads to keep track of business prospects that you haven't yet qualified through your sales process. A lead can be an existing client or someone you've never done business with before. You might get leads from different sources, such as advertising, networking, or email campaigns.

## Create a lead  (Sales Hub)
  
1. In the site map, select **Leads**. 
  
2. Select **+ New**.

3. Follow the process bar to enter data into fields to move the lead to the next stage. 

4. If you're creating the lead for new customers, enter name, contact details, and company name in the **Lead** form.

    -OR-
    
    If you're creating the lead for an existing account or contact, in the **Qualify** stage of the process bar, select the existing account or contact.

    - When you select an existing account while creating a lead record, the company name is automatically populated. 
    
    -    When you select an existing contact while creating a lead record, the following information is automatically populated in the **Lead** form: First Name, Last Name, Job Title, Business Phone, Mobile Phone and Email.

           > [!NOTE]
           > -  Auto-population happens only when creating a new lead and when the corresponding fields in the Lead form are empty. If fields are auto-populated or data is manually entered, the auto population doesn't override the existing values. 
           >  -  On new (unsaved) lead records, the **Existing Contact** and **Existing Account** fields allow you to choose any records. Once you save the lead record, these fields are filtered to show only the records that meet the duplicate detection rules to avoid duplicates.    
  
5. In the **Timeline** section, add any notes or activities (for example, phone calls or tasks) related to this lead. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Keep track of notes, tasks, calls, or email with activities](../basics/work-with-activities.md)  

6. In the **Stakeholders** section, select the **More Commands** button ![More Commands button](media/more-button-stakeholders-grid.png "More Commands button"), and then select **+ New Connection** to add a contact as a stakeholder. A *stakeholder* is a key contact at the account who will be involved in decision-making. 

   In the **Lookup Records** dialog box, enter a name or select the Lookup icon to choose from a list of suggestions. When you've entered the name you want, select **Add**. To create a new contact, select **+ New**. By default, the contact you add is assigned the Stakeholder role. Select the role corresponding to the contact to select a different role such as Decision Maker or Technical Buyer. 
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The "+ New" button on Connection sub-grids are supported only for the out-of-box "Stakeholders" views on the Lead entity. For any other Connection sub-grid or "Stakeholders" sub-grids that are based on custom views, the "+ New" button doesn't appear on the sub-grid. In such case, navigate to the Connection Associated view for the record and use the **Connect** button to create a new connection. 

7. In the **Details** area of the **Lead** form, enter information about your lead's industry and preferred contact method.  
   
8. On the command bar, select **Save**.

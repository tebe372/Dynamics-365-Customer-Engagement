# Create or edit a lead (Sales, Enterprise)
In the Sales app, you use leads to keep track of business prospects that you haven't yet qualified through your sales process. A lead can be someone you’ve never done business with before, or it could be an existing client. You might get leads from different sources, such as advertising, networking, or email campaigns.

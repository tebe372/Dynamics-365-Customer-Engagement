# Trial FAQ

The Sales trial offers a straightforward experience for sign-up, login, and usage. However, if you're stuck or have questions about the trial, check out this page for answers.

[!INCLUDE[trial-faq-platform](../shared/trials/trial-faq-platform.md)]

## How do I start using the trial?

When the trial is ready, you can get started with the following resources:

**Explore product tours and videos for key capabilities**

The trial comes with product tours and videos, highlighting the important scenarios that you could try in the app and get the maximum value in minimal time. Select the **Get started** page and open the tour for the scenario that you are interested in. Once you understand how different entities are connected to offer value, try the scenarios with sample data or with your own data. 

**Play around with the mobile app**

Install the Sales mobile app and explore the functionalities that you can access on the move. Open the **Get started** page and scroll down to the **Take it to go** section to download the app. For more information on using the app, see [Use the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app](sales-mobile/use-sales-mobile-app.md).


**Deep dive into more scenarios**

If you want to test scenarios beyond the ones covered in the product tour, go ahead and take a plunge. Browse through other capabilities from the sitemap (left pane). Visit the [Help hub](help-hub.md) for assistance.

## What are the trial limits and quotas?

The following limitations apply for the trial:

- The trial is available to you for 30 days. After that, you can request for an extension for another 30 days, buy a paid license, or sign up for a new trial.  
- The trial will expire if there’s no activity on the app for 14 consecutive days. Expired trials cannot be reactivated. However, you can start a new trial.  
- You can have only one active trial per app at any given time. However, you can sign up again after your current trial for the app ends.    

## Why the sample data is not available to all trial users?

Sample data related to forecasting and Sales accelerator are only available to the user who signed up for the trial. 

**To give access to other trial users**: 

1. Select **Leads** in the sitemap (left pane).  
1. Select the sample data and select **Assign** in the command bar. 
1. In the **Assign to** field, select **User or Team** and then pick the user or team name. 
   If you haven't created the team yet, you can select **New Record** in the **User or Team** drop-down to create a team and add the trial users. You can then come back and perform steps 1 to 3.

## How do I remove sample data from the trial?

Sample data resembles real-life data and helps you learn how the product works if it was deployed in an organization. In some cases, you may want to remove sample data. For example, the sample data is interfering with the scenarios you want to try out.

**To remove sample data:**

1. In the Sales sitemap, select the **Get Started** page.  
1. Scroll down to the **Manage sample data** section and select **Remove sample data**.
     After you confirm, it takes a few seconds to remove the sample data.
    > [!NOTE]
    > This action doesn't delete the data that you have added in the trial app.

## How do I restore sample data?

If you have modified the sample data and want to restore it back to the original, you can do so.

**To restore sample data:**

1. In the Sales sitemap, select the **Get Started** page.  
1. Scroll down to the **Manage sample data** section and select **Remove sample data**.  
1. After the existing sample data is completely removed, you'll see **Add sample data**.  
1. Select **Add sample data** to add the fresh sample data.

# Qualify a lead and convert it to an opportunity (Sales, Enterprise)
Does your lead have what you’re looking for—and vice versa? Once you’ve identified the timeframe, budget, purchase process, and decision makers for the sale, it’s time to qualify your lead. Qualifying a lead in the Sales app converts it to an opportunity.  
  
 Ideally, your leads or prospects should have a need that you can provide a solution for, and have the budget and influence necessary for making the purchasing decision. In addition, you should be able to provide their solution within the time frame they need it.

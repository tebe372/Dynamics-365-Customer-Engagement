# Clone a forecast

You can clone a forecast to duplicate the configurations made in a previous forecast in a draft state. This allows you to retain some configurations while making edits to others to create a new forecast that matches your requirements. After you make the changes, you can save and activate the cloned forecast.     
**To clone a forecast**   
1.	Sign in to the **Sales Hub** app.   
2.	In the site map, select the **Change area** to change the work area, and then select **App Settings**.    
3.	Under **Performance management**, select **Forecast configuration**.    
    The forecast configuration page opens.    
4.	On the forecast that you want to clone, select more options, and then select **Clone**.   
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]    
    > ![Select clone from more options](media/forecast-select-clone.png "Select clone from more options")   
5.	On the confirmation message, select **OK**.     
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]    
    > ![Select OK on confirmation message](media/forecast-clone-confirmation-message.png "Select OK on confirmation message")    
6.	The clone of the selected forecast is opened in the edit mode. Edit the forecast as required and activate.

# Mark a playbook as completed

When you complete all the activities created for a playbook, you must mark the playbook as completed. This helps you to know if the playbook was successful or not.

1.  To mark a playbook as completed, go to the record you launched the playbook from (calling record).

2.  In the playbook record, on the command bar, select **Complete as**, and then select one of the following results:

    - Successful

    - Not Successful

    - Partially Successful

    - Not Required

    > [!NOTE]
    > A system administrator or customizer can add custom values to this field.

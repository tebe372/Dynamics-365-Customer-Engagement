Microsoft Teams dialer helps sellers to be more productive and get work done more effectively by calling customers directly from within Dynamics 365 Sales app.     
As an administrator, you must configure Microsoft Teams dialer for sellers to use. Perform the following steps:

1.	[Review the prerequisites](#review-the-prerequisites).
2.	[Configure the dialer](#configure-the-dialer).

## Review the prerequisites

Review the following requirements before you configure Microsoft Teams dialer in your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app:     
-	You have a license for using Microsoft Teams. Any Microsoft Teams license will work. More information: [Microsoft Teams add-on licenses](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing?tabs=small-business).      
-	Your organization has a phone system installed, with a valid license to use it. More information: [Set up Phone System in your organization](/MicrosoftTeams/setting-up-your-phone-system).          
-	You must have a Dynamics 365 system administrator or equivalent security role. More information: [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).    

## Configure the dialer

1.	Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.          
2.	Go to **App settings**, and under **General settings**, select **Teams calls (preview)**.    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Microsoft Teams dialer configuration page.](media/teams-dialer-configuration-page.png "Microsoft Teams dialer configuration page")     
3.	In the **What you need to set up Microsoft Teams calls** section, the application validates that your organization has sufficient privileges to use **Phone system** and **Microsoft Teams**.
    - Upon successful validation, the status corresponding to **Phone system license** and **Teams license** displays **Status: Successfully set up**. Proceed to step 4.   
        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Phone system and Microsoft Teams licenses successful validation.](media/teams-dialer-systems-validation-successful.png "Phone system and Microsoft Teams licenses successful validation")      
    - <a name="tenant-admin-contact"></a> If any of the validations fails, you can't proceed with the configuration. Contact your tenant administrator to set up the phone system and Microsoft Teams for your organization.    
    When the tenant administrator completes the configuration of [phone system](/MicrosoftTeams/setting-up-your-phone-system) and [Teams licenses](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing?tabs=small-business), you can continue with the configuration. Select **Check status**.
        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Phone system and Microsoft Teams licenses failed validation.](media/teams-dialer-systems-validation-failed.png "Phone system and Microsoft Teams licenses failed validation")
4.	Select **Enable preview**.    
    >[!NOTE]
    >The **Enable preview** option will only be available after the phone system and Microsoft Teams licenses are successfully validated.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Enable the preview.](media/teams-dialer-enable-preview.png "Enable the preview") 
5.	In the **Security role** section, select one of the following options to provide permissions to users to view Microsoft Teams dialer. 

    | Option | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | All security roles | This option provides access to view Microsoft Teams dialer to users in all the security roles in your organization. |
    | Specific security roles | This option allows you to specify security roles when you want to give access to view Microsoft Teams dialer to specific users. |

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select security roles.](media/teams-dialer-select-security-roles.png "Select security roles")
6.	Select **Advanced options**, and in the **Select app** drop-down list, select, and add apps such as your custom apps. By default, **Sales Hub** is selected.     
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select apps to use Microsoft Teams dialer.](media/teams-dialer-select-apps.png "Select apps to use Microsoft Teams dialer")

    >[!NOTE]
    >When Microsoft Teams dialer is enabled in your organization for Sales Hub app, other telephony systems that are connected to the Sales Hub app through Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework will stop working. As an administrator, you can deactivate or delete the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework phone system. Follow these steps:
    >1.	Go to your **Channel Integration Framework** app.
    >2.	From the **Active Channel Providers** view, select the phone system.
    >3.	From the toolbar, select **Deactivate** or **Delete** according to your requirements.

7.	Save and publish the configuration.
    A confirmation message is displayed, and the Microsoft Teams dialer is enabled in your organization for selected security roles in the selected app. 
    >[!NOTE]
    >You must refresh the configuration page to make the changes available in the application.

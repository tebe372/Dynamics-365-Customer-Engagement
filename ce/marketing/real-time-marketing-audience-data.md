# Select the audience source for real-time journeys

Audience configuration allows you to manage your audience data sources. Real-time marketing supports **Contact**, **Lead**, and **Customer profile** entities.

To access the **Audience configuration settings**, go to **Settings** > **Customer engagement** > **Audience configuration**.

Contacts and Leads have default recipient fields set up for emails and phone numbers. The values from these fields are automatically populated in the *Send-to* field. You can modify the default settings by adding more recipient fields or changing the default field content.

Customer Profiles have no default fields set. You can choose which fields from a Customer Profile should be used when sending an email or text message.

## Change your audience configuration

To make changes to the audience configuration, select a data source (**Contact**, **Lead**, or **Customer profile**) and review the information in the right pane.

You can change the default recipient or add more recipient fields. You can select any of the fields you added when adding an email or SMS tile to a customer journey.

A default value is displayed in the *Send-to* field, but you can select any other recipient field from the dropdown menu.

> [!Important]
> For Contacts, only one recipient email address can be used. This is done to remove consent ambiguity. In outbound marketing, a Contact record may store several email addresses with one consent for the entire contact. But in real-time marketing, consent is given per each email address. Learn more in [Compliance settings](real-time-marketing-compliance-settings.md#outbound-consent).

# Manage your [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] instances

General instructions for how to manage [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] instances are available in [Manage instances](../admin/manage-online-instances.md) and its subtopics, but for instances where you also have [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] installed, some exceptions and added procedures apply. This topic provides details about the exceptions&mdash;for all other management tasks, see [Manage instances](../admin/manage-online-instances.md), but read this topic first.

## Elements in a [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] instance

Instance management operations are a standard feature of [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)]. However, [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] adds significant complexity to the system, so there are several extra considerations to keep in mind when you have [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] installed. 

[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] is composed of several components that you should be aware of to understand how the instance-management operations work when [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] is installed. For example:

- **[!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] instance.** This provides the basic platform for the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] app and includes both a *platform server* and an *organizational database*. This database is also shared by the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] app, which reads and stores much of its data here. The standard [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] backup and restore functionality applies only to these components.
- **[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] application.** This is a collection of solutions that are installed on the platform server and add marketing features to [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)]. It's also referred to as the *[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] app*.
- **Marketing services.** This is a collection of services that run in parallel with your [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] instance, and  which the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] app interacts with. Among other things, live customer journeys and marketing email messages run here.
- **Marketing insights service** This is a marketing service that provides big-data services such as resolving segment queries, storing interaction data, and providing analytics based on this data. The marketing insights service is one of the marketing services.

Marketing services run in parallel with your [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] instance, and thus follow their own lifecycle. These services aren't directly accessible to users, so when backup and restore operations are used on the organization database, you must consider their impact on these connected services.

## Copy your production instance to a support instance

 [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoft-support](../includes/pn-microsoft-support.md)] offers a service for testing pending changes (usually updates) on a copy of your production instance. If you wish to use this service, please contact [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoft-support](../includes/pn-microsoft-support.md)] to find out if you are eligible. If so, [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoft-support](../includes/pn-microsoft-support.md)] will create a support instance on your tenant and then ask you to copy your production instance onto it.

 For this operation, you can just make a simple copy of your production instance as described in [To copy an instance](../admin/copy-instance.md#to-copy-an-instance). There is no need to stop any live entities or make any other type of special preparation (as mentioned in the following section).

<a name="prepare-backup"></a>

## Prepare for copies and manual backups

The basic [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] instance and its database are automatically backed up every day by Microsoft. However, processes that are running in the parallel marketing services aren't backed up by this operation.

Processes running on the marketing services, such as live customer journeys and email marketing messages, aren't affected by the backup or copy operations, so these will continue to run normally, and the marketing insights service will also continue to collect data from them even while the organization database gets copied or backed up.

When you restore from a backup (or start running a copy), any data that was created or modified since that backup was taken will be reverted (or lost). But the processes running on the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] services will still be active, and the data that was generated and saved in the marketing services since the backup will also still be there. This means that if you want to make a copy, or to make manual backup to be restored later or on another instance, you should first stop all your running live entities by moving them to a *stopped* state. This includes:

- Customer journeys
- Marketing emails
- Content settings
- Segments
- Marketing pages

This helps to ensure that when you finish the copy or restore the data (especially on a different instance), no unwanted processes start without your knowledge.

> [!NOTE]
> Automatic daily backups don't pause any of your live entities. This helps to ensure that your customer journeys and other live features aren't interrupted by these backups, which are primarily made for purposes of disaster recovery.

## Restoring a backup onto a different instance

When you restore a backup that includes [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] onto a different instance, you must do the following:

- If your target instance (the instance you are restoring *onto*) already has [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] installed on it, then you must delete [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] from that instance before you restore the backup. You don't need to remove all of the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] solutions, but you do need to run the uninstall wizard on the target instance before your restore. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Uninstall Marketing](uninstall-marketing.md).
- After restoring a backup to a new instance (or copying a production instance to a sandbox instance) you must rerun the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] [setup wizard](purchase-setup.md) on the new instance. This is because the new instance needs to be set up with a new collection of marketing services.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a new set of marketing services is created for your new instance, all interaction data stored by the previous marketing services isn't available to the new instance.

For details about how to copy a production instance to a sandbox and then run the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] setup wizard on the sandbox, see  [Copy your current production instance to a sandbox](#copy-to-sandbox). The process is similar when you restore a backup to a new instance.

## Reset or delete an instance

For standard [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] instances (without [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] installed) you can use the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-admin-center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)] to reset or delete an instance. However, if you have [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] installed, you must completely uninstall it first as described in [Uninstall Marketing from a Dynamics 365 instance](uninstall-marketing.md).

## Change the URL for an instance

For standard [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] instances (without [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] installed) you can use the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-admin-center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)] to change the URL of an instance. However, *you can't currently do this if you have [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] installed*. 

Do not attempt to change the URL for a [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] instance. If you require a different URL, then you must set up a new [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] instance at the new URL and then reinstall [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] there.

## Copy your current production instance to a sandbox

A sandbox instance is where you safely can test new customizations, features, and settings without affecting your production instance. Most [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] licenses include both a production and sandbox instance. You'll usually want to start your experiments using a system that is as close as possible to your production instance, so the first step will usually be to copy your existing production instance to the sandbox. 

After the copy, your sandbox instance will be set up as follows:

- All settings and customizations from your production instance will be present in the sandbox.
- A new portal will be created to host marketing pages and event websites for the sandbox instance.
- A new set of marketing services (including a new marketing insights service) will be created and linked to your sandbox instance. Interaction data from your production instance won't be available to the sandbox, so most insights data will be initialized. You can freely generate new interaction data using the sandbox without affecting your production instance.
- If you choose to do a full copy:
  - The entire core database of your production instance will be copied and linked to the sandbox instance. This means that your previous production data will be available to the sandbox, but your work in the sandbox instance won't affect your production database from now on. 
  - Any live entities from your production portal (such as marketing pages and the event website) will be republished on the new portal created for the sandbox instance.
  - Any live entities that run on marketing services (such as marketing email messages and customer journeys) will also be copied and enabled as live entities on the sandbox instance.
- If you choose to do a minimal copy, all your customizations will still be present on the sandbox instance, but none of your production data (including email messages, portal content, and customer journeys) will be there.

To copy a production instance to a sandbox:

<!-- 1. **Important**: before you do anything else, [reset your sandbox instance](../admin/manage-sandbox-instances.md#reset-a-sandbox-instance). -->

1. [Open the Dynamics 365 admin center](dynamics-365-admin-center.md) and make sure that the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] application and its related solutions are all up to date on your production instance, as described in [Keep Marketing up to date](apply-updates.md).

1. As mentioned in [Prepare for copies and manual backups](#prepare-backup), move all your running live entities to a _stopped_ state if you will make a full copy. You don't have to do this if you're planning to make a minimal copy because live entities aren't copied during a minimal copy.

1. Return to the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-admin-center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)] and go to the **Instances** tab. Select your production instance (the instance you are copying from) and then select **Copy** from the side panel.  
    ![Select the Copy button](media/copy-instance-start.png "Select the Copy button")

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must already have a sandbox instance available before you can copy a production instance to it. Make sure you see a sandbox listed on your **Instances** tab. If you don't have one, please [contact Microsoft Support](setup-troubleshooting.md#contact-support) for assistance.

    > [!WARNING]
    > This operation will completely delete your current sandbox instance and replace it with a copy of your production instance.

1. The **Copy instance** page opens.   
    ![The copy instance page](media/copy-instance-details.png "The copy instance page")
 
    Do the following:
    1. Select your sandbox instance from the **Target instance** drop-down list.
    1. Set the **Copy type** to **Full copy** or **Minimal copy**. A _full copy_ will contain a copy of all production data, while a _minimal copy_ will include only customizations and a mostly empty database. See the intro to this section for details.
    1. To start copying, select **Copy**.

1. [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] starts copying your instance, which can take some time. You can monitor its progress in the admin center. When the sandbox shows a **State** of **Ready**, select it, and then select **Admin** from the side panel.   
    ![Select the Admin button](media/copy-instance-open-admin-settings.png "Select the Admin button")

1. The **Admin settings** page opens. Clear the **Enable administration mode** check box, if needed, and then select **Save**. (For more information about this setting, see [Administration mode](../admin/manage-sandbox-instances.md#administration-mode).)  
    ![The Admin settings page](media/copy-instance-admin-mode.png "The Admin settings page")
 
1. Select the **Applications** tab in the admin center to see a list of applications you have installed.  
    ![Open the Applications tab](media/update-app-tab.png "Open the Applications tab")
 
1. Select the **[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] Application** item, and then select the **Manage** button ![The Manage button](media/update-manage-button.png "The Manage button") in the side panel.

1. The [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] setup wizard opens. Select your sandbox instance from drop-down list and choose a new and unique prefix for your sandbox portal.  
    ![Choose an organization and name your portal](media/setup-form-1.png "Choose an organization and name your portal")
    
   > [!NOTE]
   > You need to rerun the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] setup wizard on your sandbox because your sandbox needs supporting resources, such as portals and marketing services, which are separate from your production services.

1. Select **Continue**, and then work through the rest of the setup wizard as usual. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [First-time setup](purchase-setup.md)

1. When the setup wizard tells you the installation is complete, you can start working with your sandbox instance.

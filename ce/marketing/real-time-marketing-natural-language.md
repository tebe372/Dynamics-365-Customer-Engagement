# Preview: Use natural language in real-time marketing journeys

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.
> 
> Microsoft doesn't provide support for this preview feature. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won’t be able to help you with issues or questions. Preview features aren’t meant for production use, especially to process personal data or other data that are subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements.

Natural language input enables you to use common words and phrases to describe a condition you want to include in your customer journey. The data model is built on top of Common Data Model (CDM).

## Sample conditions

You can create a segment that will evaluate your Dynamics 365 organizational database for customers who meet a certain criterion. For example, customers with an annual income of $100,000.

The following are examples of simple conditional phrases using natural language:

**Search by company**

- Customers who work at Microsoft (Profile)
- People who work in a company named Amazon (Profile/Contact)

**Search by demographic**

-	Female customers (Profile)
-	Contacts in Seattle (Contacts)
-	Customers who are in Ohio (Contacts)
-	Contacts with vice president as job title (Contacts)
-	Customers with vice president as job title (Contacts/Profile)

**Search by segment membership within your organization** 

- Customers who are in Loyalty Segment

1. Select **Send feedback**.

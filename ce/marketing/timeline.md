# Customer interactions timeline

The interactions timeline for a contact or lead provides a unified view of historical interactions based on customer activities in Dynamics 365 Marketing (both real-time  and outbound), Sales, and Customer Service.

> [!TIP]
> To learn how to configure the timeline and view interactions across Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, see the [Use timeline](/power-apps/user/add-activities) article in the Power Apps documentation.

Having a single view of all the activities that a customer engages in enables you to get a complete understanding of your customer. Business stakeholders (marketers, sales agents, customer service agents, account managers, etc.) can use the unified view of customers' historical interactions with the business to create personalized experiences through both digital and non-digital channels. For instance, a sales agent could learn about the newsletters that a contact has subscribed to due to previous marketing campaigns as well as the product pages and blogs recently explored by the contact to personalize communication with them in the next sales call. Similarly, a service agent could investigate the latest email communications received by a customer as part of a customer journey to help with an escalation scenario.

- Along with activities from Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, you can view interactions based on activities from both real-time marketing and outbound marketing, including interactions across the following marketing activities:
    - Emails
    - Text messages
    - Push notifications
    - Web activity
    - Forms
    - Events
- You can use filtering to focus on specific types of marketing interactions like all emails that were opened by a contact
- You can search the timeline for interactions related to a specific marketing asset
- Preview the communications (emails, text messages, and push notifications) that a contact received or interacted with as part of your marketing campaigns within the timeline

> [!NOTE]
> All historical interactions from real-time marketing activities are shown in the timeline for a selected contact or lead. However, historical interactions from outbound marketing activities prior to May 2022 are not shown in the timeline.

> [!TIP]
> Marketing app interactions automatically show up in the interactions timeline. If you donâ€™t see interactions from the Marketing app, make sure your marketing product solution version is 1.1.10512.25 or later.

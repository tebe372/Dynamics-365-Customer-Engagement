# Early access: Improved email content designer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an early access feature, which means that it's currently available only on opted-in instances. You can opt in for early access on any instance, but we recommend that you do so only on trial, test, or sandbox instances, which will give you a chance to learn the new functionality before it shows up on your production instances later this year.

For more information about the 2020 release wave 1 schedule, and for answers to frequently asked questions about the early access program, see [2020 release wave 1 features available for early access](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave1/features-ready-early-access).
>
>We encourage all customers to provide feedback related to early access features on the [Dynamics 365 Marketing Forum](https://community.dynamics.com/365/marketing/f/dynamics-365-for-marketing-forum), your Microsoft contact or partner, and/or through [Microsoft Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/get-help-support).

# Real-time marketing asset library

The centralized real-time marketing asset library lets you upload files that are automatically tagged by the app using AI. When authoring your email content, you can use the asset library's AI-driven suggestions to find the images that best complement your email content.

> [!NOTE]
> The asset library supports JPEG, GIF, and PNG images.

### Quickly upload assets

You can upload a single media file, bulk upload a few media files, or even upload an entire folder.

### Organize and find assets with ease

Use tags to organize your assets as needed. All images uploaded into the library are automatically analyzed and described by AI (using AI tags). As a result, you can easily find an image containing a searched object. For example, by typing “house,” you will find all images showcasing houses, regardless of their file names. You can also sort your assets by *Title* or *Last modified* date.

### View assets in different ways

Depending on your preferences, you can view your assets as a single photo, a thumbnail view, or a list view.

### Update your assets when needed

You can replace your assets with newer versions whenever needed.

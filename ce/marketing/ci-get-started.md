# Integrate Dynamics 365 Customer Insights with Dynamics 365 Marketing

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights applies artificial intelligence to analyze rich pools of customer data collected from across other apps like Dynamics 365 Sales, Service, and Marketing. Its standard functionality generates powerful analytical displays for each contact, which makes the information easy to understand and use.

With Customer Insights data, you can:

- Target unified Customer Insights customer profiles and segments. This enables you to engage every customer, regardless of whether the customer's data is in Marketing or Customer Insights.
- Base dynamic content (such as personalized tokens) in emails, SMS, and push notifications on measures such as loyalty status, subscription renewal date, parent account, or any other measure you have captured in the unified customer profile.
- Load data from Dynamics 365 Marketing into Customer Insights and combine it with customer data from other sources.
- Apply data cleansing, enrichment, fuzzy matching, and more.

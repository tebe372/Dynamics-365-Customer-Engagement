# Dynamics 365 Portal hosted

Before you start hosting custom event portal, complete the actions mentioned in the [Prerequisites](event-management-web-application.md) topic. The custom event portal comes as a Dynamics 365 Portal hosted web application when you install the Event Management solution.

The frontend part of the application is bundled into two resource files that are stored as Dynamics 365 Portal [web files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/portals/web-files), and the main single page application entry-point is stored as Dynamics 365 Portal [web template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/portals/store-content-web-templates).

Although the frontend definition is hosted on Dynamics 365 Portal, you can still fully customize it. The backend part of the web application is not customizable since the **REST API** endpoints are hosted on Dynamics 365 Portal as a set of [web pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/portals/web-page), and the code containing the business logic behind it resides in Event Management plugins which are not customizable.

## Additional project setup
### Environment configuration for portal hosted

1. Duplicate the `environment.d365.ts` configuration file (located in `\src\environments`) and name it `environment.ts`.
1. Open the `environment.ts` configuration file (located in `\src\environments`) for modification.
1. Change the `apiEndpoint` variable to point to the in **Portal Website Binding** configured URL.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to add a trailing slash at the end of the URL.

1. Make sure that the `useRestStack` variable is set to false.

### Local Development
#### Bypass CSRF
You need to bypass the **anti-CSRF** token for local development. To do that, you need to go to **Dynamics 365 > Portals > Web Templates** and open the **PortalAPI** web template and flip the flag `bypassTokenVerification` to `true`. Restart Portals to make sure that the settings are applied.

> [!NOTE]
> The **PortalAPI** web template is added by default when you install the Event Management data.

#### Serving page locally
In order to serve the application locally you need to follow the steps below:

1.	Run `npm install` to make sure all the dependencies are installed and are up-to-date.
2.	Run `ng serve` to start the local development server to see the changes immediately.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find more information on serving an Angular application locally here [Serving an Angular application locally]( https://angular.io/guide/quickstart#step-3-serve-the-application)


### Deployment

You need to replace the files hosted under portals. Replacing can be done using the provided script, or manually if something fails during the automatic process.

> [!NOTE]
> You donâ€™t need to change all the files, usually main.js and styles.css files are enough, but it is always good to use a source control tool to track the changes.

To deploy the customized **Angular** application run the **PowerShell** script `DeployToDynamics365Instance.ps1` located under scripts folder. The script builds your **Angular** application, prepare the output files to be suitable for hosting under Dynamics 365 Portal instance, it takes the localization files from the `Localization` directory and prepare them for hosting and then it offers you to log into Dynamics 365 instance that you want to use to host your **Angular** application. After you log in, it pushes the files to the instance. Clear your browser cache (restart IIS if you are using local Portals instance for development) to see the changes.

To manually replace the files in Dynamics 365, follow the steps below:

1. Open your Dynamics 365 instance.
1. Navigate to **Portals** and click on **Web Files**.
1. Open the web file `style.css` .
1. Scroll down to **Notes** section and delete the existing attachment.
1. Upload your `style.css` file as an attachment.
1. Now, open the web file `main.es` and scroll down to **Notes** section and delete the existing attachment.
1. Upload your `main.es` file as an attachment.
1. Restart the portal website and reopen your browser.

### CORS
If you want to serve the custom event website from a **custom domain** you need to configure CORS to allow that custom domain:

1. Go to **Dynamics 365 > Portals > Site Settings** and add a **new setting**.
1. Insert `HTTP/Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the name field.
1. Select your website (if you did not change the value it is named `Event Portal`)
1. Add the custom origin that should be allowed. For example, if the custom event website is hosted at the custom domain `https://contoso.com/` than the value field must be set to `https://contoso.com/`.
1. Click on save.
1. Restart Portals to make sure that the settings are applied.

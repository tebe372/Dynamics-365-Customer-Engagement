# Manually overwriting sample website 

The standard process of updating event management website is to download a new version of the website and then use the provided script to push the changes to the Dynamics 365 for Marketing instance, as described [here](portal-hosted.md#deployment). There are situations when it is not possible to push the new website definition because of some changes to the underlying portal web pages. If you are using [Dynamics 365 Portal hosted](portal-hosted.md) version of the event management website then portal web pages, web templates, and web files are used to host the compiled website. If we make the changes to those infrastructural entities, you need to update them manually. We don't update them automatically from version to version because of possible customer customizations made on them that we don't want to break. 

The set of web pages, web templates and web files that are required for the event management website to work is packed in a Dynamics 365 sample data format inside of the zip archive. It's a standard format that can be imported to the Dynamics 365 instance using [The Configuration Migration tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/import-configuration-data). 

As those entities differ from version to version, we provide a separate zip for every event management release. To get an archive that corresponds to your current event management version you need to find out what event management solution do you currently have installed on your Dynamic 365 instance. To do that, open your instance and navigate to the **settings** > **solutions** section. Note which **MicrosoftDynamics_EventManagement** solution version you have. If the version is `1.12.1006` then you need to do one extra step, and that is to search for **MicrosoftDynamics_EventManagement_patch** solution and if it exists note that version and use it to download the corresponding archive. See the following table to download the appropriate zip file containing data. If the build number differs from the one in the table, for example, `1.12.2326` instead of `1.12.2327`, you can still use the archive having the corresponding major and minor version, in this case, you can still use `1.12.2327` archive.

Manually overwriting event management website overwrites possible customizations that you made on the website, copy those customizations in a repository outside of the instance. After overwriting the website files, you can use standard `DeployToDynamics365Instance.ps1` script to bring your customizations back to the instance.

# Step 1: Create required entities and forms for custom channel

You might want to create custom entities and forms to store and display information about your custom channel. You might also want to build a configuration page to help users connect to an external service that your custom channel interacts with. Finally, you could build some dashboards to display some analytics information.

- [Create or edit entities (record types)](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/create-edit-entities)
- [Create and design forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-design-forms)
- [Create or edit dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-dashboards)

> [!NOTE]
> You can view all the entities and their properties, attributes, and relationships by using the Entity Metadata Browser tool. More information: [Dynamics 365 Marketing entity reference](marketing-entity-reference.md)

# Dynamics 365 for Marketing entity reference

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

All the entities that are installed as part of the Dynamics 365 for Marketing solutions adhere to the standard extensibility model in Dynamics 365. This implies that developers/ISVs can perform standard create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on entities if their user account has the appropriate privileges. This section provides entity reference for only those entities in Dynamics 365 for Marketing that has a specif developer use case scenario.

If you want to view information about all the entities and their properties, attributes, and relationships, use the Entity Metadata Browser tool. Entity Metadata Browser is a managed solution that you need to install in your Dynamics 365 for Marketing instance to view the entity reference.

    - **Edit Relationship**: Open the selected relationship form in the default organization, if the relationship supports this.  
    - **Text Search**: Perform a text search to filter displayed relationships using values relevant to the type of relationship.

- **Privileges**: View entity privileges. With this view you can:  
    - Filter the displayed privilege using the `PrivilegeId`.

> [!NOTE]
> When viewing the entity detail properties, youâ€™ll see that many complex properties are expandable. The most useful value is displayed with a link that allows toggling to a more detailed view. The detailed view reflects the structure of the data if you were to retrieve it programmatically. The detailed view also reveals other relevant data that can be retrieved in the same area, for example, if any localized labels are present for **Display Name** properties.

> [!TIP]
> To copy text from the page, simply select the text and use the Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut or the context menu **Copy** command.

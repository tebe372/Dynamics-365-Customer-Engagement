# Build segments in real-time marketing

To improve marketing return on investment, it is important to target the right audience. You can now build segments directly within the real-time marketing area of Dynamics 365 Marketing using the powerful, easy-to-use logic builder that doesnâ€™t require specialized knowledge of complex data structures and logical operators. You can even preview the estimated segment size and membership before you mark your segment as "Ready to use" in customer journeys.

## How to create a demographic segment targeting leads

You can now create dynamic segments targeting leads directly without having to connect it to a parent contact.

To target leads directly, go to **Real-time marketing** > **Audience** > **Segments** and select **+ New Segment** in the top toolbar. You can then name the new segment and select **Lead** under the **Select a target audience** dropdown. After you select the **Create** button, you will be taken directly to the segment builder where you can create and save your segment.

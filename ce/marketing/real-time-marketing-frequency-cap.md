# Limit number of messages sent with frequency cap

The frequency cap feature lets you set a limit on the number of messages your customers receive in a given amount of time through a particular channel. Some customers qualify for multiple journeys and campaigns that run simultaneously. This results in them receiving multiple messages through one channel in a short period of time. This can be perceived as spam and lower the customers' engagement with your messages. With the frequency cap feature, you can optimize engagement by controlling how many messages are sent across multiple channels over a period of time. This improves engagement, decreases unsubscriptions, and reduces the number of messages marked as spam over time.

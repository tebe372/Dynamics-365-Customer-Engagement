# Browser and system requirements

[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] is a cloud-based service that requires no special software running on users’ computers other than an up-to-date web browser. The system and browser requirements for [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] are the same as those for [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-office-365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] plans for business, education, and government, as listed in  [System requirements for Office](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=723597).

## General browser configuration

Regardless of which supported browser you use, you must configure your browser as follows:
- **Allow pop-up windows from [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]**  
You must configure your browser to allow all pop-up windows from your [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] domain (see your browser’s documentation for instructions). Most modern web browsers block all pop-up windows by default. Some browsers alert you when they block a pop-up window (for example by showing an icon in the address bar), but others do not. 
- **Allow JavaScript from [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]**  
JavaScript must be enabled for your browser, at least for your [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] domain. Most browsers enable JavaScript by default.
- **Allow cookies from [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]**  
Cookies must be enabled for your browser, at least for your [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] domain. Most browsers enable cookies by default.

## Enable touch for Microsoft Edge browsers

If you are using [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoft-edge](../includes/pn-microsoft-edge.md)] on a touch device, such as a tablet, then you must do the following to enable the touch-based drag-and-drop features of the content designers:
1.	Run [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoft-edge](../includes/pn-microsoft-edge.md)].
2.	Type "about:flags" into the address bar and press return.
3.	A page of local browser settings opens. Under **Standards Preview**, set **Enable touch events** to **Always on**.
4.	Restart your browser.

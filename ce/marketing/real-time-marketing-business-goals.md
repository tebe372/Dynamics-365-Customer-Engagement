# Set a business goal and measure progress through a journey

Most customer journeys are created to drive a specific customer behavior or action such as making a purchase, signing up for an event, or renewing a subscription. You can now choose the intended behavior as the goal of your customer journey and set a target you want to hit. Using the goal, you can measure the success of the customer journey on an ongoing basis. Goal settings enable you to make incremental improvements to reach your targets more quickly and effectively.

Using the goal-setting feature, you can:

- Define goals that track customer engagement and onboarding, drive a purchase, increase customer loyalty, or send general announcements. You can also customize goals to fit your desired outcomes.
- Measure the success of the customer journey on an ongoing basis using the goal metric and a target.
- Optimize your A/B tests and channel selections based on the journey goal.
- Express goal targets in count or percentage to determine how well a journey is performing.

## Create a real-time marketing business goal

1. Go to **Real-time marketing** > **Customer engagement** > **Journeys** and open an existing journey or create a new one.
1. Select **Goal** on the right side pane.
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can select only one goal per journey.    > 
1. Under **The goal of this journey is**, select the general purpose of the journeyâ€”for example, **Engage customers**.
1. Under **This goal is met when**, define successful criteria for the goal. The successful criteria may be in the form of completing a custom event, or completing an event from the event catalog.
1. Under **The amount of people needed for this goal is**, specify a target amount you think would mean success. For example, you might determine the goal was successful if 50 percent of the customers that go through the journey achieve it.

## Example goals and measurement criteria

| Goal                        | Examples                                                           | Possible goal measurements                                                                  |

| Increase loyalty            | - Upsell campaigns                                                 | - User is upgraded from a lead to a contact                                                 |
| Onboard new people          | - Remind customers who did not finish the sign-up process          | - Message is opened or clicked                                                              |
| Send a general notification | - New product announcements <br> - Alerts about upcoming changes   | - Message is opened or clicked                                                               |

## Attribution window for the journey

A user can only count toward the journey goal as long as they are actively a part of the journey. There is a default listening time of three days after the journey completed, in case the desired action takes place after the user left the journey. The app will not count the journey success of a user if:
- They never entered the journey because they were part of an exclusion segment.
- They exited the journey because they were added to a suppression segment and hit the goal after they exited the journey.
- The journey is completed and the user hit the goal after the default three-day window expired.

If a user is part of two journeys with the same goal, and the user hits the goal event after journey 1 has ended (or they have exited), but before journey 2 has ended (or they have exited), the user will *only* count toward the journey 2 goal.

## Analytics

**Filter by goal category**: To view all campaigns that share a similar goal, filter by the goal category. To filter by the goal category, go to the **Analytics** section in the left navigation pane and select the filter icon.

# Go live with publishable entities and track the go-live status of records

Many entities within Dynamics 365 Marketing require you to _go live_ with a record before you can incorporate it into your marketing initiatives. The go-live process checks a record for errors, prepares it for use, and then marks it as available. In some cases, the go-live process ends by moving the record to a marketing service, which runs in parallel and processes data-intensive features like bulk email sending, collecting and analyzing results, or populating dynamic segments. The go-live process is also referred to as _publishing_.

Some entities require you to stop live records before you edit the entity, while others let you push updates from the Marketing application without stopping the live process. In some cases, you won't be able to make certain types of changes (or even any changes at all) after you go live with a given record.

## Monitor go-live status with the status and status reason fields

Most entities in Dynamics 365 have a **Status** and a **Status reason** field. A record's **Status** is either _active_ or _inactive_, which indicates whether the record is in use, and affects where the record is visible and selectable in the user interface. The **Status reason** gives more information about the **Status**, and often functions as a substatus (which it usually does for publishable entities in Marketing).

For most entities, you can manually assign the active or inactive **Status** for each record using buttons on the command bar. For example, you might mark a contact as inactive, which hides that contact from most views but keeps it in your database for future or historical reference. For publishable entities in the Marketing application, the system usually manages the **Status reason** value (which is read-only) to give you more information about the publish status. For some publishable entities, the **Status** field is managed by the system and may not be editable directly either.

All entities provide a view selector for list views where you choose a saved query such as "Active journeys," "All live journeys," "Inactive journeys," and so on. In most cases, you can find inactive records by going to the "Inactive â€¦" view, where you can usually reactivate a record if needed.

## Customer journey go-live operations and status

For customer journeys, the **Status** and **Status reason** fields are managed by the system to indicate the journey's current go-live and operational status. Both values are read-only.

| Status | Status&nbsp;reason | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active | Draft | The journey has never been live and can be edited, saved, or deleted without restrictions.<br><br>To publish a draft journey, open it and then choose **Go Live** on the command bar. |
| Active | Live | The journey is currently live. If the current date is between the journey start and end dates, then it's processing contacts. The journey will automatically go to the stopped state when its end date passes.<br><br>To stop a live journey, open it and then choose **Stop** on the command bar.<br><br>To edit a live journey without stopping it, open it and then choose **Edit** on the command bar.<br><br>You can't delete a journey while it's live. |
| Active | Stopped | The journey was once live, and may have already processed some contacts, but is now stopped, so it won't process any more contacts or take any other actions. It may have stopped because the end date passed, or because you stopped it manually.<br><br>30 days after the end date, the journey will automatically change from _active/stopped_ to _inactive/expired_. After a journey has expired, you can no longer edit or restart it, but until then you can extend the end date and restart it if needed.<br><br>While stopped, you can edit and save the journey without going live. Select **Go live** to start running the journey again.<br><br>You can delete a stopped journey even if its end date hasn't passed. |
| Active | Live, editable | The journey is currently live, but you have chosen to edit it locally. The live journey will continue to process contacts and take other actions while you work with the local version.<br><br>Make the required changes and then choose **Save** to update the live journey automatically (after an error check) and return to the active/live state. You can't delete a journey while it's in this state.|
| Active | Error | An error occurred while the journey was going live. This issue is usually temporary so you should wait a short time, then try again to go live. |
| Active | Going live | The journey is currently in the process of going live. |
| Active | Stopping | The journey has been live but is currently in the process of stopping due to a stop request. |
| Inactive | Expired | The journey end date passed at least 30 days ago and the journey can't be restarted. You can delete expired journeys if needed. |

Some customer journey settings become locked (read-only) based on the journey's status reason. Some settings become permanent after you've gone live once. The following table summarizes these effects.

| Field | Draft | Live-editable and Stopped | Live and others |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Editable | Editable | Locked |
| Start date and time | Editable | Editable only if the journey hasn't started yet. | Locked |
| End date and time | Editable | Editable | Locked |
| Is recurring | Editable | Locked | Locked |
| Recurrence count | Editable | Editable | Locked |
| Recurrence interval | Editable | Editable (see note) | Locked |
| Content settings | Editable | Locked | Locked |
| Suppression segment | Editable | Locked | Locked |
| Time zone | Editable | Locked | Locked |
| Template | Editable | Editable | Locked |
| Pipeline (tile positions) | Editable | Locked | Locked |
| Tile settings | Editable | Editable (see note) | Locked |

If you attempt to stop records such as email messages, forms, or segments utilized by live customer journeys, a warning pops up to prevent you from stopping a record that may disrupt a live journey.

![Warning dialog when deleting a live record](media/customer-journey-publishable-entities.png "Warning dialog when deleting a live record")

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the recurrence interval after the journey has already started, the current iteration will continue to run using the previous interval. Your new interval will take effect starting at the next iteration.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the segment source for one or more segment tiles after a journey has started, the journey won't process any contacts that are no longer part of the segment and that haven't yet left the segment group tile. However, removed contacts that have already started the journey (that *have* left the segment group tile) continue to be processed to the end. The removed segment might be fully unprocessed, partially processed, or fully processed, depending on how far it progressed by the time you removed it. New contacts added by a new segment join the journey as usual, and contacts that were part of both the replaced and new segment continue where they left off.

## Marketing email go-live operations and status

You can manually set the **Status** of a message to _active_ or _inactive_ by using the buttons on the command bar. The **Status reason** indicates the message's go-live state and is read-only.

| Status | Status&nbsp;reason | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active | Draft | The message has never been live and can be edited and saved locally without restrictions.<br><br>To publish a draft message, open it and then choose **Go Live** on the command bar. |
| Active | Live | The message is currently live and can't be edited locally. It is available to be sent at any time by a customer journey.<br><br>To stop a live message, open it and then choose **Stop** from the command bar.<br><br>To edit a live message without stopping it, open it and then choose **Edit** on the command bar. |
| Active | Stopped | The message was once live, and may have already been delivered to some contacts, but is now stopped so no new copies are being sent. If the message is used in a customer journey, then the message won't be sent by the journey until you start it again (and contacts will wait at the related email tile).<br><br>While stopped, you can edit and save the content without going live. Select **Go live** to republish it. |
| Active | Live, editable | The message is currently live (and that version could be sent by a customer journey at any time), but you have chosen to edit it locally at the same time.<br><br>Make the required changes and then choose **Save** to update the live message automatically (after an error check) and return it to the _active/live_ state. |
| Inactive | Expired | A user has manually deactivated the message using the **Deactivate** button on the command bar. If the message was previously live, then this operation also stops it. |

Some email settings become locked (read-only) based on the message's status reason. Some settings become permanent after you've gone live once. The following table summarizes these effects.

| Active | Stopped | The record was once live, and may have been used, but is now stopped. If the record is used in a customer journey, then the journey won't send any messages until you start it again (and contacts will wait at the related email tile).<br><br>While stopped, you can edit and save the record without going live. Select **Go live** to republish it. |
| Active | Live, editable | The record is currently live (and that version could be used by a customer journey at any time), but you have chosen to edit it locally at the same time.<br><br>Make the required changes and then choose **Save** to update the live record automatically (after an error check) and return it to the _active/live_ state. |
| Inactive | Expired | A user has manually deactivated the record using the **Deactivate** button on the command bar. If the record was previously live, then this operation also stops it. |

All settings for content settings records are editable when the record has a status reason of Draft, Live-editable, or Stopped, but all are locked when the record is Live or Expired. No settings become permanent as a result of the record going live once.

## Lead-scoring model go-live operations and status

You can manually set the **Status** of a lead-scoring model to _active_ or _inactive_ by using the buttons on the command bar (as with most entities). The **Status reason** indicates the model's current go-live state and is read-only.

## Marketing forms go-live operations and status

Marketing forms are reusable form elements that you can embed in your marketing pages. They are published to the marketing services, where they are made available to marketing pages running on the portal. You can also embed the forms onto any web page, such as on your own website, rather than on a Dynamics 365 Marketing page.

You can manually set the **Status** of a draft or stopped marketing form to _active_ or _inactive_ by using the buttons on the command bar (as with most entities). The **Status reason** indicates the page's go-live state and is read-only.

## Events, session, and tracks go-live operations and status

When you go live with an event, Dynamics 365 Marketing makes that event available to the event website. The event website displays many types of information that are defined on, and linked to, the event record. The event and all its settings remain editable even after you go live, and any changes you make to a live event, and its related live records will immediately be reflected on the website too.

Event sessions work similarly to the event itself, and essentially function as sub-events that, taken together, create the overall event schedule. The event website shows a schedule of live sessions that belong to each event. An event can include both live and not-live sessions, but only live sessions belonging to live events are shown on the website.

Event tracks are collections of sessions, usually related by theme or audience. Tracks provide a convenient way for attendees to register for several related sessions at once. Like event sessions, you must publish each track to make it appear on the website for its related event. An event can include both live and not-live tracks, but only the live tracks belonging to live events are shown on the website.

Event, session, and tracks all have a **Status** field, which works the same way as it does for most entities, but their go-live functionality works slightly differently than for other types of entities. For details, see [Publish events, sessions, tracks, and related records to the website](set-up-event-portal.md#publish-event).

# Basic tutorials for core scenarios

This chapter provides exercises that illustrate the core functionality of [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]. If you've never used this product before, this is the best place to start. When you have completed the exercises here, you'll be able to:

- Create marketing segments that collect contacts from your database and organize them into logical groups that match your marketing strategies.

- Create a marketing email that meets all legal and deliverability requirements, and can deliver personalized messages to contacts.

- Create a simple customer journey that sends a marketing email to all members of a segment and records interactions such as message opens and link clicks.

- Create a landing page with a form that collects information from new and existing contacts and stores it directly in [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)].

- Create an automated customer journey that combines email messaging, landing pages, and multiple paths managed by interactive triggers.

- Set up automatic lead scoring, which can score leads based on demographic information and interaction records.

The exercises in this chapter build on one another, so we recommend that new users do them all, in order.

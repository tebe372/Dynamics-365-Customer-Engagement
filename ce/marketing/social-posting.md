# Preview: Schedule and post messages on social media

[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] can schedule and post messages directly to your organization's accounts on social media sites. Use the **Social posts** settings to author and schedule your posts. You can post from any social-media account that your admin has set up and authenticated in [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Configure your social media accounts](marketing-settings.md#config-social)

In the current preview version, only Twitter is supported, but we expect to add more social media channels when this feature becomes generally available.

# Purchase a license directly from the Marketing app

Previously, the only way to purchase Dynamics 365 Marketing was either through the [product website](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/marketing/overview/) or through a reseller. Now, you can purchase a Marketing app license directly within the app. This saves you time and simplifies the buying process. It also also tenant admins *and* non-tenant admins to participate in the purchase process, allowing all end users to self-service their purchase experience.

This article details who can purchase a license within the app, how can they purchase a license, and what happens after the purchase.

# Real-time marketing journey tile reference

This article describes the various capabilities available in real-time marketing customer journeys. For complete examples of creating customer journeys, see [Create an event-based journey](real-time-marketing-event-based-journey.md) and [Create a segment-based journey](real-time-marketing-segment-based-journey.md).

## Journey start

The journey start configuration lets you define how customers can start the journey.

### Event-based journey

- **Event trigger to start the journey**: Customers will start the journey as soon as the selected event trigger occurs.  
- **Repeating the journey**: Lets you configure how soon customers can repeat the journey if the event trigger to start the journey occurs again. You can allow customers to repeat the journey immediately, or only allow them to repeat the journey after a delay interval.
- **Exclude this segment**: Members of this segment will not be allowed to start the journey. This is an easy way to filter out certain segments of customers from starting the journey, even if they performed the event trigger to start the journey.  
- **Journey Timing**: Lets you specify the time window in which customers can start the journey. Customers must perform the journey start event trigger after the start time to enter the journey. No new customers will be allowed to start the journey after the end time. The end time only affects when customers can start the journey. If a customer is already in the journey, they will be allowed to continue the journey even after the end time.
- **Handling unresolved profile**: This option is only available for event-based journeys that target Customer Insights profiles. It takes time to create a full Customer Insights profile. If the full profile isnâ€™t available at the time the person triggers the journey, they can either start the journey immediately using defaults for any missing profile data or wait for the full profile to be available before starting the journey. To successfully communicate with someone without a profile, the event trigger must specify email (contactpoint_email) or phone (contactpoint_phone) attributes. See [Create a custom event trigger](real-time-marketing-custom-events.md). <br>
For journeys such as sending purchase order confirmations, both new customers and existing customers can trigger the journey. A new customer may not have a full profile when they make the purchase. By selecting the option to start the journey immediately even if the full profile is not available, you can ensure new users will get the order confirmation immediately without having to wait. All profile attributes for these new users will be treated as empty, so it's important to always include default fallbacks in personalized content as well as attribute branches.

### Segment-based journey

- **Audience**: The audience property lets you specify the segment of people that will start the journey. Segment-based journeys [support segments from outbound marketing as well as segments created in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](real-time-marketing-segments.md). The journey will use audience data based upon the segment selected. For example, if the journey is started with an outbound marketing segment that contains a segment of **Contacts**, the journey will use Contacts as its Audience data. Similarly, if the journey is started using a Customer Insights segment that is a segment of **Customer Profiles**, the journey will use Customer Profile as its Audience data. Once an audience segment has been selected, all other segments used in the journey must be of the same type (segment from outbound marketing or Customer Insights segment).
- **Exclude this segment**: Members of this segment will not be allowed to start the journey. Specifying an exclusion segment lets you remove anyone from the Audience that starts the journey.
- **Frequency**: Lets you specify whether the journey should repeat.
  - *One time*: One time journeys run only once with a static audience segment. This is useful for scenarios like one-time email blasts that are sent on a specific date to a fixed set of customers.
  - *Ongoing*: Ongoing journeys run only once with a dynamic audience segment. This is useful for scenarios like nurture campaigns where anyone who gets added to the audience segment can start the journey as soon as they are added to the segment.
  - *Repeating*: These journeys repeat based on the time interval specified. Every time the journey repeats, all the members of the audience segment will go through the journey. If any new members get added to the segment between the repeat interval, those new members will only go through the journey the next time the journey repeats. This type of journey is useful for scenarios like renewal reminders, where you might want to send people through the journey every time they are up for a renewal.

## Journey end

By default, customers will end the journey when they complete all the steps. You can set additional ways for customers to exit the journey by using event triggers or segments.

- **Exit when an event occurs**: Customers who perform this event trigger will immediately exit the journey no matter where they are in the journey. This provides an easy way to remove customers who perform the event trigger from the journey, ensuring that customers do not receive irrelevant messages from your customer journey.
- **Exit by segment**: Customers who are part of this segment will immediately exit the journey. This capability is often referred to as a suppression segment and helps you ensure that members of this segment are suppressed from the customer journey. Exit by segment will remove members of that segment from wherever they are in the customer journey. This is notably different from the *exclude by segment* property in journey start, which will only exclude members of the exclusion segment from starting the journey.

## Journey goal

Journey goals let you track and [analyze the performance of the journey](real-time-marketing-analytics.md). You can use an event trigger as the journey goal and measure the success of the journey based on the customers who perform the event trigger as they are going through the journey.

Journey goals can also help you determine the winner of A/B tests and find the best channel for channel optimization. For more information about using A/B tests, see [Experiment and refine real-time marketing journeys](real-time-marketing-experimentation.md).

## Messaging customers

Real-time marketing customer journeys let you reach customers through various channels including:

- [Send an email](real-time-marketing-email.md)
- [Send a text message](real-time-marketing-outbound-text-messaging.md)
- [Send a push notification](real-time-marketing-push-notifications.md)

### A/B test

A/B tests allow you to measure which channel or content messaging strategy leads to higher success. For more information about using A/B tests, see [Experiment and refine real-time marketing journeys](real-time-marketing-experimentation.md).

### Channel optimization

Channel optimization uses AI to find the best channel to reach each individual customer and improve your engagement. To learn more about channel optimization, see [Use AI-driven run-time channel optimization](real-time-marketing-channel-optimization.md).

## Branching the customer journey

### If/then branch

The if/then branch lets you branch the customer journey based on customer actions like opening an email or completing a purchase. The if/then branch will wait for the customer to perform the event trigger within the time limit specified. If the customer performs the event trigger, they will immediately proceed down the yes branch. If the customer does not perform the event trigger within the time limit specified, they will proceed down the no branch after the time limit has passed.

For example, you can configure the if/then branch to wait for the *Email opened* event on a previously sent email. If the time limit is set to *1 day*, the if/then branch will wait for the customer to open the email within that day. If the customer opens the email within that day, they will immediately proceed down the yes branch. If the customer does not open the email within that day, they will proceed down the no branch after one day.

### Attribute branch

The attribute branch lets you branch the journey based on various attributes including:

- **Customer's attributes**: You can branch the journey based on the customer's attributes like address or age. The journey's audience defines which attributes will be shown. For example, if the journey is for Contacts, only attributes for Contacts will be shown.
- **Customer's segment membership**: You can branch the journey based on whether the customer is part of a segment. The journey's audience defines which segments will be shown. For example, only Contacts-based segments will be shown for journeys that are meant for Contacts.
- **Attributes in event triggers**: You can branch the journey based on attribute values in event triggers. For attribute values to be shown, the event trigger must have previously occurred in the journey. Thus, you can only check the attribute values for an event trigger that starts an event-based journey, or event triggers being used in an if/then branch.

The attribute branch checks for attribute values the moment a customer enters this step. For example, when a customer enters the attribute branch step, the segment membership condition will check whether the customer is part of the specified segment at that instant.

## Preview: Activate a custom event trigger

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before itâ€™s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.
> 
> Microsoft doesn't provide support for this preview feature. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support wonâ€™t be able to help you with issues or questions. Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use, especially to process personal data or other data that are subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements.

Triggering a custom event allows you to use activate a custom event at any point in the customer journey. Additional journeys or [Power Automate flows](/power-automate) connected to the custom event will be triggered immediately when a customer reaches the tile. This includes custom event triggers used in exit criteria, goals, and if/then branches for journeys.

When using a custom event trigger, you can choose which data to send as part of the event trigger. You can choose customer profile data (for instance, attributes of the target audience such as contacts, leads, etc.) and data from other event triggers used in the journey (for instance, attributes of the event trigger that starts the journey).

For example, a loan application journey could have various steps that require a human agentâ€™s approval. By creating a separate customer journey or Power Automate Flow for loan exception approval, you can trigger it from various points in the loan application journeys where exceptions can occur. The data you send with the event trigger can be used to populate dynamic content or as inputs to other Flow actions.

To learn more about triggering a custom event, see [Preview: Use custom events as actions in real-time marketing journeys](real-time-marketing-custom-event-actions.md).

## Wait

The wait step will hold the customer in the journey for the specified wait period.

You can configure the wait step using the following parameters:

- **A set amount of time**: Customers will wait for the specified amount of time (for example, one hour or one day). The time period starts as soon as customers enter the wait step.
- **Until a specific date and time**: Customers will wait until the specified date and time. If the date and time are already in the past, customers will immediately proceed to the next step.
- **Until a time specified by an event trigger**: Customers will wait for the date and time that are specified by an event trigger attribute. This configuration is useful for scenarios like appointment reminders, where you can choose to wait one day before the appointment to send a reminder. The date and time information must be included in an event trigger that has previously occurred in the journey.

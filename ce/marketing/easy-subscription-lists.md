# Early access: Easy subscription lists

[!INCLUDE [cc-marketing-early-access-2019w2](../includes/cc-marketing-early-access-2019w2.md)]

Subscription lists in Dynamics 365 Marketing are based on the static marketing lists normally used for the in-app marketing feature of Dynamics 365 Sales. Previously, you needed to take care when setting up a subscription list to ensure that you set it up correctly to make it usable with the Marketing app. But now, we've added a new **Subscription list** entry to the main navigator of the Marketing app, and from here you can get started with a correctly configured subscription list with just one click. Now you'll have many fewer distractions on your way to creating fully functional subscription lists.

For more information about subscription lists and how they are used, see [Set up subscription lists and subscription centers](set-up-subscription-center.md), but when you're creating new subscription lists, follow the instructions here rather than the ones provided in that topic.

## Create a new subscription list

To create a subscription list using easy subscription lists:

1. Go to **Marketing** > **Customers** > **Subscription lists** to open a list of existing subscription lists.

1. Select **New subscription list** on the command bar.

1. A new list is created, preconfigured to function as a subscription list. Enter **Name** for the list and fill out the other information as needed.

1. Select **Save** to create the subscription list. After saving, you can use the **Members** tab to view, edit, or remove members for the list. Usually, however, you should allow your contacts to manage their own subscriptions using your subscription center.

## See which lists each contact subscribes to

As part of the new easy subscription list feature, you can now also see which lists any of your contacts is subscribing to. To see a contact's subscriptions, open their contact record, go to the **Details** tab and check the **Subscription lists** section.

# Preview: Use natural language assist in  real-time segments 
Segment creation traditionally required extensive knowledge of the complex data structures defined by your business. To simplify creating segments in real-time marketing, you can use natural language to describe the segment definition in simple English. Natural language segment creation lets you add the results query onto the segment builder at any level of the query logic, either as a new group or as an additional condition in your existing logic. You can even improve the natural language engine by giving feedback, helping you achieve more detailed results in the future.

To create a segment using natural language assist, select the **Segments** tab under the **Audience**. Enter the segment name and select the target audience (Contact or Lead). 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![create a new segment](media/real-time-marketing-create-a-new-segment.png "create a new segment")

As you enter the segment name, the natural language assist engine will prompt suggestions on how the query should be made. If the suggested segment information is accurate, you can select the **Use** button to apply the suggested result to your new segment.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![use a suggested result to a segment](media/real-time-marketing-add-a-suggested-result-to-a-segment.png "add a suggested result to a segment")

You can provide feedback on the suggested segment query by selecting the thumbs up or thumbs down button next to the result in the **Query Assist** pane.

# Reference guide for real-time marketing interactions

Most of the data in Dynamics 365 Marketing is saved in Dataverse tables. However, the marketing interaction data needs separate storage to accommodate a higher throughput of changes when customers engage with businesses by opening emails, clicking links, etc. This article defines the marketing interaction data interaction schema. Use this as a reference guide when exporting real-time marketing interaction data for custom reporting.

You can also refer to the [outbound marketing schema](/common-data-model/schema/core/applicationcommon/foundationcommon/crmcommon/solutions/marketing/interactions/overview) to export outbound marketing interaction data alone or with real-time marketing interaction data.

The table below is sorted by real-time marketing channels (email, text message, push). It includes the data tables and columns in real-time marketing interactions. The table also describes the type of interaction data stored. For example, the description column shows the msdynmkt_emailaddress field lists customers' email address. You can use this schema to plug the interaction data into your own reporting tools such as Microsoft Power BI.

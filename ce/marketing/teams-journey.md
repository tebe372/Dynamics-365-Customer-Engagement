# Take Microsoft Teams data a step further with Dynamics 365 Marketing

After you've hosted a webinar in Teams, you can use Marketing to continue the conversation with webinar participants, using attendance data to build relationships. Let's say you've hosted a Microsoft Teams webinar and are reviewing your [Teams attendance report](/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/meeting-attendance-report). Maybe some guests registered but didn't attend, while others canceled their registrations. You wish you could follow up with the guests to get feedback or tell them about an upcoming webinar that is more relevant to their interests.

## Here's what you can do with Teams participant data in Marketing

Marketing helps you automate and personalize the follow-up process. Using Marketing with Teams data, you can:

- Store and manage webinar participant contact information.
- Create groups of participants for targeted messaging (for example, participants who attended, who didn't attend, or who canceled).
- Use built-in email templates to send personalized emails that look professionally designed.

## Marketing terminology

Marketing uses different terminology than Teams for your participant data. The following bolded terms are tools that the Marketing app uses to organize, personalize, and automate your webinar participant data.

- **Contact**: In Marketing, participant data such as names, email addresses, company names, and mailing addresses are stored as contacts. You can use other tools, such as segments (see below), to group contacts for targeted messaging.
- **Segment**: A segment is a defined group of contacts, such as contacts who work at Contoso and attended a webinar. Segments allow you to choose the right audience to market to.
- **Customer journey**: After you've identified the audience you want to target, you can create a journey that automates a series of communications. For example, you can use a journey to send an email requesting a response from all participants who registered but did not attend a webinar. You may find that the webinar was off topic or was at an inconvenient time, helping you improve your future webinar plans.
- **Customer journey tile**: Each step in a customer journey is represented by a tile. The [tiles represent actions](customer-journey-tiles-reference.md)) that the Marketing app can take. For example, an email tile automatically sends personalized email messages to a segment of your choosing.

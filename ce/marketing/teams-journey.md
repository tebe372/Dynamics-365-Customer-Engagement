# Continue the conversation with Microsoft Teams webinar participants

After you've hosted a webinar in Teams, you can use Marketing to continue the conversation with webinar participants, using attendee information to build relationships.

Let's say you've hosted a Microsoft Teams webinar and are reviewing your [Teams attendance report](/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/meeting-attendance-report). Maybe some guests registered but didn't attend, while others canceled their registrations. You wish you could follow up with the guests to get feedback or tell them about an upcoming webinar that is more relevant to their interests.

By using Teams attendee information in Marketing, you can engage webinar attendees, converting participants to loyal customers.

## Here's what you can do with Teams attendee information in Marketing

Marketing helps you automate and personalize the follow-up process. Using Marketing with Teams attendee information, you can:

- Store and manage webinar participant contact information.
- Create groups of participants for targeted messaging (for example, participants who attended, who didn't attend, or who canceled).
- Use built-in email templates to send personalized emails that look professionally designed.
- Advertise upcoming events and webinars.

## Free 6 month Dynamics 365 Marketing trial

As an existing Microsoft customer, you are eligible for a free 6 month trial of Dynamics 365 Marketing. The trial allows you to integrate information about your Teams webinar participants with Marketing. To learn more about signing up for the trial, refer to [How to follow up with participants using Microsoft Teams and Dynamics 365 Marketing](teams-how-to-follow-up.md).

### What happens when the trial expires?

When your Dynamics 365 Marketing trial expires, your administrator will have to purchase a license for the app if you wish to continue using it. You cannot convert a trial app to a production app. This means that you will not be able to transfer data from your Marketing trial to the production app after you purchase a license.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams and Dynamics 365 Marketing each have their own [service-specific licensing terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering). The service-specific terms that apply depend on which service processes your data. For example, when you transition from Microsoft Teams to Dynamics 365 Marketing, your Microsoft Teams data related to the webinar (such as the attendance report, engagement data, etc.) is transferred to Dynamics 365 Marketing whereupon it becomes Dynamics 365 Marketing data and the Dynamics 365 service-specific terms apply.

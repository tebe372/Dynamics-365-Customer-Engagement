## 2022 updates

### October 2022 update

Dynamics 365 Marketing’s 2022 wave 2 release has arrived! The October 2022 update has six general availability features and four public previews from the [2022 wave 1 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/). The general availability features include advanced personalized content blocks, the ability to make quick updates and manage version control for journeys, brand profiles that allow you to easily manage content across multiple brands, the ability to test all custom triggers before using them in a journey with real customers, QR codes in emails for coupons and events, and feature-rich links in emails for websites, surveys, events, marketing pages, Microsoft Teams events, and calendar items.

The public preview features include custom channels that allow you to extend your outreach in real-time marketing, natural language segment creation in real-time marketing, static segments in real-time marketing, and the ability to create segments in real-time marketing where specific people are always included or excluded.

Monthly improvements include updates to personalization, segmentation, and text messaging capabilities.

#### Version number

| App              | GA release      |

| Marketing        | 1.88.2018.0     |

> [!Tip]
> To check your current version number, go to **Settings** > **Overview** > **Versions**.

#### General availability feature

- **Drive engagement at scale with highly tailored audience-specific content**
    - Conditional content helps deliver highly tailored content to drive engagement. Make the conditional content reusable by saving it in a content block. Anyone on your team can then reuse these advanced personalized content blocks in different messages to achieve personalization at scale with ease and efficiency. Use cases for advanced personalized content blocks include differentiated company contact information, depending on the recipient’s location; varying offers, depending on loyalty program membership levels; delivering required legal text in the language that matches the recipient’s language preference; and, a content block that delivers different discounts (for example, 10%, 20%, or 30% off) using unique criteria to qualify each recipient.

    > ![Screenshot of conditional dynamic content.](media/conditional-content-screenshot.png "Screenshot of conditional dynamic content")

- **Make incremental updates and optimize journeys while analyzing all past versions**
    - Editing journeys is now easier and more collaborative. You can now make light edits to live journeys, such as renaming elements and adjusting goal percentages without creating new versions. Also, because the Marketing app automatically version-tracks each update, you can make complex and structural changes to journeys confidently and collaboratively with your team. This makes editing journeys as simple as editing documents; each change is tracked and is available for auditing.

    > ![Screenshot of editing a live journey.](media/whats-new-live-journey-edit.png "Screenshot of editing a live journey")

- **Easily manage content across multiple brands in the email designer**
    - Brand profiles allow you to manage different brands easily. Reduce content-related errors by defining default senders for emails and default social links. Extend your brand profile entity with custom values that you can use when creating content. Create multiple profiles for your organization as well as for each of your business units.
    - [Release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/create-consistent-content-brand-profiles)
    - [Docs](brand-profiles.md)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of brand profiles.](media/whats-new-brandprofile.png "Screenshot of brand profiles.")

- **Test all paths customers take before publishing journeys**
    - Testing custom triggers before using them in a journey is the safest way to ensure that your expectations meet the customer's reality. The test send feature gives you reassurance in the quality and behavior of your custom triggers before you send them to your audience. To test your custom triggers, you can run internal users through the journey to determine if your triggers work correctly and validate the path that your customers will take.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of the test send confirmation.](media/real-time-marketing-test-send-confirmation.png "Screenshot of the test send confirmation")

- **Increase customer engagement with QR codes in emails**
    - Increase customer engagement and promote your business using QR codes for events or coupons. QR codes allow your customers to access marketing event information or dynamic links with just a single scan! QR codes work by simply scanning the code with a mobile device that is equipped with a camera and QR code reader application. Once the QR code is scanned, it is translated into actionable information such as a webpage or event check-in.

    > ![Screenshot of a QR code in an email.](media/whats-new-qr-code.png "Screenshot of a QR code in an email")

- **Create engaging email content using feature-rich text links**
    - Create engaging email content with text links to websites, events, and marketing pages. The text links can also allow recipients to join a Microsoft Teams event or create a new calendar item with a click of a button.

    > ![Screenshot of a feature-rich text link.](media/whats-new-text-link.png "Screenshot of a feature-rich text link")

#### Preview features

- **Extend your outreach with custom channels**
    - Extend real-time marketing using the communication channels you are familiar with to engage your customers in moments that matter. Use real-time marketing personalization, consent, and analytics tools to create compelling content and deliver it over your preferred communication channels such as a local SMS provider or WhatsApp. Capitalize on proven channels, plug any of them into your new or existing journeys, and unfold their true potential with Dynamics 365 Marketing to maximize customer engagement.
    - [Release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/extend-outreach-custom-channels)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of a message using a custom channel.](media/whats-new-custom-channel.png "Screenshot of a message using a custom channel")

- **Use natural language to create segments in real-time marketing**
    - Segment creation traditionally required extensive knowledge of the complex data structures defined by your business. Now, instead of selecting specific data tables manually, you can use natural language to create segments in real-time marketing by simply describing the segment definition in plain English. This flexible experience lets you add the results query onto the segment builder at any level of the query logic, either as a new group or as an additional condition in your existing logic. You can improve the natural language engine by giving thumbs-up or down feedback so that it can help you achieve even more accurate results in the future.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of segment creation using natural language.](media/whats-new-nl-segment.png "Screenshot of segment creation using natural language")

- **Create a static snapshot of segment membership**
    - Static segment lists are an important part of audience management for marketers. Use static segments in one-off campaigns or newsletters where it’s essential to implement segment membership based on a specific date or time. Static segments ensure that new people that become eligible for the segment will not enter the one-off journey, even if it continues to be live. You can create static snapshots no matter how the segment is built (whether it uses query conditions or manual inclusions or exclusions). The flexibility in static segment creation separates how segments are defined from how you want to update or refresh segments.
    - [Release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/create-static-snapshot-real-time-marketing-segment-membership)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of a static snapshot segment.](media/whats-new-static-snapshot.png "Screenshot of segment creation using natural language")

- **Create a segment where specific people are always included or excluded**
    - Adding manual inclusions or exclusions is a powerful way to augment segment building criteria. Manually include or exclude specific people to ensure segments always reach VIP customers, or just as an easy way to build test segments for journeys.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of inclusion and exclusion selection.](media/whats-new-include-exclude.png "Screenshot of inclusion and exclusion selection")

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Personalization**
    - While conditional content can be used for selecting the right image in a lot of scenarios, there are times when it is more natural to use a dynamic URL that comes from a Contact or some other entity when the content designer doesn’t have the visibility into (or doesn’t want to be involved in) how images are selected. Personalization is now supported in image URL boxes in the email designer, allowing you to use dynamic URLs for images.
- **Segmentation**
    - **[Preview]** You no longer must rely on admins to select data tables to be synced into the Marketing app to get started with segmentation. In real-time marketing, instead of waiting for admins to add data tables under **Dataset Configurations** in the **Settings** area, you can add tables to be used for creating segments to the list in the building experience itself.
    - **[Preview]** Build segments using multiple query logic groups. This opens more segment scenarios and more enriched segment definitions, such as “Contacts whose accounts are managed by partners in Contoso Consultants *but not* preferred to be contacted by phone”.
- **Text messages**
    - The refreshed text message setup wizard in real-time marketing allows for simplified SMS provider and phone number setup.

### September 2022 update

The Dynamics 365 Marketing September 2022 update has one general availability feature from the [2022 wave 1 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/). The general availability feature—conditional dynamic content—enables marketers to create personalized messaging more quickly and easily. Monthly enhancements include improvements to personalization and triggers.

Additionally, real-time marketing features are now available in France and Switzerland, completing geographical parity between real-time marketing and outbound marketing features.

#### Version number

| App              | GA release      |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Marketing        | 1.87.2024.0     |

> [!Tip]
> To check your current version number, go to **Settings** > **Overview** > **Versions**.

#### General availability feature

- **Win customer attention by creating conditional dynamic content with easy-to-use no-code experiences**
    - Conditional dynamic content is key to delivering highly personalized messages to customers. Creating content where entire sections target specific customer segments allows you to craft messages that align with your customers’ interests and preferences, driving engagement and brand loyalty. Until now, achieving this level of dynamic content was complex and required coding. With the new conditional content experience, marketers can easily create messages targeted to specific segments or attributes, bringing content that is truly unique to each customer without writing any code.
    - [Release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/win-customer-attention-creating-conditional-dynamic-content-easy-to-use-no-code-experiences)
    - [Docs](conditional-content.md)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of conditional dynamic content.](media/conditional-content-screenshot.png "Screenshot of conditional dynamic content")

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Personalization**
    - **[Preview]** Access even more data for personalization and fine-tune your customer outreach. In previous releases, you were limited to accessing Dataverse tables that were directly related to an Audience or Triggers. Now, you can access many additional commonly used Dataverse tables, such as Events.
- **Triggers**
    - Testing triggers before using them in a journey is the safest way to ensure that your expectations meet the customer's reality. The test send feature gives you reassurance in the quality and behavior of your custom triggers before you send them to your audience. For example, when you create an abandoned cart journey, you can use the test send feature to ensure that your “cart abandoned” custom trigger behaves as expected.
        - [Docs](real-time-marketing-test-triggers.md)
- **Real-time marketing geo expansion**
    - Real-time marketing features are now available in all geographies where Dynamics 365 Marketing is available. You can find a list of geographies on [Dynamics 365 and Power Platform availability](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/availability-reports/).

### August 2022 update

The Dynamics 365 Marketing August 2022 update has one general availability feature from the [2022 wave 1 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/). It also includes a public preview from [2022 wave 2 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/). The general availability feature is a new email creation canvas and user experience. The public preview feature allows you to use AI-powered Content ideas to kickstart email creation, now with built-in default data so you don’t have to create dozens of emails to get started.

Additionally, this update includes improvements to real-time journeys and personalization.

#### Version number

| App              | GA release      |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Marketing        | 1.86.2014.0     |

> [!Tip]
> To check your current version number, go to **Settings** > **Overview** > **Versions**.

#### General availability feature

- **Create emails faster with precise drag-and-drop, in-context menu, and easy-select interactions**
    - The reimagined email editor is optimized for a productive workflow, allowing you to quickly create engaging and relevant content. With this release, the editor is further enhanced with precise drag-and-drop interactions, easy selection of elements, columns, or sections, and an in-context menu for faster content creation so you can create pixel-perfect emails in minutes.
    - [Release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/create-emails-faster-precise-drag-and-drop-in-context-menu-easy-select-interactions)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of new email canvas.](media/whats-new-email-canvas.png "Screenshot of new email canvas")

#### Preview feature

- **Boost your creativity with AI-powered email content ideas**
    - Content ideas help you find writing inspiration. You can use Content ideas as a starting point when creating email content—it’s like asking a group of colleagues to brainstorm with you. Content ideas make creating emails simpler, more efficient, and fun. It's a new and innovative functionality with the latest AI technologies (GPT-3 language model) behind the scenes. Now, Content ideas includes default email content data, allowing users to get up and running even quicker.
    - [Release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/boost-creativity-ai-powered-email-content-ideas)
    - [Docs](content-ideas.md)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of Content ideas feature.](media/whats-new-content-ideas.png "Screenshot of Content ideas feature")

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Real-time journeys**
    - Deliver more personalized experiences by accessing a richer set of trigger data for defining the journey entry/exit criteria, conditions/branches, and waits. When you add any of these elements to the journey, you will now be able to see data attributes not only from the trigger’s core entity/table, but also from entities/tables directly related to those attributes. For example, when creating a journey to nurture new opportunities (using the “Opportunity created” trigger), you can branch the journey based on the “budget” attribute from the Opportunity table. This enables you to create journey variations for opportunities that are more likely to buy.
    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-personalize-triggers.md)

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Screenshot of trigger data feature.](media/whats-new-trigger-data.png "Screenshot of trigger data feature")

    - Multiple branch journeys now include a detailed analytics view. The detailed analytics view for the attribute branch allows you to see a preview of journey audience details such as name, ID, type, and time. This helps you gain additional insights into how the journey is executing.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Screenshot showing multiple branch audience.](media/whats-new-branch-audience.png "Screenshot showing multiple branch audience")

- **Personalization**
    - Conditional content (preview) enhancements: Preview and test send now remove content variations that are not possible. You can also give the default a name (like other variations) to help explain situations where the content will be used.

### July 2022 update

The Dynamics 365 Marketing July 2022 update has four general availability features and one pubic preview from the [2022 wave 1 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/). It also includes a public preview from the [2022 wave 2 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/). The general availability features include reusable content blocks for quick email creation, the ability to continue customer conversations by taking action on text message replies, multiple journey branches to create more personalized variations, and a new channel analytics dashboard to track delivery and engagement metrics across multiple channels.

The public preview features include the ability to edit live journeys with improved version tracking capabilities for real-time marketing journeys and brand profiles including custom sender profiles, social links, and custom fields for better branding consistency within organizations.

The update also includes improvements to real-time journeys, the text message channel, and event management.

> [!Tip]
> To check your current version number, go to **Settings** > **Overview** > **Versions**.

#### General availability enhancements

- **Quickly create emails with enhanced reusable content blocks**
    - Content blocks are reusable pieces of content that let you easily assemble rich and consistent emails. New and enhanced content blocks are now available in outbound and real-time marketing. The enhanced content blocks can include all standard elements such as text, images, and buttons, as well as custom layouts and personalization.

- **Continue the conversation with your customers by taking action on their text message replies**
    - Text messaging allows you to quickly communicate with customers. But it’s not enough to just send messages out, you also need to act on text message responses. Now, you can interact with your customers by creating journeys based on their replies to your text messages. Create custom keywords and add them to your messages and journey branches to continue the conversation with your customers.

    > ![Screenshot of a text message reply journey.](media/whats-new-sms-keyword-response.png "Screenshot of a text message reply journey")

- **Create more personalized journey variations using multiple journey branches**
    - Journey branches let you create personalized journeys for customers, engaging them in different ways based on who they are and their past actions. Create more than two branches at any given step in the journey—creating more fine-grained personalization and engaging each customer differently based on their unique profile and behavioral signals. This eliminates the need to nest branches and makes analyzing journeys easier. Merge the branches back so that customers can continue the common journey steps after going through their specialized branches.

- **Measure campaign effectiveness with a new channel analytics dashboard**
    - To create effective campaigns, you need to continuously track asset delivery across multiple channels. You also need to review campaign engagement metrics so that you can make improvements where needed. With the new out-of-the-box aggregated channel analytics dashboard in real-time marketing, you can track important delivery and engagement metrics at any level of aggregation—across all channels, journeys, and marketing assets. Zoom in on a particular channel or individual message. Identify trends over a specified time period to further improve your marketing efforts.

#### Preview features

- **Edit, publish, and optimize journeys by making incremental updates, while tracking and analyzing all previous versions together**
    - Improved journey version tracking and editing. Make light edits to live journeys&mdash;such as renaming elements and adjusting goal percentages&mdash;without creating new versions. Because the Marketing app automatically version tracks each update, you can make complex and structural changes to journeys confidently and collaboratively with your team. This makes editing journeys as simple as editing documents; each change is tracked and is available for auditing. Customers who are mid-flight in journeys are not impacted. Mid-flight customers can continue going through the journey version they entered while all new customers experience the journey with the latest updates. Copies are no longer created each time a change is made, leaving you with an uncluttered view of your journey list. Analytics are preserved for each version. This enables you to compare journey flow and goal attainment across journey versions.

Multiple branches eliminate the need to nest branches and make analyzing journeys easier. Merge the branches back so that customers can continue the common journey steps after going through their specialized branches.

#### General availability enhancements

- **Personalize interactions using a unified view of customer activity across Dynamics 365 Marketing, Dynamics 365 Sales, and Dynamics 365 Customer Service**
    - Sales reps and customer service agents use the Dynamics 365 unified timeline to view their customers’ past activities so they can personalize engagement. Now, reps and agents can also view real-time and outbound marketing activities in the Dynamics 365 unified timeline. The timeline allows filtering based on the specific type(s) of activity or interactions. The timeline also allows previews of individual messages sent to customers. Message previews enable, for instance, loan agents in a financial services firm to know what document request was made to a loan applicant in a previous email so that the agent can quickly find the right document.

- **Trigger journeys based on data changes in any Dynamics 365 app to engage customers at the right time without writing any code**
    - Interactions in any Dynamics 365 app can be used to trigger and drive customer journeys without requiring developers or customizations. Customers interact with several departments and functions in companies throughout their lifetime, all of which use their own CRM, ERP, and business apps. Each of these interactions, such as a service ticket being closed, represents an opportunity to engage more deeply with your customers. Data no longer has to remain siloed within separate apps and out of reach of your customer engagement or marketing automation tools.

    - Fixed an internal server error that sometimes occurred when creating a segment and going live with it.
- **Marketing emails**
    - Improved security in the email editor (updated components address potential cross-site scripting and information disclosure vulnerabilities).

- **Win customer attention by creating conditional dynamic content with easy-to-use no-code experiences**
    - Conditional dynamic content is key to delivering highly personalized messages to customers. Creating content where entire sections target specific customer segments allows you to craft messages that align with your customers’ interests and preferences, driving engagement and brand loyalty. Until now, achieving this level of dynamic content was complex and required coding. With the new conditional content experience, marketers can easily create messages targeted to specific segments or attributes, bringing content that is truly unique to each customer without writing any code.

- **Measure campaign effectiveness with a new channel analytics dashboard**
    - To create effective campaigns, marketers need to continuously track the delivery of assets across numerous channels. They also need to review campaign engagement metrics so that they can make improvements where needed. With the new out-of-the-box aggregated channel analytics dashboard in real-time marketing, you can track important delivery and engagement metrics at any level of aggregation—across all channels, journeys, and marketing assets. You can even zoom in on a particular channel or message. You can also learn from trends of important metrics over a specified time period to further improve your marketing efforts.

#### General availability enhancements

- **Use outbound subscription centers in real-time journeys**
    - Collecting consent is a critical business need. Subscription centers are a way to gather consent preferences from your customers. Businesses need to be able to customize their subscription center to match their branding and business needs. They also need the ability to create different subscription centers for different regions, brands, or lines of business. Now, you can bring the flexibility of subscription centers available in outbound marketing to real-time marketing journeys, enabling you to have multiple subscription centers, customized and branded to your needs.

- **Create emails faster with precise drag-and-drop, in-context menu, and easy-select interactions**
    - The reimagined email editor is optimized for a productive workflow, allowing you to quickly create engaging and relevant content. With this release, the editor is further enhanced with precise drag-and-drop interactions, easy selection of elements, columns, or sections, and an in-context menu for faster content creation so you can create pixel-perfect emails in minutes.

- **Personalize interactions using a unified view of customer activity across Dynamics 365 Marketing, Sales, and Customer Service**
    - Sales and Customer Service agents use the Dynamics 365 unified timeline to view their customers’ past activities so they can personalize engagement. Now, these agents can also view real-time and outbound marketing activities in the Dynamics 365 unified timeline. The timeline allows filtering based on the specific type(s) of activity or interactions. It also allows previews of messages sent to customers. This enables, for instance, loan agents in a financial services firm to know what document request was made to a loan applicant in a previous email so that the agent can quickly find the right document.

#### General availability enhancements

- **Create individualized journeys by adding conditions based on attributes captured as part of the event trigger**
    - Previously, marketers had to instrument fine-grained triggers for their journeys. For instance, they needed separate triggers for each campaign page if they wanted to create a unique journey per campaign. Now, marketers can simply ask their web developers to add a single trigger across all campaign pages. They can then use filter conditions on the trigger to spawn a unique journey per campaign page. This gives marketers more control over how they use triggers and enables them to create future journeys without needing new triggers every time. Trigger conditions are even more powerful when combined with out-of-the-box triggers such as marketing form filled or event registration, as marketers can now scope a journey to a specific form or marketing event using a single out-of-the-box trigger. Trigger filters can also be added at exits, branches, or to measure journey goals.
    - [Release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/create-individualized-journeys-adding-conditions-based-attributes-captured-as-part-event-trigger)

- **Take action with your customers in more ways by raising triggers from a journey to run another journey or Power Automate flow**
    - Marketers can trigger journeys as well as Power Automate flows directly from anywhere in their journey. When used to trigger other journeys, this allows marketers to chain journeys together and create multiple journeys that logically function together. Likewise, when used with a Power Automate flow, marketers can run any custom process outside of their journey or connect to myriad Power Automate connectors.

    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-custom-actions.md)

- **Improved email layout templates for faster content creation**
    - Default layout templates have been replaced with popular and useful layouts allowing marketers to easily kick-start the email creation process. The templates have a modern look and feel for a better experience. They include simplified guidance with more descriptive and actionable content placeholders.
    - [Release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/improved-email-layout-templates-faster-content-creation)
    - [Docs](email-templates.md)

- **Easily author personalized content using pre-defined dynamic text without the need to understand the data model**
    - With pre-defined dynamic text, marketers have a quick list of the most commonly used dynamic text to select from. Marketers can simply select and insert the pre-defined text into an email to personalize it. Marketers familiar with the data model can create and share additional dynamic text so that the rest of the team can focus on authoring content rather than learning database concepts. Not only does this promote ease of use, but it also customizes the list with dynamic text that’s specific to individual businesses.

    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-predefined-tokens.md)

- **Quickly create customer journeys triggered by marketing interactions such as webinar check-ins and form submissions**
    - New out-of-the-box triggers allow you to create customer journeys triggered by marketing interactions such as webinar check-ins and form submissions. This eliminates the need to create and manage hundreds or thousands of segments and journeys. Now, you can use one trigger per a form and marketing event. A single journey can replace them all – and dynamic content can be used to tailor the outgoing messages to the respective form or marketing event.

- **Connect Dynamics 365 Customer Insights with customer journey orchestration when using your own data lake**
    - Use Dynamics 365 Customer Insights data, such as customer profile and segment information, that is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage in the same way you do today with standard Customer Insights connected to Microsoft Dataverse.

#### Monthly enhancements

##### Real-time marketing

> [!Note]
> “Event triggers” are now called “triggers” in the app and the documentation. The change was made to avoid confusion when referencing event management functionality versus triggering real-time marketing journeys.

- **Marketing emails**
    - Link buttons or images to URLs, surveys, events, marketing pages, or files. You can also create button or image links that allow recipients to join a Microsoft Teams event or that create a new calendar item. Learn more: [Create real-time marketing emails](real-time-marketing-email.md).

    > ![Screenshot of link options for real-time marketing email.](media/real-time-marketing-email-button2.png "Screenshot of link options for real-time marketing email")

- **Personalization**
    - Now, you can personalize both an email and the customer’s journey relative to important milestones (such as order date or an upcoming appointment) by creating content variations and branches that use relative and partial dates when defining a condition using dates. Partial dates allow you to define conditions such as "Birthday is today" and relative dates allow you to define conditions such as "Birthday is next month." So, depending on when an email goes out and how close it is to someone’s birthday, a different offer can be shown. Learn more: [Personalize content](real-time-marketing-personalization.md#partial-and-relative-dates-in-conditional-content).

#### Bug fixes

- **Channel optimization (real-time marketing)**
    - Channel optimization will not recommend a channel which a customer has not consented to. If no channel has consent, no communication will be sent out and the customer will progress to the next step in the journey. Learn more: [Manage user compliance settings](real-time-marketing-compliance-settings.md).
- **First run experience**
    - Resolved an issue during provisioning that ocassionally caused the user interface to get stuck in a refresh state.
- **Marketing pages**
    - Fixed a form capture error that occurred when the URL to capture ended with a period. For example, *contoso.com/form.".
    - Resolved a form capture error that resulted when a URL had more than 1024 characters.
    - Session cookies are now changed (instead of being grouped together) after 20 minutes of activity (the default marketing page setting). Learn more about cookie settings: [Set up website tracking and read results](track-online-behavior.md#set-up-website-tracking-and-read-results).

- **Quickly personalize emails using predefined dynamic text, without the need to know the underlying data structure**
    - With predefined dynamic text, marketers will have a quick list of the most commonly used tokens to select from. Marketers familiar with the data model can create and share additional tokens so that the rest of the team can focus on authoring content rather than learning database concepts.

- **Take action with your customers in more ways by raising triggers from a journey to run another journey or Power Automate flow**
    - Use custom triggers to link between journeys and between journeys and custom processes. A new journey tile will raise a trigger at any point in a customer journey. Any journey or Power Automate flows connected to the trigger run immediately run when a customer reaches the tile. This includes triggers used in exit criteria, goals, and if/then branches for journeys.

#### Monthly enhancements

##### Real-time marketing

- **Customer journeys**
    - Create customer journeys more quickly by defining only the minimum entry criteria when making a new journey.
    - Include multiple suppression segments in a journey, fine-tuning where users exit the journey.
    - Stop and edit custom events even if they are used in live journeys.
    - Developers can now include a unique identifier to correlate triggers between journeys. For example, if a customer places multiple, separate orders, multiple order confirmation journeys would be triggered. Previously, if the customer cancelled one of the orders (triggering an order cancellation event), they would receive cancellation emails from both order journeys they were a part of. Now, a developer can insert a correlation identifier into the trigger for each unique order. The identifier ensures that only the journey occurrence tied to the cancelled order sends the cancellation email. Learn more: [Correlate across custom triggers](real-time-marketing-correlate-triggers.md).
- **Marketing emails**
    - Add feature-rich links to emails by directly linking to documents stored in the asset library.
    - Link buttons and images to existing events and marketing pages in the Marketing app database without looking up the specific URL.

- **Event management**
    - Teams online event calendar invites include a 15-minute reminder before the event for attendees and speakers.

> [!NOTE]
> The outbound email editor now includes a deprecation warning that is only visible to users of pre-October 2021 versions of the Marketing app.

##### Global updates

- **Marketing emails**
    - Multiple email editor enhancements including easier element resizing and performance improvements.
    - Easily set equal heights for multi-column sections.

#### Bug fixes

- **Event management**
    - Contact matching now respects business unit scoping configurations.

    - Resolved an error that sometimes caused unsaved changes to appear even though no changes were made.
    - Email pre-headers are automatically generated and blank characters are removed, preventing pre-header-related errors.
    - Core CSS styles have been separated from customer CSS styles to improve rendering.
    - Resolved an error that caused local configs to fail when the remote configuration service is down.
    - Fixed an error that caused previously deduplicated contacts to be removed from deduplication storage after a failure and rollback.
    - Resolved an error related to custom envelope-from emails that caused "sync bounce" emails to resend as "remote bounce" emails, causing inaccurate email error reports.

## 2019 updates

### December 2019 update

The Dynamics 365 Marketing December 2019 update includes the previously announced send-now feature, plus several improvements for existing features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

#### Improved segmentation performance

Dynamics 365 Marketing now evaluates segment membership much more quickly than before. For simple segments, we now offer near-real-time evaluation. Complex segments, such as those that use relations or the TRAVERSE operator, are now processed up to four times faster. You'll now be able to see the full contact list on the **Members** tab much sooner than previously after going live with the segment.

#### Export dynamic segment members to Excel

You can now export the contacts that are members of a dynamic segment straight to an Excel file and with just a few clicks, no matter how large the segment is. To do it, open a live, dynamic segment, select **Related** > **Contacts** to add a **Contacts** tab; then select **Export Contacts** from the command bar for that tab and choose the Excel format you would like.

![Export segment members to Excel.](media/export-segment-members.png "Export segment members to Excel")

More information: [Export dynamic segment members to Excel](segments-export-members.md)

#### Template gallery for segments

You can now create a library of templates to make it fast and easy to create any of a variety commonly used segment queries. To help get you started, we provide a collection of common queries right out of the box, each of which provides both an example and a starting point for creating your own queries. Start by selecting a template that resembles the query you want to make, then customize as needed.

![Segment template gallery.](media/segment-template-gallery.png "Segment template gallery")

Each time you create a new segment you'll be presented with the **Segment templates** gallery, which resembles the galleries already provided for many other types of entities. Here you can browse, filter, search, and learn more about each listed template. Select **Cancel** to skip the templates and go to the standard new-segment hub, where you can select a basic segment type to build from scratch (as with previous versions of Dynamics 365 Marketing).

To create your own templates, you can save any existing segment as a template. Or go to **Marketing** > **Marketing templates** > **Segment templates** to browse, edit, or remove existing templates.

More information: [Work with segment templates](segments-templates.md)

#### Add visual labels to templates in the template galleries

When you design a new marketing email, page, form, or segment you are first presented with a gallery of templates to choose from. Now, you can add an eye-catching visual label to any template to make it easier to find and identify when browsing the gallery and other displays. For displays that use the tile view, each label appears as a colorful overlay for each relevant template. For displays using the grid view (list view), the labels can be displayed as column values, where they also show their configured colored background.

System customizers can create as many labels as you need, and define the display text and background color for each of them. In the following screenshot, you can see a tile view of marketing-page templates labeled with "New", "Old", and "VIP".

![Template gallery with labels in tile view.](media/template-label-example.png "Template gallery with labels in tile view")

More information: [Add visual labels for templates](email-templates.md#add-visual-labels-for-templates)

#### Quickly design and deliver a marketing email with _send now_

Dynamics 365 Marketing provides a flexible and powerful framework for designing interactive email campaigns comprised of target segments, marketing email messages, customer-journey automation, and more. But sometimes, when all you want to do is write a quick marketing email with simple personalization and send it to a few selected recipients, all of these extra components and capabilities can just get in the way. In this situation, use the new _send now_ feature, which lets you design an email as usual and then just select **Send now** to choose your recipients and deliver the message.

![Send-now ready announcement.](media/send-now-ready.png "Send-now ready announcement")

In the background, Dynamics 365 Marketing creates a static segment to contain your recipients, and a customer journey preconfigured to send your message to that segment. The journey goes live automatically and starts sending right away. After this, you can open the generated customer journey to view results and insights as usual. Both the segment and the journey that are generated by this feature are easy to identify because Dynamics 365 Marketing assigns them the same name as the email message that generated them.

More information: [Quickly design and deliver a marketing email with](email-send-now.md)

#### Add background images to sections in emails, forms, and pages

Section elements are used to establish the basic layout of your emails, marketing pages, and marketing forms. Each section offers a collection of formatting options, which already included options such as columns, background color, border style, padding, and margin. To this we now add the ability to show a background image, including fitting options such as stretch-to-fit and horizontal/vertical positioning. You can choose any image uploaded to the Dynamics 365 Marketing image gallery, or specify an external image-source URL.

![Section-element style settings.](media/section-element-bg.png "Section-element style settings")

More information: [Section (layout) elements](content-blocks-reference.md#section-layout-elements)

#### Preview: Set static expiry dates for email tiles in a customer journey

Some of your customer journeys may include email messages with time-sensitive content, such as a time-limited offer, holiday promotional, or a two-week reminder for an upcoming event. Because contacts might join the journey at any time, you can now prevent delivering outdated information by setting an expiration date for one or more selected email messages. Any contact who enters an email tile after its expiration date has past will simply pass through that tile without being sent the message.

![Journey email-tile expiration settings.](media/journey-email-expire.png "Journey email-tile expiration settings")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a preview feature, which means that it's available on all updated instances, but is turned off by default and shouldn't be enabled on production instances. Admins can easily enable or disable it as needed. See [the documentation](email-expire.md) for details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For this preview release, the feature may sometimes still deliver a message up to six days after the expiry date. This is due to delays and retries built into the delivery system, and should occur only extremely rarely. We expect to remove this possibility entirely for the final release. Additionally, you should only use this feature with commercial messages (not transactional messages).

More information: [Preview: Set expiration dates for selected email tiles in a customer journey](email-expire.md)

#### View form-visit and form-submission insights for marketing websites

The _marketing websites_ feature generates a JavaScript code that you can add to your website pages if you'd like to track page visits for use in reporting, contact evaluation, lead scoring, and more.

The feature already provided a list of page visits, each associated with a contact when possible (for known contacts with the right cookie). Now the feature also provides separate insights for visits to pages that include a marketing form, and for each submission of each form. The feature tracks both embedded and captured forms.

![Website form-submissions insights.](media/website-form-submit-insights.png "Website form-submissions insights")

More information: [Analyze results to gain insights from your marketing activities](insights.md)

#### Edit and resubmit forms to correct for errors or failures

Marketing-form records already provided a **Failed submissions** tab, where you could see each time the form was submitted but couldn't be processed--typically due to a technical issue, such as a non-existing ID for an option-set. Now we've made it possible to open any failed submission, correct any obvious data issues, and then resubmit it for processing.

We've also renamed this tab to **Form submissions** because now we've made it possible to include successfully processed submissions here too (optional). This lets you edit any failed _or successful_ submission and then resubmit it to update your database with or without generating a new interaction record for the resubmission.

![Edit and resubmit form submissions.](media/form-resubmit.png "Edit and resubmit form submissions")

> [!NOTE]
> You can always review successful, processed submissions by going to the **Insights** tab and opening the **Submissions** panel, but you can't resubmit from there.

More information: [Edit and resubmit form submissions](failed-submissions.md)

#### Bug fixes

- Customer journeys: The schedule tile now consistently holds contacts until the next permitted time window arrives.
- Marketing email designer: The designer now gracefully handles an HTML error that can occur when image element content is edited using the HTML editor.
- Marketing email designer: When using certain templates, the email designer no longer fails to save changes and thereafter show a blank page.
- Marketing email designer: The designer now correctly processes multiple undo/redo commands.
- Marketing email designer: When you change the **Hero image** using the **Style** settings for a message based on a supplied template, the delivered message now shows the updated image (previously, the original hero image was sometimes delivered instead).
- Email dynamic content: You can now include dynamic expressions that use two single quotes, one after the other (previously, these would be reduced to just one single quote).
- Email A/B testing: Undo and redo commands now work correctly when editing the A and B versions of an email-body test.
- Content blocks: Dynamics 365 Marketing instances that don't have marketing services installed (also known as _disconnected instances_) now correctly show content blocks as in draft state and correctly display the warning that marketing services are unavailable.
- Marketing pages: Users are now warned if they try to make changes to a live marketing page that could result in a blank page or a page where the form was removed.
- Marketing forms: You can now edit and submit form designs that were created by a user that has been deleted from the system.
- Form capture: Forms that include drop-down list values containing whitespace are now captured correctly
- Lead scoring: You can now include apostrophes in expression values for lead-scoring rules (they will be correctly escaped automatically).
- Segment designer: You can now create segments that find records with null values in two-option fields.
- Event website: Custom registration fields no longer show in-field placeholder text that matches the label (to avoid displaying long, repeated text in the form).

### November 2019 update

The Dynamics 365 Marketing November 2019 update provides several improvements for existing features, plus performance improvements and bug fixes.

#### A/B testing improvements

The A/B testing feature now freezes all test results when the test is finished. That means that when you're reviewing your A/B test KPIs, results, and insights, you'll only see information about what occurred during the test period (not afterwards).

For more information about this feature, see:

- [Email A/B testing](/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/dynamics365-marketing/email-ab-testing) (feature announcement)
- [Design and run A/B tests on your email designs](email-a-b-testing.md) (documentation)

#### Segmentation improvements

Segments now support many-to-many (N:N) relationships for custom entities, which means you can define segmentation criteria on entities that relate back to contacts through these types of relationships in addition to 1:N and N:1 relationships. Previously, a few specific N:N relationships were supported (such as between contacts and marketing lists), but these were hard-coded for specific scenarios. Now you can use N:N relationships in custom scenarios too.

For more information about this feature, see:

- [Improved segmentation experience](/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/dynamics365-marketing/improved-segmentation-experience) (feature announcement)
- [Working with segments](segmentation-lists-subscriptions.md) (documentation)

#### Customer journey insights improvements

Customer journeys provide detailed information about what occurred during the journey. Among the results presented on the **Insights** tab is the **Incomplete journey** panel, where you can see information about contacts who were stopped during the journey and emails that we blocked from being sent. Emails might be blocked for any of several reasons, which are listed here. For the November release, we've added an entry for **Other reasons**, where blocked emails that don't fall into any of the other available categories will be listed together with information about what happened.

For more information about this feature, see:

- [Customer journey insights](insights.md#customer-journey-insights) (documentation)

#### Bug fixes

The Dynamics 365 Marketing November 2019 update includes the following bug fixes:

- Installation and setup: The Dynamics 365 setup wizard now succeeds when some or all workflows, plugins, and/or entities were created by a now disabled or unlicensed user.
- Marketing pages: For double opt-in, content settings are now correctly validated to identify missing confirmation settings.
- Marketing pages: Test domains are no longer checked against block listed providers.
- Marketing pages: Subscription-center forms now correctly handle the "Do not bulk email me" option when presented either as a radio button or as a check box.
- Marketing pages: Form-submission error feedback is now customizable via JavaScript.
- Email marketing: Error checking now functions correctly when date/time fields are referenced in dynamic content.
- Customer journeys: Individual marketing lists can now be reused across multiple customer journeys.
- Websites: For website insights, the **Timeline** display has been renamed to **Visits**.
- Customer Insights: Deleted contacts now sync correctly and more quickly.

## December 2019 update

The Dynamics 365 Marketing December 2019 update includes the previously announced send-now feature, plus several improvements for existing features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

### Improved segmentation performance

Dynamics 365 Marketing now evaluates segment membership much more quickly than before. For simple segments, we now offer near-real-time evaluation. Complex segments, such as those that use relations or the TRAVERSE operator, are now processed up to four times faster. You'll now be able to see the full contact list on the **Members** tab much sooner than previously after going live with the segment.

### Export dynamic segment members to Excel

You can now export the contacts that are members of a dynamic segment straight to an Excel file and with just a few clicks, no matter how large the segment is. To do it, open a live, dynamic segment, select **Related** > **Contacts** to add a **Contacts** tab; then select **Export Contacts** from the command bar for that tab and choose the Excel format you would like.

![Export segment members to Excel](media/export-segment-members.png "Export segment members to Excel")

More information: [Export dynamic segment members to Excel](segments-export-members.md)

### Template gallery for segments

You can now create a library of templates to make it fast and easy to create any of a variety commonly used segment queries. To help get you started, we provide a collection of common queries right out of the box, each of which provides both an example and a starting point for creating your own queries. Start by selecting a template that resembles the query you want to make, then customize as needed.

![Segment template gallery](media/segment-template-gallery.png "Segment template gallery")

Each time you create a new segment you'll be presented with the **Segment templates** gallery, which resembles the galleries already provided for many other types of entities. Here you can browse, filter, search, and learn more about each listed template. Select **Cancel** to skip the templates and go to the standard new-segment hub, where you can select a basic segment type to build from scratch (as with previous versions of Dynamics 365 Marketing).

To create your own templates, you can save any existing segment as a template. Or go to **Marketing** > **Marketing templates** > **Segment templates** to browse, edit, or remove existing templates.

### Add visual labels to templates in the template galleries

When you design a new marketing email, page, form, or segment you are first presented with a gallery of templates to choose from. Now, you can add an eye-catching visual label to any template to make it easier to find and identify when browsing the gallery and other displays. For displays that use the tile view, each label appears as a colorful overlay for each relevant template. For displays using the grid view (list view), the labels can be displayed as column values, where they also show their configured colored background.

System customizers can create as many labels as you need, and define the display text and background color for each of them. In the following screenshot, you can see a tile view of marketing-page templates labeled with "New", "Old", and "VIP".

### Quickly design and deliver a marketing email with _send now_

Dynamics 365 Marketing provides a flexible and powerful framework for designing interactive email campaigns comprised of target segments, marketing email messages, customer-journey automation, and more. But sometimes, when all you want to do is write a quick marketing email with simple personalization and send it to a few selected recipients, all of these extra components and capabilities can just get in the way. In this situation, use the new _send now_ feature, which lets you design an email as usual and then just select **Send now** to choose your recipients and deliver the message.

![Send-now ready announcement](media/send-now-ready.png "Send-now ready announcement")

In the background, Dynamics 365 Marketing creates a static segment to contain your recipients, and a customer journey preconfigured to send your message to that segment. The journey goes live automatically and starts sending right away. After this, you can open the generated customer journey to view results and insights as usual. Both the segment and the journey that are generated by this feature are easy to identify because Dynamics 365 Marketing assigns them the same name as the email message that generated them.

### Add background images to sections in emails, forms, and pages

Section elements are used to establish the basic layout of your emails, marketing pages, and marketing forms. Each section offers a collection of formatting options, which already included options such as columns, background color, border style, padding, and margin. To this we now add the ability to show a background image, including fitting options such as stretch-to-fit and horizontal/vertical positioning. You can choose any image uploaded to the Dynamics 365 Marketing image gallery, or specify an external image-source URL.

### Preview: Set static expiry dates for email tiles in a customer journey

Some of your customer journeys may include email messages with time-sensitive content, such as a time-limited offer, holiday promotional, or a two-week reminder for an upcoming event. Because contacts might join the journey at any time, you can now prevent delivering outdated information by setting an expiration date for one or more selected email messages. Any contact who enters an email tile after its expiration date has past will simply pass through that tile without being sent the message.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a preview feature, which means that it's available on all updated instances, but is turned off by default and shouldn't be enabled on production instances. Admins can easily enable or disable it as needed. See [the documentation](email-expire.md) for details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For this preview release, the feature may sometimes still deliver a message up to six days after the expiry date. This is due to delays and retries built into the delivery system, and should occur only extremely rarely. We expect to remove this possibility entirely for the final release. Additionally, you should only use this feature with commercial messages (not transactional messages).

### View form-visit and form-submission insights for marketing websites

The _marketing websites_ feature generates a JavaScript code that you can add to your website pages if you'd like to track page visits for use in reporting, contact evaluation, lead scoring, and more.

The feature already provided a list of page visits, each associated with a contact when possible (for known contacts with the right cookie). Now the feature also provides separate insights for visits to pages that include a marketing form, and for each submission of each form. The feature tracks both embedded and captured forms.

More information: [Analyze results to gain insights from your marketing activities](insights.md)

### Edit and resubmit forms to correct for errors or failures

Marketing-form records already provided a **Failed submissions** tab, where you could see each time the form was submitted but couldn't be processed--typically due to a technical issue, such as a non-existing ID for an option-set. Now we've made it possible to open any failed submission, correct any obvious data issues, and then resubmit it for processing.

We've also renamed this tab to **Form submissions** because now we've made it possible to include successfully processed submissions here too (optional). This lets you edit any failed _or successful_ submission and then resubmit it to update your database with or without generating a new interaction record for the resubmission.

![Edit and resubmit form submissions](media/form-resubmit.png "Edit and resubmit form submissions")

> [!NOTE]
> You can always review successful, processed submissions by going to the **Insights** tab and opening the **Submissions** panel, but you can't resubmit from there.

More information: [Edit and resubmit form submissions](failed-submissions.md)

### Bug fixes

- Customer journeys: The schedule tile now consistently holds contacts until the next permitted time window arrives.
- Marketing email designer: The designer now gracefully handles an HTML error that can occur when image element content is edited using the HTML editor.
- Marketing email designer: When using certain templates, the email designer no longer fails to save changes and thereafter show a blank page.
- Marketing email designer: The designer now correctly processes multiple undo/redo commands.

- Email dynamic content: You can now include dynamic expressions that use two single quotes, one after the other (previously, these would be reduced to just one single quote).
- Email A/B testing: Undo and redo commands now work correctly when editing the A and B versions of an email-body test.
- Content blocks: Dynamics 365 Marketing instances that don't have marketing services installed (also known as _disconnected instances_) now correctly show content blocks as in draft state and correctly display the warning that marketing services are unavailable.
- Marketing pages: Users are now warned if they try to make changes to a live marketing page that could result in a blank page or a page where the form was removed.
- Marketing forms: You can now edit and submit form designs that were created by a user that has been deleted from the system.
- Form capture: Forms that include drop-down list values containing whitespace are now captured correctly
- Lead scoring: You can now include apostrophes in expression values for lead-scoring rules (they will be correctly escaped automatically).
- Segment designer: You can now create segments that find records with null values in two-option fields.
- Event website: Custom registration fields no longer show in-field placeholder text that matches the label (to avoid displaying long, repeated text in the form).

## November 2019 update

The Dynamics 365 Marketing November 2019 update provides several improvements for existing features, plus performance improvements and bug fixes.

### A/B testing improvements

The A/B testing feature now freezes all test results when the test is finished. That means that when you're reviewing your A/B test KPIs, results, and insights, you'll only see information about what occurred during the test period (not afterwards).

For more information about this feature, see:

- [Email A/B testing](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/dynamics365-marketing/email-ab-testing) (feature announcement)
- [Design and run A/B tests on your email designs](email-a-b-testing.md) (documentation)

### Segmentation improvements

Segments now support many-to-many (N:N) relationships for custom entities, which means you can define segmentation criteria on entities that relate back to contacts through these types of relationships in addition to 1:N and N:1 relationships. Previously, a few specific N:N relationships were supported (such as between contacts and marketing lists), but these were hard-coded for specific scenarios. Now you can use N:N relationships in custom scenarios too.

For more information about this feature, see:

- [Improved segmentation experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/dynamics365-marketing/improved-segmentation-experience) (feature announcement)
- [Working with segments](segmentation-lists-subscriptions.md) (documentation)

### Customer journey insights improvements

Customer journeys provide detailed information about what occurred during the journey. Among the results presented on the **Insights** tab is the **Incomplete journey** panel, where you can see information about contacts who were stopped during the journey and emails that we blocked from being sent. Emails might be blocked for any of several reasons, which are listed here. For the November release, we've added an entry for **Other reasons**, where blocked emails that don't fall into any of the other available categories will be listed together with information about what happened.

For more information about this feature, see:

- [Customer journey insights](insights.md#customer-journey-insights) (documentation)

# Real-time marketing overview

Dynamics 365 Marketing isn't just for marketers anymore. With AI and natural language input assistance, business users can build event-based journeys that reach customers across multiple touch-points, growing relationships from prospects, through sales and support. Dynamics 365 Marketingâ€™s real-time marketing features enable organizations to:

- **Engage customers in real-time**

  With features such as [event-based customer journeys](real-time-marketing-event-based-journey.md), [custom triggers](real-time-marketing-custom-events.md), and [SMS](real-time-marketing-outbound-text-messaging.md) and [push notifications](real-time-marketing-push-notifications.md), organizations can trigger customer journeys in real time, pick the right channel for each individual, and react to customer-led actions in the moments that matter.

- **Win customers and earn loyalty faster**

  Working across all customer touchpoints, real-time customer journeys are truly an end-to-end experience.

- **Personalize customer experiences with AI**

  Turn insights into relevant action with AI-driven recommendations for content, channels, and analytics. 

  [Customer Insights segment and profile integration](real-time-marketing-ci-profile.md) allows organizations to seamlessly leverage the deep customer understanding in Customer Insights.

- **Grow with a unified, adaptable platform**

  Easily customize and connect with tools you already use.

  Efficiently manage compliance requirements and accessibility guidelines.

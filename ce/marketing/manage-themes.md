# Use themes to customize the appearance of your app

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Change the color scheme of the user interface based on your preferences, or create your own branding by changing the color scheme or logo in [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)]. You can create a theme&mdash;a custom look and feel&mdash;for your app by creating new themes with  colors and visual elements you choose.

The theme colors are applied globally throughout the application. For example, you can enhance the following visual elements:

- Product logos
- Nav Bar Color&mdash;the background color of the navigation bar
- Main Color&mdash;the color of the command bar, buttons, and tabs
- Accent Color&mdash;the color of the process bar

## Apply a new theme

[!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] includes three default themes. You can choose one of these default themes, or pick any custom theme that you created.

To apply a theme, select the theme in the **Select Theme** drop-down list, and select **Save and Apply Theme**.

The theme that you are currently using is shown with the text "currently applied."

## Create a new theme

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Branding & Theme**.
1. Select **Create new theme**.
1. In the **Theme Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the new theme.
1. To change the logo, select **Edit** in the logo box, and then choose an image file of type JPG, PNG, GIF, or SVG. The image file is converted to a web resource.<br>
    To revert to the default [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] logo, select **Restore default logo**.
1. Enter a tooltip for the logo.
1. Choose the colors you want in the **Nav Bar Color**, **Main Color**, and **Accent Color** boxes.
1. Select **Save and Apply Theme**.

# Decide whether to install Dynamics 365 for Marketing with or without a Dynamics 365 portal

Read this topic to learn how you can run interactive marketing features for Dynamics 365 for Marketing by using an integrated Dynamics 365 portal or by using your own website or CMS system.

## How portal integration affects Marketing features

Dynamics 365 for Marketing provides several features that enable contacts to interact directly with the system. These are:

- **Landing pages**, which provide forms that contacts can use to register for mailing lists, free downloads, webinars, or other perks
- **Subscription centers**, which enable contacts to manage their mailing list subscriptions and personal information
- **Forwarding pages**, which enable contacts to forward marketing emails they have received from you (while preserving accurate tracking info)
- **The event website**, which enables contacts to read about and register for your events

Each of these features requires one or more webpages that are available publicly on the internet. Each page must furthermore be able to fetch information from Dynamics 365 for Marketing and also be able to submit data back to it. There are two ways to accomplish this:

- **Use Dynamics 365 portals**: This option is based on a Dynamics 365 add-on product that runs directly on the same tenant as your Dynamics 365 for Marketing instance. It enables  you to go live with Marketing without needing to manage or modify your own website. 
- **Use your own website or CMS system**: This option requires that you have your own website where you can host pages, add scripts, and embed forms from Dynamics 365 for Marketing. You can use this option in parallel with a Dynamics 365 portal if you wish.

The following table compares how each of the public-facing interactive features works when you implement it using a Dynamics 365 portal or your own website.

## Choose whether to use a portal when setting up a new Marketing instance

Each time you install Dynamics 365 for Marketing, you must choose whether or not to integrate it with a portal. 

To use a portal, you must have a separate Dynamics 365 portals license for each Dynamics 365 for Marketing instance that uses portal features. A free portals license is provided with Dynamics 365 for Marketing, but you can only have [one free portal per tenant](setup-troubleshooting.md#why-portal), so you must purchase additional portals licenses if you want to use a portal with more than one Dynamics 365 instance on your tenant. 

If you choose the non-portals option, then you'll be able to complete the Marketing setup even without an unconfigured portal available.

You can use portal features in parallel with website/CMS features provided you have a portal. You could, for example, start by using a portal for all interactive features and then slowly transition to an external website until you're ready to remove the portal entirely.

For complete details about how to run the setup wizard, including how to choose whether or not to set up portal integration, see [Run the setup wizard](purchase-setup.md).

## Remove portal integration from an existing Marketing instance

You can choose to remove portal integration from a Dynamics 365 for Marketing instance at any time. If you choose to do so, the following will occur:

- Your portal license will be released and can then be reused with another Marketing instance, or another Customer Engagement app.
- All of the existing portal content and settings will be permanently deleted.
- All existing marketing pages in Dynamics 365 for Marketing will still be configured to be published on the now removed portal, so they will cease to function. However, their design and content will still be stored in Dynamics 365 for Marketing. If you re-add a portal, the pages will be reconfigured to use the new portal and you'll be able to publish them there.
- The event website will be removed. All events will still provide a link to the old website, so that link will no longer function. If you install the event website on your own server, it will work correctly right away (you won't have to update your event records), but if you want the links in your event records to open the new site, you must edit each record manually.

To remove portal integration from an existing Marketing instance, simply reset it as described in [Reset a portal](../portals/reset-portal.md).

After removing the portal, you should recreate your landing pages and subscription centers on your external website as needed, and design your customer journeys, [content settings](dynamic-email-content.md#content-settings), and email messages to link to them there. If you're using event management, then you should also install the event management website on your external server.

> [!NOTE]
> If you initially installed Marketing with portal integration enabled, then you did not receive a [default subscription center](set-up-subscription-center.md#default-center) (which otherwise would be running on the service fabric of your Marketing instance). You still won't have one after you remove the portal integration, and you can't create one here. You must therefore create at least one subscription center on your external website and configure your [content settings](dynamic-email-content.md#content-settings) to link to it.

## Add portal integration to an existing Marketing instance

You can choose to add (or re-add) a portal to a Marketing instance at any time. When you do this, the following will occur:

- All of your external marketing pages and external event website will continue to function.
- If you initially installed Marketing with portal integration disabled, then you should have a default [default subscription center](set-up-subscription-center.md#default-center) (which runs on the service fabric of your Marketing instance). It will continue to be available even after you add the portal.
- If you have any portal-based marketing page designs left over in your system from a previous portals integration, these will be reconfigured to use the new portal automatically.

To add a portal to an existing Marketing installation that doesn't have one:

1. Make sure you have an unconfigured portal available on your tenant. Purchase a new one if necessary.
1. Launch the [Dynamics 365 for Marketing setup wizard](purchase-setup.md#step-1-launch-the-setup-wizard).
1. On the first page of the wizard, do the following:
    - Select the Dynamics 365 organization that you want to add the portal to.
    - Select **Use Dynamics 365 Portals**
    - Enter a prefix for your portal URL in the field provided. Your contacts and customers can see the URL when they open a portal, so you should choose a subdomain name that they will recognize, such as your organization's name.

    ![Choose an organization and name your portal](media/setup-form-1.png "Choose an organization and name your portal")

1. Continue to work through the wizard following the instructions on your screen.

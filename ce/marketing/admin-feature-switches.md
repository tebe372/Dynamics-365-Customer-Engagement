# Use feature switches to enable or disable optional features

Use the **Feature switches** page to enable or disable optional features in Dynamics 365 Marketing. Currently, the only feature available here is business unit scoping. To enable or disable this feature:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Advanced settings** > **Other settings** > **Feature switches**.
1. Set the **Business unit scoping** slider to **On** to turn the feature on, or to **Off** to turn it off.

For details about how business units work in Dynamics 365 Marketing and how this setting affects them, see [Use business units to control access to Marketing records](business-units.md).

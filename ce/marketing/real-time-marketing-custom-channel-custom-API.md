# Define your custom APIs

## A. Outbound custom API

### Applicable channels: SMS, Custom

#### Why you need it:

A [custom API](/learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/custom-api) needs to be defined so that it will be called during the Journey runtime in Marketing. It's the entry point for custom code execution.   The Custom API will then call the Provider’s APIs. This API must accept the contract defined by the Marketing Journey and return the response. This custom API will be assigned to attribute **msdyn_outboundendpointurltemplate** at the [channel definition step](real-time-marketing-channel-definition.md).

#### How to define it:

The contract that the custom API should implement must have one input parameter (payload) and one output attribute (response)

- The payload is a serialized JSON with the following contract:
    - ChannelDefinitionId: GUID – The channel definition ID
    - RequestId: string – The request ID
    - From: string – The Sender (Channel Instance)
    - To: string – The recipient
    - Message: Dictionary <string, string> - Contains all the message parts for a channel. Keys are the message part names, I.e., values of the corresponding msdyn_name attribute.

- The response is a serialized JSON with the following contract:
    - ChannelDefinitionId: GUID – The channel definition ID
    - MessageId:  string – The message ID
    - RequestId: string – The request ID 
    - StatusDetails: Dictionary<string, object> - Channel specific information regarding the status.
    - Status: string – Possible Values are:
        - NotSent – there was an attempt to execute the submission to the provider, but it was rejected without a possibility to retry 
        - Sent – the submission request was successfully accepted by the provider
        - Delivered – the accepted message was successfully delivered to the target
        - NotDelivered – the accepted message was not successfully delivered to the target 

## B. Delivery report custom API

### Applicable channels: SMS, Custom

#### Why you need it:

If your channel supports delivery reports or statuses for messages, such as for example, “Delivered”, a [custom API](/learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/custom-api) needs to be defined. Your API will be called by the Provider and it must call the base solution’s **msdyn_D365ChannelsNotification** API. The latter will proxy the information back to Dataverse. This information will become available in Marketing Analytics.

#### How to define it:

Your own Custom API will be executed and call the msdyn_D365ChannelsNotification API with contract  as one input parameter:

- notificationPayLoad is a serialized JSON  with the following contract
    - ChannelDefinitionId: GUID – The channel Definition ID
    - RequestId: string – The Request ID
    - MessageId:  string – The message ID
    - From: string – The sender (channel instance)
    - OrganizationId: string – The organization ID
    - Status: string – The delivery report status 
    - StatusDetails: Dictionary <string, object> - Channel specific information regarding the status.

## C. Inbound custom API

### Applicable channels: SMS

#### Why you need it:

If your channel supports inbound requests, a [custom API](/learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/custom-api) needs to be defined. Your API will be called by the Provider and it must call the base solution’s **msdyn_D365ChannelsInbound** API. The latter will proxy the information back to Dataverse. 

#### How to define it:

Your own Custom API will be executed and call the **msdyn_D365ChannelsInbound** API with **contract** as 1 input parameter. The inboundPayload is proxied to the Channel Definition Inbound API.

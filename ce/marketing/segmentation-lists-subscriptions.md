# Working with segments

Use segments to establish groups of related contacts that you can target with your customer journeys.

> [!NOTE]
> *Marketing segments* are different than *marketing lists*. More information: [Marketing segments vs. marketing lists](segments-vs-lists.md)

## Segments in Dynamics 365 Marketing

A market segment is the collection of contacts that you target with a customer journey. In some cases, you'll simply target all the contacts you have, but in most cases, you'll choose who you want to target based on demographic or firmographic data and other considerations. For example, if you're opening a new store in San Francisco, you'll probably promote the opening-day event at that store only to contacts who live near San Francisco. Or if you're running a sale on dresses, you might only send related marketing email messages to your contacts who are female. Decisions like these will typically also affect the way you communicate with the segment in terms of which channels you'll choose, what kind of graphics you'll pick, which kinds of arguments you make, and more.

Dynamics 365 Marketing uses segments to target customer journeys. Most customer journeys start with a segment tile, which establishes the collection of contacts who will experience that journey. You can combine multiple segments here.

### Types of segments

Segments can be dynamic, static, or compound.

- *Dynamic segments* are set up by using logical expressions, such as "all contacts from New York" or "all contacts who like The Mets." Membership in dynamic segments changes constantly to reflect new or removed contacts and updated contact information.
- *Static segments* establish a static list of contacts who are selected on a per-contact basis rather than created logically based on field values. Marketers and salespeople might create and populate a static list based on private knowledge or offline interactions.
- *Compound segments* combine existing (live) segments using logical operators.

Segments can also be based either on profiles or interactions.

- *Profile segments* query the _profile_ records stored in the marketing-insights service. Profiles records are synced between your Dynamics 365 organizational database and the marketing-insights service, and include the entities you normally work with in the Dynamics 365 UI, such as contacts, accounts, leads, and any other entities that you [choose to sync](mkt-settings-sync.md).
- *Interaction segments* query the _interaction_ records stored in the marketing-insights service. Each of these records is generated automatically and related to a specific contact record. Interaction records are accessed to generate various insights displays in the Dynamics 365 Marketing UI, but they _aren't_ synced to the Dynamics 365 organizational database. They are generated in response to contact interactions such as opening an email, clicking an email link, submitting a form, or registering for an event.

### Segments are synced with the marketing-insights service

Dynamics 365 Marketing works together with the marketing-insights service, which operates using its own marketing-insights database to provide advanced segment definitions and customer analytics. The integration is seamless and results in powerful combined functionality when the two systems work together. Your contact records and marketing lists are continuously synchronized between the two systems, which lets the marketing-insights service apply its powerful data processing and analytical tools to your contacts, and combine these with information from other types of Dynamics 365 records.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The marketing-insights service processes changes to segment membership asynchronously, which means you can't predict the order in which changes are processed. In some cases, such as when processing very large databases, it can take up to six hours for a given segment to get updated. You therefore can't rely on any one segment being processed before or after a specific other segment, so be careful when orchestrating related campaigns and/or using  [suppression segments](customer-journeys-create-automated-campaigns.md#suppression-segment).

### Segments must be live before you can use them

When you first create a new segment, it is in a _draft_ state, which means that it is unlocked, so you can work with its definition and other settings, but you won't be able to use it in customer journeys or compound segments. When you are ready to use your segment, you must open it and select **Go Live** from the command bar, which enables it and moves to the _live_ state.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While you are designing your segment, you can select the **Get estimated segment size** link to get an *estimate* for the number of contacts that will be included in the segment. Usually the estimate will be exact, but sometimes the final size may vary slightly (you must go live with the segment to view its exact size and membership).

If you need to edit a segment after it has gone live, open it and then select **Stop** from the command bar to put it back into the draft state.

## View, create, and manage your segments

To work with your segments, go to **Marketing** &gt; **Customers** &gt; **Segments**. This opens a standard list view, which you can use to search, sort, filter, create, and delete your segments. Open any segment to view its details, or select **New** to create a new one.

![The General tab for segments](media/segment-general.png "The General tab for segments")

Segment records provide several tabs for describing, defining, and reviewing the segment. Tabs are shown as a set of headings under the header, which shows the name of the segment. Select any of these headings to go to the relevant tab. Each tab is described briefly in the following subsections.

### The General tab

The **General** tab provides general information about the segment, including:

- **Name**: Enter a name that will make the segment easy for you and others to identify while working in Dynamics 365.
- **Segment Type**: Set the segment to dynamic, static, or compound. This setting controls which types of settings you'll see for populating the list on the **Definition** tab.
- **Status reason**: Shows whether the segment is draft or live. Only live segments are available for use in customer journeys and compound segments.

### The Definition tab

Use the **Definition** tab to establish membership of the segment. For dynamic segments, you'll get a query builder here. For static segments, you'll select specific contacts one at a time. For compound segments, you'll create logic for combining existing segments here. For more information about how to build your segment definition using this tab, see the following topics:

- [Design profile-based dynamic segments](segments-profile.md)
- [Design interaction-based dynamic segments](segments-interaction.md)
- [Define a static segment](segments-static.md)
- [Combine segments into a compound segment](segments-compound.md)

### The Members tab

The **Members** tab is only shown after you segment has gone live at least once. Use it to see which contacts are part of the segment. It typically takes a few minutes for the **Members** tab to populate after you go live with a segment.

### The Insights tab

Many types of entities, including segments, show a tab labelled **Insights**  after a record has gone live at least once. This tab shows results, analytics, KPIs and other information about how that record has been used and how contacts have interacted with it.

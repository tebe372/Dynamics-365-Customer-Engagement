# Quota management

[!INCLUDE[Pre-release disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] is a subscription service that is billed monthly based on the number of licensed users. Your license also sets organization-level quotas for the maximum number of contact records and monthly marketing email messages you can send. You can always upgrade your license if you need higher quotas. The **Quota Management** page shows the total quota levels you have licensed and how much of each quota your organization has already used.

To find this information, go to **Settings** > **Quota Management** > **Settings**.

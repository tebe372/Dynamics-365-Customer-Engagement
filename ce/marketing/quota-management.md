# Quota limits

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The quota limits page is under construction. Litmus inbox previews and Customer Voice survey limits are temporarily unavailable but will be back soon.

Dynamics 365 Marketing is a subscription service that is billed monthly and sets organization-level quotas for the maximum number of marketing contact records and monthly outbound interactions that you can send. Other quotas may also apply. You can always upgrade your subscription if you need higher quotas. The **Quota limits** page shows the total quota levels you have purchased and how much of each quota your organization has already used.

To see how much of each quota you've used, go to **Settings** > **Overview** > **Quota limits**.

The following quotas are tracked here:

- **Marketing interactions**: Shows the total number of outbound interactions (email messages, SMS, push) that you can still send this month and the total number you have sent. Your interaction quota is equal to ten times your marketing contacts quota.
- **Marketing contacts**: Shows the total number of *marketing contacts* that you can have in your database according to your current Dynamics 365 Marketing subscription. Marketing contacts only include those that you engage with through interactions such as emails, SMS, push notifications. Contacts that you never engage in marketing activities won't be counted as part of this quota. For more information about marketing contacts and how they are counted, see [How Marketing is licensed](purchase-setup.md#how-licensed) and the [Administration and setup FAQ](setup-troubleshooting.yml#licensing)

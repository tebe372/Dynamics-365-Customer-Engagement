# Quota management

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] is a subscription service that is billed monthly and sets organization-level quotas for the maximum number of marketing contact records, Litmus previews, and monthly marketing email messages you can send. Other quotas may also apply. You can always upgrade your subscription if you need higher quotas. The **Quota Management** page shows the total quota levels you have purchased and how much of each quota your organization has already used.

To find this information, go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings** > **Others** > **Quota Limits**. The following quotas are tracked here:

- **Email**: Shows the total number of email messages you can still send this month, and the total number you have sent.
- **Litmus**: Shows the total number of Litmus email previews (inbox previews) to can still request this month, and the total number you have used. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use the advanced inbox preview feature](prepare-marketing-emails.md#inbox-preview)
- **Contact**: Shows the total number of *marketing contacts* that you can have in your database according to your current [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] subscription. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Purchase a production version of Dynamics 365 for Marketing](purchase-marketing.md) and the [Administration and setup FAQ](setup-troubleshooting.md#licensing)

# Install add-ons

Add-ons are optional components that can be installed on your Dynamics 365 Marketing instance. Add-ons extend or further improve the default functionality of a specific area.

To install or uninstall an add-on, you need the following privileges:

- Read = ability to see the add-on on the add-on page
- Create = ability to install the add-on
- Delete = ability to uninstall the add-on

## Add-ons

### Asset library add-on

The asset library add-on provides access to additional file types, automated tagging, smart image recommendations, and file quota that is not counted towards Dataverse file storage. Learn more: [Install the real-time marketing asset library add-on](real-time-marketing-asset-add-on.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Business units, security roles, and application lifecycle management for assets are not currently supported by the asset library add-on.

# Install add-ons

Add-ons are optional components that can be installed to your Dynamics 365 Marketing instance. Add-ons extend or further improve default functionality of a specific area.

To install or uninstall an add-on, user will have to have sufficient privileges granted as follows:

- Read = ability to see the add-on on the add-on page
- Create = ability to install the add-on
- Delete = ability to uninstall the add-on

## Add-ons

### Asset library add-on

The asset library add-on provides access to additional file types, automated tagging, smart image recommendations, and file quota not counted towards Dataverse file storage. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/marketing/real-time-marketing-asset-add-on)

**Note:** Business units, security roles, and application lifecycle management for assets are not supported in asset library add-on at present.

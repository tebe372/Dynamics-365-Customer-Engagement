# Install add-ons

[!INCLUDE[consolidated-sku-rtm-only](../includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

Add-ons are optional components that can be installed on your Dynamics 365 Marketing instance. Add-ons extend or further improve the default functionality of a specific area.

To install or uninstall an add-on, you need the following privileges:

- Read = ability to see the add-on on the add-on page
- Create = ability to install the add-on
- Delete = ability to uninstall the add-on

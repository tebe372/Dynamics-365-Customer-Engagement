      - question: |
          How are automatic upgrades rolled out for Dynamics 365 Marketing?
        answer: |
          Marketing solution upgrades are typically available during the first week of the month, except in April and October where we follow the Dynamics 365 Platform release cadence. Organizations receive automatic upgrades throughout the month on a rolling basis. The exact date automatic upgrades are pushed varies by global region. To ensure minimal service disruption, upgrades occur during periods of low traffic for the hosting geographical region.

      - question: |
          How can customers determine when their Marketing solution will be upgraded?
        answer: |
          We send Marketing administrators an admin center notification at least five days prior to the earliest date the organization will receive an upgrade. The notification does not mean the upgrade will occur on an exact date. The purpose of the notification is so that, if they choose, customers can schedule a manual upgrade at their discretion before the system pushes the automatic upgrade.

      - question: |
          How can I request to defer an automatic upgrade?
        answer: |
          Keeping Marketing up to date ensures that customers enjoy the most recent features and bug fixes. We understand, however, that business needs sometimes require holding off on an upgrade. For a one-off request to defer an upgrade, contact [Dynamics 365 Marketing Update Policy](mailto:D365MKTUpdatePolicy@microsoft.com).
          
      - question: |
          How can customers ensure the upgrade order for their organizations?
        answer: |
          Upgrades are delivered by our system automatically. We cannot guarantee the order of upgrades between organizations. For customers who want to upgrade certain organizations before others, we recommend upgrading the organizations manually following the procedures in [Keep Marketing up to date](apply-updates.md).

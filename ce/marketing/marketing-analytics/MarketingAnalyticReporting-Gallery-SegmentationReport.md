# Segmentation usage report

> [!TIP]
> With the marketing segmentation usage report, you can analyze how segments are used across your marketing activities.

The marketing segment usage report shows which segments are used in which marketing activities and helps you to identify orphaned segments.

## Leaderboard and segmentation usage report

The leaderboard report helps you identify the most-used segments and the journeys that use the most segments.

## Orphaned segmentation  report

The orphaned segment report identifies segments that are not used anywhere. We recommend that you regularly clean up your unused segments to prevent clutter and reserve your processing resources for segments that you actually use.

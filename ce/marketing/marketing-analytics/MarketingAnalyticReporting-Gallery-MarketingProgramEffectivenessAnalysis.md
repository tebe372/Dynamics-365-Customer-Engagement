Each group shows the number of opportunities, the total project budget amount for the opportunities in this group, the estimated revenue and the actual total amount. 
The group association is done through the originating leads based on whether those originate from customer journeys, marketing pages, or sales campaigns.
The first block are the opportunities that originate from Sales campaigns. The second block aggregates all opportunities that originate from inbound marketing - they have been created from an inbound visit on a marketing page but without that an outbound customer journey could be attributed to the lead. The third are all the opportunities that have been attributed to a customer journeys.
This reports assumes all customer journeys to be outbound. But you can consider extending your journey model data with inbound vs. outbound  classification and associate respective opportunities accordingly - if this is relevant for your marketing automation configuration.

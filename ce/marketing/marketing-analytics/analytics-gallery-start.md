## Connect a Power BI template to your Dynamics 365 Marketing instance

After your Azure Blob storage is [set up and connected to Dynamics 365 Marketing](../custom-analytics.md), you're ready to start working in Power BI to connect to your data sources and design your analytics.

1. If you haven't done so already, download the templates you need from the gallery.

1. Select a template and open it in Power BI Desktop. If you don't already have Power BI Desktop, you can download it for free from [https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

1. The first time you open a Power BI template, you'll be asked to specify connection strings and credentials to connect to both Azure Blob storage and to Dynamics 365 Marketing.

    ![The connection dialog for connecting your Power BI template to the relevant data sources](../media/custom-analytics-pbi-connect.png "The connection dialog for connecting your Power BI template to the relevant data sources")

    - To connect to the Dynamics 365 database, use the same user credentials that you use to sign in to Marketing.
    - You can [find connection details for your Azure Blob storage](../custom-analytics.md#connect-blob) by using Azure Storage Explorer.
    - Specify how many days of interaction data that you want to load (counting back from today).

1. Select **Load** to load the template into Power BI.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you see loading errors the first time you open a template, open the query editor, select a query that has been highlighted with a warning icon, and then select **Retry** on the notification message bar. Repeat for each query that shows a warning. After all queries have loaded, select **Close & Apply**.

Dynamics 365 Marketing offers to types of data: *profiles* and *interactions*.

- **Profiles** correspond to the entity types that are modeled in the Dynamics 365 organization database. These get reflected into the Common Data Model and can be accessed through the access point to the Common Data Services.

- **Interactions** are all the signals that Dynamics 365 Marketing captures as it runs a customer journey, reaches out to your audience, and listens and responds to their activities. Dynamics 365 Marketing allows you to continuously extract those interactions into your own Azure Blob Storage. You can then configure Power BI reports to use this data.

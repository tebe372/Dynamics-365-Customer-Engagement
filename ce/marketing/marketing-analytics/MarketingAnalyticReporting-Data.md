Dynamics 365 Marketing offers to types of data: Profiles and Interactions

**Profiles** correspond to the entity types that are modeled in the Dynamics 365 organization database. These get reflected into the Common Data Model and can be accessed through the access point to the Common Data Services.

**Interactions** are all the signals that Dynamics 365 Marketing captures when it runs the customer journeys, reaches out to your audience and listens and responds to the activities from the marketing audience. Dynamics 365 Marketing allows you to continuously extract those interactions into your own Azure Blob Storage and you can then configure Power BI reports to use this data.

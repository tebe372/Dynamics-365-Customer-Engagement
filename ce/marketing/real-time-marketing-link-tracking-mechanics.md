# Real-time marketing link tracking mechanics

When executing customer journeys, all relevant hyperlinks are replaced with trackable links. If the content of a message is HTML, we also create an invisible pixel inside the message body. The invisible pixel is necessary to determine whether a user clicked on a link or opened the message.

Replaced links have the following format: 

`https://[geo-specific].dynamics.com/api/orgs/[hashed organization-identifier]/r/[link identifier]`

Links are replaced when the following conditions are met:

 - The links are not marked as **non-trackable** inside the message editor
 - The recipient customer profile indicates that the customer has consented to tracking

When the recipient clicks on a link or opens a message with a tracking pixel, two things happen:

 - The recipient is redirected to the original URL
 - The link click interaction is recorded
 
If the recipient has opted-out from tracking, the interaction is generated as anonymous. When the recipient has opted-out, the interaction does not store a customer profile reference.
 
> [!NOTE]
> All links generated on the text message channel are shortened, regardless of whether they are replaced with tracking links.

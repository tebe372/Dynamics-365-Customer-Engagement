# About the Preview

[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] is offered as a Preview.

A Preview is a feature or service that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially released so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Previews aren’t meant for production use or use with personal data and may have limited or restricted functionality. Microsoft does not provide support for this Preview. [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] Technical Support will not be able to help you with issues or questions.

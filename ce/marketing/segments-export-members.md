# Export dynamic segment members to Excel

Export members from a dynamic segment straight to an Excel file, no matter how large the segment is. To export dynamic segment members to Excel:

1. Go to **Marketing** > **Customers** > **Segments**.
1. [Open or create a dynamic segment](segmentation-lists-subscriptions.md).
1. If the segment isn't live, select **Go live** on the command bar. Only live segments are fully resolved to include all relevant contacts.
1. Select **Export members** from the top ribbon on the page.
1. Your Excel file is generated and automatically downloaded.

> [!Note]
> Excel files exported from dynamic segments do not automatically update. If the members of your dynamic segment change and you want an updated Excel file, you must export a new file.

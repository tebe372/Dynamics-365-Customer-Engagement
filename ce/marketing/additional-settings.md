# Manage sample data in [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]

Sample data gives you something to experiment with as you learn, and helps you see how data is organized in the system. If sample data isn't installed on your system, you might want to add it for training purposes. Later, when you're ready, you can remove it.

To manage your sample data, go to **Settings** > **Others** > **Sample Data Management**. From here, you can see if you have sample data installed and choose whether to add or remove it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use sample data to learn and play around with system features. However, to avoid unwanted results, don't associate it with any data you actually need.

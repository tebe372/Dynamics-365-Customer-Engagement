# Real-time marketing event triggers

Event triggers control the flow of [event-based journeys](real-time-marketing-event-based-journey.md). They represent customer actions such as a whitepaper download, a form submitted, or a Wi-Fi sign-up. Event triggers can also represent significant business events, such as a purchase that has shipped or completion of an enrollment process.

Event triggers can be used to start, continue, or stop a journey. For example:

- A **Contact created** event can be used to start a journey to welcome a new user.
- An **Email opened** event can be used to trigger a follow-up response in a journey that engaged users by sending the users a promotional email.
- An **Order placed** event can be used as exit criteria to terminate a journey designed to periodically remind a customer to complete a purchase order.

## Event types

Real-time marketing offers three types of events in the event triggers catalog: custom events, interaction events, and business events.

### Custom events

Custom events are defined by real-time marketing users. Custom events provide a flexible way to capture any customer action or significant business event.

Refer to [Custom events triggers in real-time marketing](real-time-marketing-custom-events.md) for more information, including important notes about security for custom events.

### Interaction Events

Interaction events represent customer interactions with journey elements such as e-mail, SMS, and push channels. Interaction events cannot start or terminate journeys; they are used within a journey and represent a logical continuation of a preceding step. For example, when a journey sends an email message, a set of events such as *Email delivered*, *Email bounced*, or *Email opened* becomes available to journey authors, allowing them to make decisions about possible next steps.

### Business Events

Business events represent changes in Dynamics 365 applications such as Sales or Service. These changes can reflect either the creation of a new record, or an update to an existing one. The following business events are available:

- *Contact created*
- *Contact e-mail address updated*
- *Contact address updated*
- *Contact phone number updated*
- *Lead created*
- *Incident created*
- *Opportunity created*

# Known issues in real-time marketing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.
> 
> Microsoft doesn't provide support for this preview feature. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won’t be able to help you with issues or questions. Preview features aren’t meant for production use, especially to process personal data or other data that are subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements.

As we continue to work on the real-time marketing preview and refine the experience, we've become aware of some outstanding issues for you to bear in mind. These issues are summarized in the table below.

## Analytics

- In the aggregate cross-journey analytics dashboard, an extra step is needed to load the Power BI report in the Android and iPad native apps. To load the report, go to **Analytics**, then select a row, select the **Show as from** sub menu, then select **CC_Analytics_ReportingControl**.
- Data retention is 3 months for operational analytics and 12 months for the aggregate cross-journey analytics dashboard.
- In some cases of error, funnel numbers are adjusted for sanitization (for example, the delivered shouldn't exceed sent).

## Dynamics 365 Customer Insights

- Existing CI customers will need to set up a new CI environment using **Copy config**.

## Journey & orchestration

- Segment-based journeys will only work with segments that are less than 100,000 members. If you try to use a segment with more than 100,000 members, only the first 100,000 will enter the journey.

## SMS

- Currently limited to one phone number.
- Only United State numbers are issued (even when using the app in the United Kingdom).
- Dynamics 365 Customer Voice survey links are not supported in SMS messages.

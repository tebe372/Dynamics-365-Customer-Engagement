# Use outbound subscription centers in real-time journeys

This article explains how to use outbound marketing subscription centers in real-time journeys. Outbound subscription centers give you consent management flexibility, enabling you to have multiple subscription centers customized and branded to your needs.

> You can only use subscription centers in real-time journeys that target contacts. Journeys that target leads or customer profiles will continue to use the default preference page.

## Prerequisites

To use outbound subscription centers in real-time marketing, you must first create at least one subscription center in outbound marketing. You also need to make sure the configurable compliance settings feature switch is enabled.

### Create subscription centers in outbound marketing

If you havenâ€™t already, [create your subscription centers](set-up-subscription-center.md) in outbound marketing.

### Enable configurable compliance settings

Before you can use subscription centers in real-time journeys, you must enable configurable compliance settings:

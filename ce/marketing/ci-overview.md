# Dynamics 365 Customer Insights overview

Customer Insights combines the power of unified customer profiles with the ability to orchestrate customer journeys in real-time, at every touch point, into one software offering. Customer Insights consists of two apps: Customer Insights - Data (formerly Dynamics 365 Customer Insights) and Customer Insights - Journeys (formerly Dynamics 365 Marketing).

The combined app offering simplifies licensing to make it easier to buy and use the applications as your business engages more customers over time.

# Real-time marketing domain authentication

As discussed in the [Authenticate your domains](mkt-settings-authenticate-domains.md) article, domain authentication enables recipient email servers to confirm that the from-address shown on each of your email messages belongs to your organization. A method called *DomainKeys Identified Mail* (DKIM) helps make email authentication possible.

Dynamics 365 Marketing includes a guided wizard to set up DKIM, allowing you to authenticate domains for use in real-time marketing features. This article describes how to use the wizard.

## Authenticate a domain for use in real-time marketing

To authenticate a new domain or a subdomain for email sending and/or form hosting, follow the steps below:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email marketing** > **Domains**. A list of existing authenticated domains opens.

1. Select **New** on the command bar to add a new domain.

1. A guided wizard opens, prompting you to enter the domain that you want to authenticate, together with the reason for authenticating the domain: external form hosting and/or email sending. The wizard will reconfigure itself based on the selections that you make.

1. Depending on the selections you made during the previous step, the wizard will provide an ownership key and three sets of records that should be configured on the DNS providerâ€™s portal.

1. An overview of the data will be provided in the last step, along with the ability to bulk copy all of the values.

1. Provide the data to your DNS provider and follow their instructions. Once the DNS registration is complete, you can select **Verify** to complete the setup.

> [!NOTE]
> DNS registration may require up to 24 hours to take effect. You can leave the wizard at any time and come back to it to try again if the registration is not confirmed right away.

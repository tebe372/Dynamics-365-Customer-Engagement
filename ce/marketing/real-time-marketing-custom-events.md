# Create custom triggers in real-time marketing

Custom events are a flexible way to capture important moments and interactions, allowing you to orchestrate uniquely engaging customer interactions.

A custom event is a user-defined signal that can contain and transport any type of information that a customer journey can act upon. Real-time marketing users are in full control of what custom events represent and what kind of information they convey.

Creating a custom event in real-time marketing is straightforward. However, custom events require collaboration between marketing users and a developer team who will be responsible for integration of small snippets of code in systems that will ultimately trigger the event.

Creating a custom event involves three steps: initial event creation, event integration, and finalization.

## 1. Initial event creation

This step is performed in the **triggers** section of real-time marketing. To create the custom event, select **+New event** from the top ribbon and follow the on-screen instructions to define:

- **Title and Description**

  Give the event a short, descriptive title. Include a description to help other users find the right trigger in the catalog.  

- **Attributes**

  Event attributes enrich the event and provide additional context for the journey to create branches or personalize content. For example, a *Wi-Fi sign-up* custom event might contain a *Location* attribute that represents the physical location where a customer has completed a sign-up. The value of the *Location* attribute could then be used in a journey to send a different message depending on whether the sign-up comes from the parking lot or the main lobby.

  Attributes have a **Name** and a **Data type**. Choosing the correct data type (Text, Number, True or false, or Date/time) is important to ensure that customer journeys can provide appropriate comparators in conditions. For example, if an attribute is of data type **Number**, the journey will provide a comparator such as *less than* or *equal to*. If an attribute is of type **Date/time**, the journey will provide comparators such as *before*, *on*, and *after*.

- **Special Attributes**
  
    **Customer data** is a special attribute present by default in every custom event. This attribute contains information about the customer that performs the trigger action. The data type can either be a Dynamics 365 contact or lead, or a [Customer Insights profile](/customer-insights/audience-insights/overview). In code, this attribute is referred to as *authID*.

    **contactpoint_email** is a special attribute that is present in custom events that are tied to a Customer Insights profile. This attribute will be used as a fall back in case the full Customer Insights profile isn't available. Developers should include the customer's email in this attribute to ensure the customer can be reached by email even if their full profile information isn't available.

    **contactpoint_phone** is a special attribute that is present in custom events that are tied to a Customer Insights profile. This attribute will be used as a fall back in case the full Customer Insights profile isn't available. Developers should include the customer's phone number in this attribute to ensure the customer can be reached by text messages even if their full profile information isn't available.

## 2. Event integration

Once the event is created, a code snippet is generated by the system. You can download the code snippet and share it with developers. Or, developers can access the snippet directly through the link provided by the app.

> [!NOTE]
> To directly access the code snippet, developers will need access to the Dynamics 365 Marketing app.

The code snippet contains extensive instructions detailing how to integrate the event code on external systems. You can integrate the event using JavaScript (for web pages), C# or Python (for standalone systems), or through the iOS and Android SDKs.

> [!TIP]
> Some integration of custom events can present security implications. The code snippet that is provided with the event contains an *ingestion key* that uniquely identifies the real-time marketing instance. An attacker with access to the ingestion key could possibly send spurious events that can trigger unintended customer journeys. It's a good practice to:
> - Protect the ingestion key wherever possible.
> - Limit the use of attributes in custom events, especially when those attributes can be used to personalize content and act as potential attack vectors such as cross-site scripting.

## 3. Finalize the event

Once the integration has been completed, the **triggers** page will show information to confirm that the custom event is working as expected. With the integration complete and verified, the event will be marked as **Ready to use**, which will make the event visible and available in journeys.

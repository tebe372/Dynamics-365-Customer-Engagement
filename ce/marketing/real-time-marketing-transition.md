# Real-time marketing transition FAQ

## What is the real-time module in Dynamics 365 Marketing?

When Dynamics 365 Marketing was introduced almost five years ago, the app targeted a better-together solution with Dynamics 365 Sales and B2B scenarios. Once in the market, marketing industry trends and customer expectations changed. Instead of the typical megaphone-style marketing, customers demanded individualized engagement in the moments that matter. To meet those needs, we took the opportunity to innovate and modernize our stack and built a new, scalable module from the ground up: that module is real-time marketing.

We developed real-time marketing with an even stronger focus on usability to address both B2B and B2C marketing scenario and guide your organization to:

- Increase marketers' productivity

## How do I start with real-time marketing?

If you are a new customer, you can directly start using real-time marketing, and will not be able to access outbound module. Start by exploring real-time marketing and create a journey or send a quick email.

If you are current customers, Dynamics 365 Marketing is set in “Mixed-mode” both outbound and real-time capabilities are available and can be used simultaneously. Our recommended approach is to start progressively with real-time and then ramp up after you have gained confidence. You can start to use real-time for running new journeys. This way you will have time to train users and troubleshoot any dependencies or issues that may arise. Having created and successfully run a few real-time journeys, continue by moving your journeys. This would be a great time to revisit if the outbound journeys should be redesigned. Many of your journeys could flow more naturally and be reused by using triggers.

Furthermore, our AI-powered features make transitioning easy and efficient. With query assist, you can create segments in real-time within seconds, and content ideas helps you build engaging email content just by providing a few key points.

# Real-time marketing transition FAQ

## What is the real-time module in Dynamics 365 Marketing?

When Dynamics 365 Marketing was introduced almost five years ago, the app targeted a better-together solution with Dynamics 365 Sales and B2B scenarios. Once in the market, marketing industry trends and customer expectations changed. Instead of the typical megaphone-style marketing, customers demanded individualized engagement in the moments that matter. To meet those needs, we took the opportunity to innovate and modernize our stack and built a new, scalable module from the ground up: that module is real-time marketing.

We developed real-time marketing with an even stronger focus on usability to address both B2B and B2C marketing scenario and guide your organization to:

- Increase marketers' productivity
- Optimize every interaction
- Unify sales and marketing
- Scale your business

Our innovative real-time marketing module not only encompasses enhanced outbound module features but also integrates the latest industry technology, empowering businesses to stay ahead of the curve.

Real-time marketing hasn't only improved upon outbound marketing features, but also offers a wealth of additional benefits to deliver engaging B2C and B2B experiences. Real-time marketing allows you to leverage your data to gain valuable insights and predictions, enabling you to deliver personalized experiences to your customers. With real-time, trigger-based journeys, you can respond to your customer needs and preferences in the moments that matter, leading to increased engagement and satisfaction. Real-time marketing also supports enhanced segment-based journeys, allowing you to orchestrate traditional marketing activities such as seasonal campaigns targeting loyal customers.

Real-time marketing provides out of the box channels such as text messages, push notifications, or custom channels enabling you to reach your customers where they are. Using AI, dynamic text, and leveraging your data sources, you can personalize messages to each customer, enhancing the customer experience and driving better results.

Real-time marketing breaks down silos between sales and marketing, with a unified customer timeline, lead scoring advanced capabilities, and leads handoff to sales allowing your businesses to deliver seamless experiences throughout the entire customer journey. This results in increased efficiency, effectiveness, and customer satisfaction.

## How do I start with real-time marketing?

If you're a new customer, you can directly start using real-time marketing, and won't be able to access outbound module. Start by exploring real-time marketing and create a journey or send a quick email.

If you're a current customer, Dynamics 365 Marketing is set in “mixed-mode” both outbound and real-time capabilities are available and can be used simultaneously. Our recommended approach is to start progressively with real-time and then ramp up after you have gained confidence. You can start to use real-time for running new journeys. This way you'll have time to train users and troubleshoot any dependencies or issues that may arise. Having created and successfully run a few real-time journeys, continue by moving your journeys. This would be a great time to revisit if the outbound journeys should be redesigned. Many of your journeys could flow more naturally and be reused by using triggers.

Furthermore, our AI-powered features make transitioning easy and efficient. With query assist, you can create segments in real-time within seconds, and content ideas helps you build engaging email content just by providing a few key points.

## Where can I get help setting up real-time marketing?

The real-time marketing module is already available within your Dynamics 365 Marketing application. To get started, you can consult our documentation: [Real-time marketing overview](real-time-marketing-overview.md)

## As a partner, what if my customers want to use both modules?

New customers only have access to real-time marketing module. Upon request, and after considering specific customer needs and requirements outbound marketing can be enabled exceptionally via support.

For current customers, Dynamics 365 Marketing is set in “Mixed-mode” both outbound and real-time capabilities are available and can be used simultaneously. We nevertheless recommended customers to progressively start transitioning to real-time marketing to unlock the new presented features and gain in productivity and competitiveness.

As all new enhancements and investments are in real-time marketing, for the long term success for the customer, you should actively promote and discourage new customers going live in outbound.

## What does this mean for the outbound module?

The capabilities offered in real-time marketing exceed those offered in outbound, furthermore all innovation and new features are and will be focused on the real-time marketing module. Outbound is progressively being replaced by real-time marketing. In the coming year, we invite all our customers to transition to real-time marketing module to benefit from greater productivity in delivering experiences to engage your customers in the moment that matters.

    - The user interface for event planning and forms remains the same in both outbound and real-time marketing, eliminating the need for additional training. If you know how to use the email designer, you can seamlessly apply your knowledge to forms as well.
- **Segment building**

    - The journey user interface has been redesigned in real-time marketing. Customer feedback indicates that the new UI is more user-friendly, efficient, and natural. Any retraining required for the redesigned journey UI is considered a worthwhile investment, as it improves usability and effectiveness.

# How to follow up with participants using Microsoft Teams and Dynamics 365 Marketing

Teams has [built-in functionality](teams-journey.md) that allows you to quickly export webinar participant information to Marketing. In Marketing, you can then store contact information, follow up with participants with targeted campaigns, send personalized emails, and advertise upcoming events.

Here's how to export your Team's participant information to Marketing:

1. In Teams, select the **Attendance** tab to view the attendance report.
1. In the top-right corner, select **Turn attendance into results**.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The **Turn attendance into results** button only appears in the attendance tab *after* the webinar has ended.
    >
    > You must also be logged into Teams with an account that has sufficient privileges in Dynamics 365 Marketing. Learn more about the required Marketing privileges: [Required permissions to follow up with participants](teams-webinar-follow-up.md#required-permissions-to-follow-up-with-participants).
1. Select **Get started**. If you are an existing Marketing customer, a window pops up that lists your Dynamics organizations. Select the organization you want to use from the dropdown.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are not a Marketing customer, a window opens that allows you [sign up for a free 6 month Dynamics 365 Marketing trial](teams-journey.md).
1. A browser tab then opens with a customer journey and segments that are personalized to your webinar data.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams and Dynamics 365 Marketing each have their own [service-specific licensing terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering). The service-specific terms that apply depend on which service processes your data. For example, when you transition from Microsoft Teams to Dynamics 365 Marketing, your Microsoft Teams data related to the webinar (such as the attendance report, engagement data, etc.) is transferred to Dynamics 365 Marketing whereupon it becomes Dynamics 365 Marketing data and the Dynamics 365 service-specific terms apply.

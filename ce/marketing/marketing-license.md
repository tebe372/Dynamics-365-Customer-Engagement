# Get started with Dynamics 365 Marketing licensing

Before you purchase, provision, and begin using a Dynamics 365 Marketing environment, you'll need to decide which licensing options suit your needs. Purchasing a Marketing license involves four components: the base license, additional environments, additional capacity, and Solutions Only licenses. This article explains the considerations you should make regarding each component when purchasing the Marketing app.

- For information on pricing, visit the [Dynamics 365 Marketing pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/marketing/pricing/).
- To learn more about Dynamics 365 licensing, check out the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&clcid=0x409).

## Step 1: Decide on a base license

If you do not have any qualifying Dynamics 365 apps, you will need to purchase a standard Dynamics 365 Marketing base license. A "qualifying" app counts as any of the following, so long as there are 10 users or more:

- Dynamics 365 Sales
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service
- Dynamics 365 Field Service
- Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management
- Dynamics 365 Finance
- Dynamics 365 Commerce

### Dynamics 365 Marketing attach

If you have a qualifying Dynamics 365 app as listed above, you will be able to purchase Dynamics 365 Marketing attach at a reduced price.

## Step 2: Do you need additional instances?

You can purchase additional Marketing instances depending on your business needs. The pricing depends on whether the environment will be for *production* or *non-production* use. Examples of non-production use include sandbox and test environments. Non-production apps retain the same functionality as production apps, so they are great for testing features before you move them to a production instance.

## Step 3: Add more capacity

You can purchase additional contact or interaction packs if the capacity included in the base license does not meet your needs. A marketing interaction is a personalized message sent to any entity, such as a contact, lead, account, or Customer Insights profile, using real-time marketing features.  The message can be sent through out-of-the-box channels available in Dynamics 365 Marketing (for example, email, web-form submissions, push notifications, event check-ins, LinkedIn), external channels (for example, SMS providers), or third-party systems integrated with Dynamics 365 Marketing.

As mentioned in the [purchase and set up article](purchase-setup.md), contacts that are stored, but not marketed to using Dynamics 365 Marketing don't count towards the marketing contacts quota. After an interaction is logged for a contact, it doesn't matter how many marketing interactions that contact performs, the contact is still counted just once.

## Step 4: Do you need a Solutions Only license?

A Solution Only license includes all of the entities and solutions for Dynamics 365 Marketing, but doesn't include any of the marketing services. This means that marketing capabilities aren't available in this option (including email creation, email delivery, segmentation, customer journeys, and more). This license is intended for use on development and test environments when making customizations, solving compatibility issues, importing or exporting solutions, and doing other types of development and non-functional marketing testing. A Solution Only license is included with all paid licenses and allows you to install the Solution Only app on as many environments as needed.

## Next steps

After you've purchased your Dynamics 365 Marketing license, you'll need to start setting it up. Learn more in the [purchase and set up Dynamics 365 Marketing](purchase-setup.md) article.

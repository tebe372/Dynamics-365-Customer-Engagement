# Uninstall Marketing

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can remove [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] from any [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] instance where you have installed it. After removing it, you'll end up with a free [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] entitlement (license) that you can install on another [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] instance if needed.

The uninstall process has two steps:

1. Uninstall the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] services by running the uninstall wizard.
1. Clean up the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] solutions in [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-365](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before uninstalling Dynamics 365 for Marketing from an instance, you should be sure that you won't want to reinstall it on that instance again because problems can occur on reinstall. Before you can reinstall Marketing onto an instance where it was previously uninstalled, you must do one of the following:
> 
> - [Reset the instance](../admin/manage-sandbox-instances.md#BKMK_Reset) before starting to reinstall Marketing (sandbox instances only).
> - If a reset isn't possible, then please [contact Microsoft Support](setup-troubleshooting.md#contact-support) before attempting to reinstall Marketing.


## Uninstall the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] services
The [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] uninstall wizard manages most of the uninstall process. It:

- Removes all [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)], event management, and [!INCLUDE[cc-linkedin-solution](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)] services from your [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-365](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] application server.
- Removes your marketing insights service and its data.
- Turns off user syncing from [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-office-365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] for [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)]-only users.
- Frees your [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] entitlement (license) for use with another [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-365](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] instance if needed.

To run the uninstall wizard:

1. If you have sample data installed, remove it. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage sample data](additional-settings.md).

1. [Open the Dynamics 365 admin center](dynamics-365-admin-center.md).

1. To see a list of applications you have installed, select the **Applications** tab.  
    ![Open the Applications tab](media/update-app-tab.png "Open the Applications tab")

    The list shows a row named **Dynamics 365 Marketing Application** for each entitlement (license) you have for [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]. Free entitlements (which can't be uninstalled) show a **Status** of **Not configured**. Installed entitlements show a **Status** of **Configured** and include the name of the instance where they are installed as part of their application name.

1. Select the configured [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] entitlement that you want to uninstall, and then select the **Manage** button ![The Manage button](media/update-manage-button.png "The Manage button") in the side panel. 

1. The [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] setup wizard opens.  It shows the name of the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] instance you are about to uninstall. Confirm that you selected the right one.  
    ![Choose the Uninstall Marketing link](media/uninstall-wizard.png "Choose the Uninstall Marketing link")

1. Under **Other actions**, select **Uninstall Marketing from this org**.

1. Follow the instructions on your screen to confirm and complete the uninstall.

## Remove [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] solutions in [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-365](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)]
The uninstall wizard removes the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] services from your [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-365](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] server, but it leaves several solutions on your instance. You should clean these up to help keep your instance lean and running smoothly.

### Step 1: Stop all live entities and remove data dependencies

Before you remove any solutions, start by stopping all live entities, including:

- Customer journeys
- Marketing email messages
- Marketing pages
- Content settings
- Lead-scoring models
- Segments

Customer journeys can introduce data dependencies if they include launch-workflow and/or updated-record tiles. These dependencies may prevent you from uninstalling one or more solutions. To remove these:

- Delete all customer journeys that you can (you may be prevent from deleting journeys in any state other than **Draft**)
- If you have any customer journeys that you can't delete, do one of the following:
  - Wait for the journeys to transition into the **Expired** state (this will happen automatically 30 days after your stop them) and then delete them.
  - If you don't have any updated-record tiles left in any of your journeys, then you can proceed without deleting the rest of your journeys provided you do delete all workflows that are referenced by launch-workflow tiles in your remaining journeys.
- If you've customized your instance by adding any of the custom controls provided by [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] (such as the marketing calendar) to other entities, then remove these cusomizations.

### Step 2: Remove the solutions

> [!NOTE]
> The following procedure lists the uninstall order for solutions that are included in the latest version of [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)]. If you are uninstalling an earlier version, then just skip over any solution listed here that you don't see on your installation.

To remove the solutions:

1. Open the **Settings** menu ![The Settings menu icon](media/settings-icon.png "The Settings menu icon") at the top of the page and select **Advanced settings**. The [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] advanced-settings area then opens in a new browser tab. Note that this area uses a horizontal navigator at the top of the page instead of a side navigator.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Customization** > **Solutions** to manage your installed solutions.

1. Find each of the following solutions and remove them, one at a time, in the order listed here. (Some of the items listed may not be present on your instance, so just skip these.) To remove a solution, select its check box, and then select **Delete** on the command bar. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Install, update, or remove a preferred solution](../admin/install-remove-preferred-solution.md)

1. If you see any other "anchor" solutions that start with "MicrosoftDynamics_", then you can delete these too. They are probably left over from an earlier version that you upgraded.

1. If you're no longer using the [!include[](../includes/cc-linkedin-solution.md)], then also remove the LinkedInLeadGenIntegration solution.

1. If you're no longer using portal or [!INCLUDE[pn-voice-of-the-customer](../includes/pn-voice-of-the-customer.md)] functionality, you can also delete their related solutions.

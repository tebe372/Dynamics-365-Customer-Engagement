# Security roles for Lead scoring and qualification

This article is an overview of security roles related to Lead scoring and qualification.

## Understand Lead scoring and qualification security roles

To ensure that only appropriate users can create scoring models, Dynamics 365 Marketing provides two security roles: **Lead Score Modeler** and **Lead Score Viewer**.
1. **Lead score viewer**: Provides access to visualize scoring models yet can't write or modify them.
1. **Lead score modelers**: Provides comprehensive access, including the ability to create, modify or delete a scoring model.

By default, not everyone in your organization will have access to create or visualize scoring model.  If you want to use scoring models, make sure to set up the right permissions using the documentation below.

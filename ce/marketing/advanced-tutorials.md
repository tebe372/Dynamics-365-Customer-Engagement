# Advanced tutorials for specialist scenarios

The tutorials in this chapter are more specialized then those in the [Basic tutorials](basic-tutorials.md) chapter. The features described here are all important parts of [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)], but they are targeted for more specialized needs and therefore serve a somewhat smaller audience.  

When you have completed the exercise here, you will be able to:

- Create a customer journey that generates activities (such as phone calls, tasks, or appointments), assigns them to relevant staff, and associates each with a contact on that journey.

- Manage images for use in marketing emails and pages.

- Create templates for emails, pages, forms, and journeys so that other users can work more quickly while conforming to your organization’s graphical identity and specific business practices.

- Track website visits, social media clicks, and banner clicks so you can use them to score leads and evaluate the effectivity of your website and other marketing channels.

- Create an inbound customer journey, which attracts previously unknown contacts and tempts them to register with your organization.

- Set up a subscription center, with custom subscription lists, and include it in your emails and customer journeys.

The exercises given in this chapter assume you are already familiar with the feature described in the [Core scenarios](basic-tutorials.md) chapter, but they don’t otherwise build on each other so you can pick and choose which of these exercises are interesting to you.

# Use marketing forms for event registration

The event management application now allows you to use marketing forms for event registrations. You can create forms with a variety of fields, embed forms on your website, and use the forms for event registration.

## Create a marketing form for event registration

1. Go to **Marketing** > **Internet marketing** > **Marketing forms** to go to the list of all forms currently available on your instance.
2. Select **New** in the command bar.
3. Choose the **Event Registration Form** template.
4. The template will load into the form designer.

## Settings in the header

The header settings are available at the top of the page. To edit the header settings, select the **More header fields** button (which looks like a down-pointing chevron) at the side of the header. The button opens a drop-down dialog with the following settings:

- **Name:** Enter a name for the form. The form name you enter is the name you'll see in the forms list and when adding the form to an event page.
- **Form type:** For event registration marketing forms, leave the selected form type set to Event registration.

## Design customization, validating, and going live

You can [customize your registration form's design and check for errors](marketing-forms.md#design-and-validate-your-form-content) just as you would with any marketing form. You can even add custom fields or multi-select buttons. If no errors are returned after you validate your form, you are ready to [go live to make your form available for use](marketing-forms.md#go-live-to-make-your-marketing-form-available-for-use).

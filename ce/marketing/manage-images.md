# Manage images for landing pages and email messages

In [Create a marketing email and go live](create-marketing-email.md), you saw how to upload an image while adding it to an email message. You can use similar techniques to add images to your marketing page designs too. But you can also establish a library of images (and other files), which users can include in their designs. Your library will typically include brand identity graphics such as logos, product images, clipart, and more.  

Here are some best practices for working with images for your marketing materials:

-   Sketch out your email messages and marketing pages in an image-editing program before you start trying to design them in [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)]. This will make it easier to experiment, enable you to get your image sizes right, and should speed your work in [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)].

-   Always crop and size your images before you upload them.

-   When sizing your images, use the dimensions that will apply when viewed on the largest expected customer display.

-   Choose your keywords carefully and remember to apply them to images. As your library grows, this will become increasingly important.

## Manage keywords

To help you organize your images, and to help other users find them, [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] also supports a system of keywords that you can use to tag each image. You manage the keywords centrally to ensure that the number of keywords remains manageable, and the spelling consistent. When uploading an image, users can choose a keyword, but they canâ€™t create new one on the fly.

To manage keywords:

1.  Go to **[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] &gt; Internet [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] &gt; Keywords**. You now see a list of all existing keywords.

2.  Choose **New** from the command bar to create a new keyword. Its only setting is a **Name**.

> ![Enter the keyword name](media/keyword-name.png "Enter the keyword name")  

1.  Choose **Save** to save your keyword.

## View, edit and add images to your library

To view and edit your image library:

1.  Go to **[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] &gt; Internet [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] &gt; Files**. You now see a list of all existing images and files. Choose any row in the table here to view information about the file and edit its settings (including keywords).

2.  Choose **New** from the command bar to upload a new file. The **Upload Files** dialog opens.

3.  Either drag a file from a [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Explorer window to this dialog, or choose **browse** to locate and choose an image using a file browser window.

> ![The Upload Files dialog](media/files-upload.png "The Upload Files dialog")  

1.  While working here:

    -   Drag several images to add more than one image at a time.

    -   Apply keywords to each image using the **Add Keywrods** drop-down list.

    -   Remove a keyword from an image by choosing its close button (X).

    -   Remove an image by choosing its close button all the way on the right (also an X).

2.  Choose **Save** to upload your images to [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-2016-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)].

3.  If needed, go back to **[!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] &gt; Internet [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] &gt; Files**, where you can open any listed image and edit its display name.

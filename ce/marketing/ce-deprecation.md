# Deprecation: Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement

In October 2019, [Microsoft deprecated the *Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement* SKU/license plan](/dynamics365/admin/admin-guide). Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement included the following Dynamics 365 apps and their related services:

- Dynamics 365 Marketing
- Dynamics 365 Sales
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service
- Dynamics 365 Field Service
- Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation

As of 2022, Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement licenses purchased prior to the deprecation are now expiring. Licenses for the current customer engagement apps may be purchased individually. Learn more: [Dynamics 365 pricing](/dynamics365/licensing/update).

You can learn about migrating your data to a new Marketing instance in the [Tenant to tenant migration for Dynamics 365 Marketing](tenant-to-tenant.md) article.

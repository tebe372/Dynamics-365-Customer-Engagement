# Accessibility and keyboard shortcuts for Marketing

## General accessibility for Dynamics 365 applications

Dynamics 365 Marketing supports most (but not all) of the same keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features provided for other model-driven apps in Dynamics 365. For details, see the following help topics:

- [Accessibility for people with disabilities](../basics/accessibility-people-with-disabilities.md)
- [Keyboard shortcuts in Dynamics 365 applications](../basics/keyboard-shortcuts.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're working on an iOS device and using an attached keyboard, then use option+tab to move between user-interface elements (such as links, buttons, and tabs). The standard keyboard navigation technique for this is to use tab alone, but because Dynamics 365 Marketing sometimes uses specialized HTML constructs to create its feature (especially for the content and pipeline designers), some buttons and links will be skipped if you use tab alone. But if you use option+tab, you'll be able to navigate to everything.

## Accessibility and keyboard shortcuts for content designers

Dynamics 365 Marketing provides advanced digital-content designers for creating, styling, and previewing the various types of digital content that you can produce and manage with the system. This section lists keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features that are available for working with the designers for marketing email messages, marketing pages, and marketing forms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For keyboard shortcuts that include a number, you usually need to use the standard number keys, not the number pad.

Most of the standard navigation and selection keyboard commands also work when you are designing a customer journey or lead scoring model. In addition, some special assistance is provided to let you work with the tiles and arrange them on the canvas.

![An example of a customer journey](media/customer-journey.png "An example of a customer journey")

<a name="canvas-tabs"></a>

### Navigate to and within the side panel

The journey and scoring-model designers include a side panel that provides up to three tabs: a **Toolbox** of tiles that you can add to your design, **Properties** for configuring a tile selected on the canvas, and **Grades** for setting grade thresholds (lead-scoring only). When one of these tabs is open, you can navigate to and among its settings using the tab and arrow keys on your keyboard.

To navigate the side panel:

1. Press tab until you've selected the side panel, where one tab is currently active.
1. Use the arrow keys to switch the active side-panel tab. The tab is activated as soon as you select it.
1. Press tab to move between the active (editable) settings available in the current side-panel tab, or eventually to navigate away from the side-panel tab.
1. If you're using a screen reader and would like to read values for read-only (inactive) settings, then use arrow keys to navigate between the display values.

### Place a new tile

1. Press tab until you've selected the **Add** button in the canvas toolbar.
1. Press space to open the **Add** menu.
1. Use the arrow keys to select a tile type from the **Add** menu.
1. Press space to choose the tile type currently selected in the **Add** menu.  
    ![Add a tile from the toolbar](media/cj-add-menu-ill.png "Choose the type of tile you want to add")
1. Use the arrow keys to select where you want to insert the new tile in the pipeline. Select a new-tile position to place the tile in a new position, or select an existing tile to place the tile as a child of that tile.  
    ![Choose where to add the new tile](media/cj-add-location-ill.png "Choose where to add the new tile")
1. Press space to place the tile in the selected position.

### Delete a tile

1. Press tab until you've selected the canvas.

1. Press **Ctrl+C** to copy or **Ctrl+X** to cut.
1. Press **Ctrl+V** to activate paste mode.
1. Use the arrow keys to select where you want to insert the copied tile in the pipeline.
1. Press space to place the tile in the selected position.

### Expand a tile with child tiles

1. Press tab until you've selected the canvas.
1. Use the arrow keys to select the tile you want to expand.

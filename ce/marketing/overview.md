## When to use outbound versus real-time marketing

Marketing automation tools on the market are typically classified into two categories: business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C).

Outbound marketing thrives in the B2B marketing automation. You can send emails and newsletters, create forms and landing pages to capture leads which you can score and grade, then hand off to sales. It also has a great feature for managing in-person events and webinars that includes seamless integration with Microsoft Teams. Out of the box, outbound marketing provides email and social channel capabilities, but you can also build you own custom channels. [Learn more about outbound marketing](user-guide.md).

Real-time marketing works great as a B2C platform that can perform at scale. It allows you to engage with customers at specific moments through email and mobile channels as they interact with different parts of your organization. Because each customer's interaction is unique, real-time marketing has powerful capabilities to design personalized experiences throughout the customerâ€™s life cycle.

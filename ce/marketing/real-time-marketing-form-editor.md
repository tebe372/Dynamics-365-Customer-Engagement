# How to create and manage forms in real-time marketing

A marketing form is an inbound communication channel that allows your customers to register for newsletters, ask for quotations, etc. The form is defined by a set of input fields arranged into a form layout.

Each marketing form is made from a collection of fields, buttons, graphical elements, and a few configuration settings. Each field included in your form is linked to an attribute of entity in Dynamics 365 Marketing.

# Comparison of real-time and outbound marketing forms

The main difference is that real-time marketing form can update only one entity (typically lead or contact). This makes the form configuration and maintenance easier and allows to build properly targeted journeys.

# Move custom triggers between environments

If you use multiple environments for testing customizations, triggers, or other assets before making them available in a production environment, you can move draft custom trigger “definitions” between environments. 

> [!NOTE]
> Because each environment’s triggers are published using an ingestion key unique to that environment, it is currently not possible to move a *published* trigger to a new environment.

To move draft custom trigger definitions between environments, use the following steps:

1. Ensure the triggers you want to move are in a *Draft* state. If the triggers have already been published, you can stop them and the customer journeys using them.
1. Use [solution export/import](transfer-solution.md) to copy the following components from the test environment to the production environment:
    - **The “trigger” record for each custom trigger you want to move (Component Type: Triggers)**: This record carries the definitions of the custom triggers.
    - **The "catalogassignment" record for each custom trigger you want to move (Component Type: Catalog Assignments)**: Because these records may not have a display name and can't be opened in the "Select solution components" view, you might need to add the catalog assignment to the selected components, select the **OK** button, then open the catalog assignment in the main view to confirm that it contains your event name in the **Catalog Assignment Object** field. You can confirm that the catalog assignment records are contained in the solution file by navigating to the **Assets** folder inside the zip file and confirming that it contains a file called *catalogassignments.xml*.
    - **Adding the actual trigger to the solution**: This will also pull in the Custom API as a required component of the trigger.
        > [!TIP]
        > - The three folders you should expect in the solution zip are: Assets, customapis, and msdynmkt_eventmetadataset.
        > - Ensure that the solution import is done with an *Unmanaged* solution containing the trigger rather than a *Managed Solution*. An *Unmanaged* solution can be generated by going to the org where the solution is sourced from and selecting “unmanaged” instead of “managed” during the export process.
1. In the target environment, once you’ve verified that the custom trigger definitions have been copied, republish all the triggers so that they can be used in the journeys.
1. Any web/mobile/other applications that need to trigger journeys in your target environment now need to call the trigger using the new ingestion key. A developer will need to update the ingestion key. You can find the ingestion key by opening any custom trigger and opening the one-time setup code snippet for that trigger. To learn more about integrating the code snippet, see [Trigger integration](real-time-marketing-custom-triggers.md#2-trigger-integration).

    - If you’re using a Power Automate flow to raise the real-time marketing custom trigger, this step isn't required. However, make sure to create a new flow definition in the new environment and use it to raise the custom trigger.
        > [!TIP]
        > You should move triggers in their own solution independent of any other components you wish to move between orgs.

Real-time marketing uses [segments](segmentation-lists-subscriptions.md) directly from outbound marketing and [Customer Insights](/dynamics365/customer-insights/index). You can view the segments available to you in real-time marketing by going to **Audience** > **Segments**.

## Segments from outbound marketing

To create a journey based on a segment from outbound marketing:

1. Go to **Audience** > **Segments**.
1. Select any segment, then select **+New journey** in the top ribbon.

A new screen will open allowing you to use your selected segment to start your **Segment-based** journey.

You can also start a new journey from the segment details page.

To create a journey from the details page:

1. Go to **Audience** > **Segments**.
1. Select the name of any segment.
1. From the details page, select **+New journey** in the top ribbon.

## Create a new segment within your customer journey

You can create a new segment directly within the customer journey editor by selecting any **Attribute** tile, then going to **Segment** > **Look for segment** > **+New segment** in the right-side pane.

This will take you directly to the segment builder, where you can create and save your segment.

## Edit your segment

To edit your segment, select any segment name from the segments list. This will take you to the details view. Select **Open Segment** on the top ribbon. This will open the selected segment in its source builder. In the builder, select **Edit** to edit your segment.

You can determine the source of a segment by looking at the **Source** column in the segments list.

## Segments created in Customer Insights

If you have a subscription to [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](/dynamics365/customer-insights/index) and have connected your instance to Dynamics 365 Marketing, segments from Customer Insights will also be available to you in real-time marketing.

Learn more: [Use Customer Insights profiles and segments in real-time marketing](real-time-marketing-ci-profile.md)

As shown in the following image, you can see whether a segment is a Marketing segment or a Customer Insights segment when you make a segment selection in your customer journey.

## Exclusion segment

To exclude a segment in your customer journey, go to the right-side pane in the journey editor and select **Entry criteria**. Then, go to **Exclude this segment** and select any segment you want to exclude.

> [!NOTE]
> The segments shown for exclusion are based on the entry audience entity type. For example, if the entry audience segment is based on the **Contact** entity, only contact-based segments will be shown.

## Conditioning your customer journey based on a segment

To add a segment to a condition, select an **Attribute** in your customer journey, and then add a condition in the pane on the right side of the page.

## Suppression segments

You can use a segment as an exit criterion for your customer journey.

To use a suppression segment, select **Exit criteria** in the right-side pane in the customer journey editor. Then, choose a segment under **Exit by segment**.

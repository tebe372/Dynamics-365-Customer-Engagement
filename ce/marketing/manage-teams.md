# Manage teams

[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

A team is a group of users who share and collaborate on business records. A user can be associated with multiple teams.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings** > **Organization** > **Team Management**.
1. Select the **Add Team** button in the heading of the page.
1. Enter the following details.
    - **Team Name**: Give the team a name
    - **Business Unit Name**: This read-only value is your organization name.
    - **Team Description**: Describe the team.
    - **Team Administrator**: Select the person who will perform administrative tasks for the team, such as adding or removing members.
1. Select the **Add** button.

## Add or remove members to the team

1. On the **Team Management** page and select the team you want to add members to.
1. The **Team members** section lists the current team members. Do one of the following here:
    - To add a member, select the **Add existing user** button at the top of the **Team members** section and then select one or more existing users to add.
    - To remove a member, select the target member to highlight it, then select the **Remove** button at the top of the **Team members** section.
1. Save your settings.

## Manage roles for a team

You can assign any number of security roles to each team. When a team is assigned a role, all team members inherit the privileges associated with that role so long as they remain on that team.

To apply security roles to teams, and to customize each role, you must work in the [!INCLUDE[pn-custom-app-module](../includes/pn-custom-app-module.md)] app. For details about how to open this app, see [Move between apps](navigation.md#move-between-apps). For more information about managing teams and working with security roles in the custom app, see [Manage security, users, and team](../admin/manage-security-users-and-teams.md) and [Create or edit a security role](../admin/create-edit-security-role.md).

For more information about the security roles included with the [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)], see [Manage users](manage-users.md).

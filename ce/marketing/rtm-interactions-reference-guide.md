# Reference guide for real-time marketing interactions

The table below is sorted by real-time marketing channels (email, text message, push) and includes the data tables and columns real-time marketing interactions can be found in. The table also includes a description of the type of interaction data stored. For example, the description column shows that the msdynmkt_emailaddress field lists customers' email address.

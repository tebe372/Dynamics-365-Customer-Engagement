# Create real-time marketing emails

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.
> 
> Microsoft doesn't provide support for this preview feature. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won’t be able to help you with issues or questions. Preview features aren’t meant for production use, especially to process personal data or other data that are subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements.

The real-time marketing email editor shares much of its look and feel with the [outbound marketing email editor](prepare-marketing-emails.md). The email editor was recently upgraded to make email authoring easier and quicker.

## Features unique to the real-time marketing email editor

The real-time marketing email editor offers the following features that differ from the outbound marketing email editor:

### A larger workspace with a modern look and feel

The editor layout has a modern look and feel, with more editing space, thanks to a new slim header and fewer tabs and menus. The toolbox and all property panes are redesigned, making tools simpler to find and use.

### More editing capabilities

The real-time marketing editor features added editing capabilities, including more flexible layouts, easier image resizing, text line height adjustment, and more. We have also improved the HTML editor for more advanced users.

### Reliable email previews and accurate rendering

With improved email rendering and a new preview experience, you can trust that the target audience will receive the email you meant to send, regardless of your recipient’s device or email client.

### New personalization experience

The email editor features a new personalization experience with an intuitive point-and-click interface that guides you through all your available data.

### AI-driven image suggestions

The new editor analyzes the text content of your email and, using AI, suggests the most relevant images from the new asset library.

# Preview: Set up an automated SMS keyword flow in customer journeys

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it’s officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.
> 
> Microsoft doesn't provide support for this preview feature. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won’t be able to help you with issues or questions. Preview features aren’t meant for production use, especially to process personal data or other data that are subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements.

To branch your journeys based on your customers’ replies:

1. Select the **Send a text message** tile and choose a text message template that includes keywords.
1. Select **create branches** to automatically branch your customer journey based on the keywords.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Create branches screenshot](media/create-branches.png "Create branches screenshot")

1. Specify the next actions for each keyword and branch.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Specify keyword actions screenshot](media/keyword-actions.png "Specify keyword actions screenshot")

1. Choose how strict the keyword identification method should be.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Keyword identification screenshot](media/keyword-identification-method.png "Keyword identification screenshot")

Finally, you can also create additional branches and select keywords from the SMS keywords page that were not included in the text message template, in case you’d like to include branching for keywords that were communicated to customers in past text messages.

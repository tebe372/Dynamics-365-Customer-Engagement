# Set up an automated SMS keyword flow in customer journeys

To branch your journeys based on your customers’ replies:

1. Select the **Send a text message** tile and choose a text message template that includes keywords.
2. Select **create branches** to automatically branch your customer journey based on the keywords.

3. Specify the next actions for each keyword and branch.

4. Choose how strict the keyword identification method should be.

Finally, you can also create additional branches and select keywords from the SMS keywords page that were not included in the text message template, in case you’d like to include branching for keywords that were communicated to customers in past text messages.

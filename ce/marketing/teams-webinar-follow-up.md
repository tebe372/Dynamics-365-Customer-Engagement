# Follow up with Microsoft Teams webinar participants

Microsoft Teams allows you to connect with audiences through engaging webinars, created and managed directly within the familiar Teams interface. However, it’s critical to follow up with webinar participants, closing the loop of engagement and ensuring that the right leads are created and nurtured.  

For customers of Dynamics 365 Marketing who create Teams webinars, following up with participants is a one click operation. When a webinar is finished, the “Follow up with participants” button will prepare ready to use contacts, segments, emails, events, registrations, check-ins, as well as a journey, tying the webinar data together in the Marketing organization of your choice.

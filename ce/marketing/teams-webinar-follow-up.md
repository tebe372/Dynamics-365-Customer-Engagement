# Follow up with Microsoft Teams webinar participants

You can use Microsoft Teams to connect with audiences through engaging webinars, created and managed directly within the familiar Teams interface. After a webinar, it’s critical to follow up with participants. Follow ups close the loop of engagement, ensuring that the right leads are created and nurtured.  

For Dynamics 365 Marketing users who create Teams webinars, following up with participants is a one-click operation. When a webinar is finished, the “Follow up with participants” button automates your follow-up messaging in Marketing. Selecting the button prepares ready-to-use contacts, segments, emails, events, registrations, check-ins, and a journey, tying the webinar data together in the Marketing organization of your choice.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams and Dynamics 365 Marketing each have their own [service-specific licensing terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering). The service-specific terms that apply depend on which service processes your data. For example, when you transition from Microsoft Teams to Dynamics 365 Marketing, your Microsoft Teams data related to the webinar (such as the attendance report, engagement data, etc.) is transferred to Dynamics 365 Marketing whereupon it becomes Dynamics 365 Marketing data and the Dynamics 365 service-specific terms apply.

## How to follow up

In just a few steps, you can follow up with webinar participants, even if you are not an existing Dynamics 365 Marketing user. To follow up with participants:

1. In Teams, select the **Attendance** tab to view the attendance report.
1. In the top-right corner, select **Follow up with participants**.
1. A window pops up that lists your Dynamics organizations. Select the organization you want to use from the dropdown, then select **Get started**.
1. If you do not have a Dynamics organization, you can [sign up for a Dynamics 365 Marketing trial](trial-signup.md).
1. A browser tab will open. After a few moments, you will see a customer journey with segments that are customized for your webinar.

The customer journey uses the power of Dynamics 365 Marketing to follow up with webinar participants on three paths:

- The first path sends an email to registrants who did not attend the webinar.
- The second path sends an email to registrants who attended the webinar.
- The third path sends an email to registrants who canceled their webinar registration.

Each path includes an email template to send notification emails. You can customize each email template to suite your branding and company needs. You can also add tiles to create more complex paths for your journey.

# Follow up with Microsoft Teams webinar participants

Microsoft Teams allows you to connect with audiences through engaging webinars, created and managed directly within the familiar Teams interface. However, it’s critical to follow up with webinar participants, closing the loop of engagement and ensuring that the right leads are created and nurtured.  

For Dynamics 365 Marketing users who create Teams webinars, following up with participants is a one-click operation. When a webinar is finished, the “Follow up with participants” button automates your follow-up messaging in Marketing. Selecting the button prepares ready-to-use contacts, segments, emails, events, registrations, check-ins, as well as a journey, tying the webinar data together in the Marketing organization of your choice.

> Microsoft Teams and Dynamics 365 Marketing each have their own [service-specific licensing terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering).

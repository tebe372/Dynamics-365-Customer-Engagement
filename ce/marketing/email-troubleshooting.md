# Troubleshoot email issues

This article contains issues related to email administration in Dynamics 365 Marketing, as well as workarounds and solutions.

## Internal contacts are not receiving your marketing emails

If you are using Marketing to send email messages to internal users and they are not receiving your emails, the emails are likely being quarantined by your spam filter solution. To ensure that your emails arrive in your internal recipients' inboxes and successfully pass your spam solution checks, complete the following steps:

- [Add Dynamics 365 Marketing to your SPF record](create-spf-record.md)
- Determine if you are using any email security software (for example, Mimecast, Proofpoint, or IronPort)

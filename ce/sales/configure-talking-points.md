# Configure talking points 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Talking points will be deprecated from August 2022. After the feature is deprecated, sellers will stop getting talking point suggestions on the contact's page. We recommend that you integrate LinkedIn Sales Navigator with Dynamics 365 Sales to help your sellers get suggestions based on their contact's LinkedIn activities. For more information on what you get with the integration, see [View and work with LinkedIn Sales Navigator controls on forms](../linkedin/view-sales-navigator-forms.md) and for instructions on how to integrate, see [Integrate LinkedIn Sales Navigator solutions for Dynamics 365 Sales](../linkedin/integrate-sales-navigator.md). 

The talking points feature helps users in your organization to quickly establish communications with customers.

>This feature is intended to help sellers or sales managers enhance their teamâ€™s performance. This feature is not intended for use in making, and should not be used to make, decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring, recording, and storing communications with users. This also includes adequately notifying users that their communications with sales persons may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their sales persons that their communications with users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.

## To configure relationship analytics and health

1. Enable [relationship intelligence](enable-ri.md) if you haven't already.

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page, and select **Sales Insights settings**. 
   
3. Under **Relationship insights**, select **Analytics and Health**.  
    When you enable the relationship analytics feature, exchange integration is also automatically enabled. However, the integration won't work until your Microsoft 365 admin provides consent for Dynamics 365 to collect the data.  

1. (Optional) Under **Data Sources**, turn off **Exchange Online** if you don't want to include emails and meetings from Exchange Online in KPI calculations and analytics. In this case,  relationship analytics will be generated from Dynamics 365 data.

1. To show the relationship health score in opportunities, views, and charts, turn on **Relationship Health**. For more information on relationship health, see [Use relationship analytics to gather KPIs](relationship-analytics.md).

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can turn off this option if you don't want to show the score. However, relevant health data is still collected.

1. Under **Activity influence**, adjust the sliders according to the relative importance of common activities in calculating the relationship health score.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/relationship-analytics-relationship-health-adjust-activity.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Relationship analytics and health settings page, with the Activity influence settings shown.":::

1. In **Communication Frequency**, select how often your organization expects sales teams to communicate with customers.

    The value you select influences the expectation of more recent frequent communications in the health score. Less frequent communication reduces the expectation. More frequent communication increases it.

1. Under **Health score grading**, set the range of health scores to grade opportunities. To change the default values, point to the minimum value in the range and select the up or down arrow or type a new value.

    When the health score is calculated, the opportunities in your organization's pipeline are graded as Good, Fair, or Poor, according to the ranges you defined. Grading can take up to 24 hours.

    If you change a grade's minimum value, the adjacent grade's maximum value changes automatically with it. For example, if you change the minimum value for Good to *50*, the maximum value for Fair changes to *49*.

1. Select **Save**.
    Relationship analytics is now enabled and configured for your organization. To view the analytics, see [Use relationship analytics to gather KPIs](../sales/relationship-analytics.md).

# Configure relationship analytics and health

Your organization's sales teams can use the relationship analytics in Dynamics 365 Sales to monitor the health and risks of their customer relationships. Graphical representations of KPIs and activity histories are available for any contact, opportunity, lead, or account. Detailed analytics about customer interactions, patterns, and trends are based on interaction data from Dynamics 365 and Office. With more accurate and complete relationship information, sales teams can more effectively identify customers who need their attention.

Relationship analytics appears on Sales Insights opportunity record forms. Relationship health appears on opportunity record forms, list views, and charts.

## Turn on and configure relationship analytics and health

1. Under **Relationship insights**, select **Analytics and health**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you don't see **Analytics and health**, make sure the advanced Sales Insights features are turned on. To learn more, see [Install and configure premium Sales Insights features](./intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#install-and-configure-premium-sales-insights-features).

1. Turn on **Relationship analytics and health**.
<!-- When I turn on **Relationship analytics and health** in my demo, **Exchange Online** is automatically selected. In fact, I can't select it or unselect it. Is the following step needed? -->
1. Under **Data Sources**, select **Exchange Online** ​to include emails from Exchange Online in KPI calculations and analytics.

    >[!NOTE]
    >Your Office 365 administrator must give consent to use Office 365 data before relationship analytics can include Exchange Online emails.

1. To show the relationship health score in opportunities, views, and charts, turn on **Relationship Health**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can turn this option off if you don't want to show the score. However, relevant health data is still collected.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/relationship-analytics-relationship-health-enable.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Relationship analytics and health settings page, with the Relationship Health option shown.":::

1. Under **Activity influence**, adjust the sliders according to the relative importance of common activities in calculating the relationship health score.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/relationship-analytics-relationship-health-adjust-activity.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Relationship analytics and health settings page, with the Activity influence settings shown.":::

1. In **Communication Frequency**, select how often your organization expects sales teams to communicate with customers.

    The value you select influences the expectation of more recent frequent communications in the health score. Less frequent communication reduces the expectation. More frequent communication increases it.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/relationship-analytics-communication-frequency.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Relationship analytics and health settings page, with the Communication Frequency option shown.":::

1. Under **Health score grading**, set the range of health scores to grade opportunities. To change the default values, point to the minimum value in the range and select the up or down arrow or type a new value.

    When the health score is calculated, the opportunities in your organization's pipeline are graded as Good, Fair, or Poor, according to the ranges you defined. Grading can take up to 24 hours.

    If you change a grade's minimum value, the adjacent grade's maximum value changes automatically with it. For example, if you change the minimum value for Good to *50*, the maximum value for Fair changes to *49*.

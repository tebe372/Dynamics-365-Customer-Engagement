Great news! A lead that you thought wasn't interested has contacted you, and it looks like the person will buy after all. Assuming that you disqualified the lead (instead of deleting it), you'll be able to reopen it without reentering all the information you already gathered.  
  
1.  On the list of leads, select the down arrow, and then select the **Closed Leads** view.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Shows closed leads in Dynamics 365 Sales.](../sales-enterprise/media/close-sales-lead.png "Shows closed leads in Dynamics 365 Sales")  
  
2.  Select the lead you want to reopen, and then select **Reactivate Lead**.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Shows reactivating a lead in Dynamics 365 Sales.](../sales-enterprise/media/sales-lead-reactivate.png "Shows reactivating a lead in Dynamics 365 Sales")

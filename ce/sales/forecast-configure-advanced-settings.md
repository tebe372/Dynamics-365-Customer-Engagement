## Automatically hide parent rows

When you open a forecast, each parent node has a dedicated contributor row under the tree where individual [simple columns](choose-layout-and-columns-forecast.md#simple-type)&mdash;such as quota and revenue contribution&mdash;are shown. For certain organizations, these dedicated contributor rows might have null-value simple columns that display no revenue contributions. In the **Advanced** settings step, you can hide these dedicated contributor rows under the parent node.  
For example, you've configured a forecast based on **User** hierarchy. When the manager **Kenny Smith** opens the forecast, he can see a row dedicated for himself with null values along with other users, though he doesnâ€™t have any associated opportunities that include simple columns.  
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Forecast grid view.](media/forecast-hide-row-view-manger-row.png "Forecast grid view")  
In such cases, you can hide the dedicated contributor rows under the parent node. The parent row that includes the rolled-up values will still be displayed.  
As an administrator or forecast manager, you enable this feature by turning on the **Auto-hide parent row** toggle in the **Advanced** forecast configuration step.  
> [!NOTE]
> By default, this option is enabled.  
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Automatically hide the parent row.](media/forecast-hide-row-enable-auto-hide-row.png "Automatically hide the parent row")  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Though you can select the option to hide the parent row, the row won't be hidden if the parent row has underlying records or values defined for simple columns in the forecast.

## Enable multiple-currency selection

For sales teams that are distributed across different geographies, viewing the forecast revenue values in the organization's base currency might cause confusion for users who are accustomed to operating in the currency of their region. By enabling multiple-currency selection, sales teams can convert forecast revenue data to any currency that's available in the system, in real time, based on current conversion rates. This helps users across regions more readily understand the current state of the forecast in their own currency.  
>[!NOTE]
>The real-time conversion of forecast data is always based on the latest exchange rate defined by your organization.  
For example, you have sales teams in the United States and Europe. The US dollar is set as the base currency for your organization, and the euro is also available in the system. When you configure a forecast with multiple-currency selection enabled, sales teams that open the forecast will find the revenue values displayed in dollars. The sales team in Europe will have the option to select euro as the currency and display revenue in that currency. Any manual adjustments made to the forecast grid will use the selected currency.  
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Select currency drop-down menu.](media/forecast-multi-currency-select.png "Select currency drop-down menu")  
As an administrator or forecast manager, turn on the **Multi-currency selection** toggle in the **Advanced** forecast configuration step to allow users to view the forecast data in any currency that has been defined for your organization.  
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Enable multiple-currency selection.](media/forecast-multi-currency-enable.png "Enable multiple-currency selection")

## Set the default experience for underlying records (Preview)

As an administrator or forecast manager, you can define the default experience for each forecast configuration based on your forecast users' preferences. For example, if your users prefer a Kanban view instead of grid view, you can set the Kanban view as the default. 

[!INCLUDE [preview-disclaimer](../includes/preview-disclaimer.md)]

You can define the following default settings:

- [Set Kanban as default view](#set-kanban-as-default-view)

- [Select a default group by attribute](#select-a-default-group-by-attribute)
- [Select a default underlying records view](#select-a-default-underlying-records-view)

> [!NOTE]
> The most recent selection of the user overrides the default selection for that user. For example, if the default view for the underlying records is Kanban and a user switches to the grid view, then the underlying records will open in the grid view when they access it next time. 


### Set Kanban as default view

The underlying records of a forecast can be displayed in a grid/table view or Kanban view. If you want to set Kanban as the default view for the selected forecast configuration, enable the **Set kanban as default** option in the  **Advanced** step of the forecast configuration.

The following screenshot illustrates how enabling the Kanban option displays the Kanban view by default for the underlying forecast records: 

:::image type="content" source="media/forecast-default-kanban.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Kanban default and kanban view":::

### Select a default group by attribute

As an administrator or forecast manager, you can select an attribute for grouping the underlying records by default. Users can change the grouping attribute in their view and that selection will override the default grouping attribute for them.

> [!NOTE]
> The group by option is only supported in the grid/table view. If you want to group the records, then disable the **Set kanban as default** option. If you select both Kanban and grouping, then the default view will be set to Kanban; Groups will appear only when the user switches to the table/grid view.

Select the attribute from the **Default underlying records group by attribute (Preview)** dropdown in the **Advanced** step of the forecast configuration.

The following screenshot illustrates how selecting the attribute, groups the underlying records by default:

:::image type="content" source="media/forecast-default-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of group by default attributed and grouped records":::

### Select a default underlying records view

If you want users to view the underlying records using a specific view (such as My Open Opportunities) to give the most relevant information about the forecast, select that view as the default view for the forecast configuration.  

> [!NOTE]
> View selection is only supported in the grid/table view. If you want to open the records in a specific view by default, then disable the **Set kanban as default** option. If you select both Kanban and the view, then the records will open in Kanban; The default records view will appear only when the user switches to the table/grid view. 

Select the default view from the **Default underlying records view** dropdown in the **Advanced** step of the forecast configuration.

The following screenshot illustrates how selecting a view displays the underlying records in that view by default:

:::image type="content" source="media/forecast-default-records-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of default underlying records view and view selection":::

## Enable prediction factors

Predictive forecasting factors provide additional details about the components of a forecast prediction. By analyzing these details, you can discover new insights about your data and understand how it's influencing the prediction. The following image is an example of a **Prediction details** pane, including the top factors that influence the prediction.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Prediction details pane.](media/predictive-forecasting-prediction-details.png "Prediction details pane")

As an administrator or forecast manager, you turn on the **View prediction insights** toggle in the **Advanced** forecast configuration step to allow users to view top factors and insights for predictions in the **Prediction details** pane.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Enable prediction factors.](media/forecast-prediction-factors-enable.png "Enable prediction factors")  

>[!NOTE]
>Premium forecasting must be enabled for the **Prediction details** pane to work. More information: [About premium forecasting](/dynamics365/ai/sales/configure-premium-forecasting)

## Customize underlying records

You can customize underlying records by adding a JavaScript library. These customizations include disabling fields based on a certain logic, preventing fields from being automatically saved, and setting error notifications for fields. Before you upload it, the JavaScript library must be created in accordance with the schemas defined in [Events and context object](../sales-enterprise/developer/reference/custom-actions/events-context.md).  
**To create and upload a JavaScript library**  
1. Write your custom JavaScript code. In the following example, we create JavaScript to disable all fields except a few for the **Opportunity** entity.   
    ```JavaScript
    function OnRowLoad(executionContext) {

    // Get the logical name of the loaded entity as part of forecasting editable grid.
    var entityName = executionContext.getFormContext().data.entity.getEntityName();

        if (entityName === "opportunity") {

            // Defining the attributes list from opportunity that must be enabled if loaded as part of view.
            var OPTY_ENABLE_ATTRS_LIST = ["name", "msdyn_forecastcategory", "actualvalue", "actualclosedate", "estimatedvalue", "estimatedclosedate"];

            executionContext.getFormContext().data.entity.attributes.forEach(
                attribute => {
                    // Disabling all attributes other than OPTY_ENABLE_ATTRS_LIST
                    if (!OPTY_ENABLE_ATTRS_LIST.includes(attribute.getName())) {
                        attribute.controls.get(0).setDisabled(true);
                    }
                }
            )        
        }
    }
    ```      
    > [!NOTE]
    > -	The function names in the JavaScript file must match the event names and must accept the context object parameter. 
    > -	The forecasting context object that's referred to in the example is different from the execution context of the Microsoft Dataverse. A forecasting context object is specific to forecasting and supports the advanced configurations of the underlying records grid. More information: [Events and context object](../sales-enterprise/developer/reference/custom-actions/events-context.md)  
2.	Add your JavaScript code in a Script web resource.  
    1. Go to your customer engagement app instance in a browser, and select **Settings** > **Customizations**.
    2. In the **Customization** area, select **Customize the System**.
    3. In the solution explorer, under **Components**, select **Web Resources**.
    4. Select **New**.
    5. In the new web resource dialog box, enter the **Name** (for example, **mySampleScript.js**) and **Display Name**(for example, **Sample: Walkthrough script**) for your web resource.
    6. From the **Type** drop-down list, select **Script (JScript)**, and then do one of the following:
        - Select **Choose File** to upload the file containing your JavaScript code.
        - Select **Text Editor**, and then paste your JavaScript code in the editor. 
    7. Select **Save**, and then select **Publish**.  
3.	Upload the JavaScript library to your forecast configuration.      
    >[!NOTE]
    >You can have only one JavaScript file at a time for a forecast. To upload a new file, you must first remove the existing file. You can upload a file to a forecast at any time.      
    1.	On the forecast configuration page, go to the **Advanced** step, and under **Customize underlying records**, select **Add a JavaScript library**.  
        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Select the add a JavaScript library option.](media/forecast-javascript-select-option-upload.png "Select the add a JavaScript library option")           
    2.	In the **Add a JavaScript library** dialog box, search for the JavaScript file that you want to upload, and then select **Add**.  
        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Select a JavaScript library.](media/forecast-javascript-choose-file.png "Select a JavaScript library")          
The file is added to the forecast.

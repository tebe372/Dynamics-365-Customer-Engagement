# View and understand call summary page in Conversation Intelligence app

Sellers and their managers need an easy way to review the conversations they've had with their customers and quickly find relevant talking points, keywords, and insights.  
The call summary page provides a high-level view of how the conversation with a customer went, and includes action items and relevant keywords, a timeline, a transcript of the call, and more.  

The information on the call summary page helps both sellers and managers:

- Sellers can quickly ramp up on past conversations with customers, and highlight important topics and commitments.
- Managers can get a high-level view of how their team is managing their relationships with customers.  

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | Any primary sales role, such as salesperson or sales manager<br>  More information: [Primary sales roles](security-roles-for-sales.md#primary-sales-roles)|


## Prerequisites

- Configure conversation intelligence to process call recordings. More information: [Administer conversation intelligence](intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#administer-conversation-intelligence)
- [Configure conversation intelligence to connect call data](configure-conversation-intelligence-call-data.md) so you can process call recordings.
- To display the **Call Insights** tab in Sales Hub, ensure that [the latest version of Sales Insights](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.70b76f06-f739-4808-bd58-b5674a0a42d4?tab=Overview) is installed in your organization.
- [Include and update the *CallPhoneCallCrmId* parameter](configure-conversation-intelligence-call-data.md#upload-call-recordings) with your Dynamics 365 organization's GUID to the metadata file while uploading the call recordings for processing. This helps to connect the call with the activity inside Dynamics 365.

## Understand the call summary page   

A call summary page includes the following sections:     
- [Overview, notes, action items, and highlights](#overview-notes-action-items-and-highlights)   
- [Call transcript and translation](#call-transcript-and-translation)  
- [Call playback timeline and segmentation](#call-playback-timeline-and-segmentation)    

### Overview, notes, action items, and highlights   

#### Overview tab

The **Overview** tab displays the names of the people who participated in a conversation, along with KPIs such as average talking speed, switch per conversations, average pause, and longest customer monologue. Also, you can see the tags that have been added to the conversation to improve searchability. The following image shows the **Overview** tab.

#### Notes tab   

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The **Notes** tab in the call summary page helps you reduce the time to summarize the call  and add the provided intelligent suggestions to the summary including action items, commitments, call minutes, and next steps.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you don’t see the **Notes** tab, contact your administrator to enable the features in the **New and upcoming features** section of the conversation intelligence configuration page.

### Call playback timeline and segmentation   

The following image shows an example of call playback timeline.    

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

Using the call playback feature, you can listen to the entire recorded call or choose a point on the timeline&mdash;by dragging the progress bar or selecting the specific point&mdash;at which you want to start listening. The call transcript will automatically scroll to that moment in the call. You can also pause, rewind, and move forward through the call, and adjust volume as you like. The playback timeline also displays the sentiments detected in the conversation (positive, neutral, or negative).  

When you go to the **Highlights** tab and select a keyword or other highlight, a diamond icon appears on the playback timeline to indicate the time that the selected highlight was mentioned. Also, hovering over a keyword displays gray diamond icons on the timeline. 

You can also quickly go to the comments added by your colleagues from the timeline. Select the comment icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/comment-icon.png" border="false":::) on the timeline to go to the corresponding comment in the transcript.  

On the timeline, you can see how the conversation was segmented. The topics (if any) that were discussed in a segment are identified. To better drill down into the conversation, you can choose a specific segment and see the insights that are relevant to it. Some examples of segments are introduction, solution, price quote, and call close. The transcript is adjusted to display the start of the segment, and the playback timeline is highlighted for the selected segment. If the selected segment contains any action items or keywords, they're displayed on their respective tabs.

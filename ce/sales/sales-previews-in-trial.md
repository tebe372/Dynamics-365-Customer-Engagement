## Sales accelerator

Accelerate sales by,
- prioritizing the customer list quickly by using an intelligent work list. The work list helps you reach out to the next best lead or opportunity by displaying relevant sales information and customer context. 
- defining sequences for different scenarios that your sales team is likely to encounter. This helps sales teams to be consistent as they know the steps they need to take to move the deal forward. 
- creating rules to automatically assign leads and opportunities to the sellers.

# What are preview features

This article describes what are preview features, disclaimers related to preview features, and how to identify them in your trial instance. If you're interested to know the featured capabilities in the Dynamics 365 Sales trial, see [Explore features in trial](features-in-trial.md).

Preview features are features that aren't complete, but are made available on a "preview" basis so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

Preview features come with some disclaimers. Preview features:

- Are subject to separate [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511446).

- Aren't meant for production use.

- Aren't supported by Microsoft Support for production use. Microsoft Support is, however, eager to get your feedback on the preview functionality, and might provide best-effort support in certain cases.

- May have limited or restricted functionality.

- May not be available in all geographic areas.

## How to identify a preview feature

You get access to some preview features as part of your Dynamics 365 Sales trial. These features will have a **Preview** label in the app and in the documentation. For example, refer to the [Preview: Manage opportunities using pipeline view](use-opportunity-pipeline-view.md) article.

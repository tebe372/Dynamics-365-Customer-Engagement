# What are preview features

Preview features are features that aren't complete, but are made available on a "preview" basis so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features:

- Are subject to separate [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/legaldocs/supp-dynamics365-preview/).

- Are not supported by Microsoft Support for production use. Microsoft Support is, however, eager to get your feedback on the preview functionality, and might provide best effort support in certain cases.

- May have limited or restricted functionality.

- Aren't meant for production use.

- May be available only in selected geographic areas.


## How to identify a preview feature

As part of your Dynamics 365 Sales trial, you get access to some of the preview features. These features will have a **Preview** label in the user interface and in the documentation. For example, the Teams collaboration feature is in preview, and you would see that the documentation and UI will have preview labels and disclaimers about the preview feature. As an example, see the [Use Microsoft Teams chat in Sales Hub (preview)](teams-integration/using-teams-chat-in-dynamics.md) article.

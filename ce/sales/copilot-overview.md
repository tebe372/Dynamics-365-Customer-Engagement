# Sales Copilot overview

Sales Copilot is an AI assistant that helps sales teams be more productive and efficient in their daily work. It has a chat interface that sellers can use to get a quick summary of their opportunity and lead records, catch up on updates, prepare for meetings, and read the latest news about their accounts.

Sales Copilot is turned on by default in all sales apps for orgs in North America. If your org is in a different region, you need to [turn on Sales Copilot manually](enable-setup-copilot.md).

Sales Copilot is also available as an add-in in Outlook and an integrated app in Teams, allowing you to capture, access, and update your customer account data in the apps you use every day. The add-in and Teams app have generative AI capabilities such as record summarization and email content generation. Learn more about [Microsoft Sales Copilot](/microsoft-sales-copilot/introduction) and its [generative AI capabilities](/microsoft-sales-copilot/ai-sales-copilot).

## Sales Copilot capabilities

Sales Copilot offers the following capabilities:

- [Record summarization](#record-summarization)
- [Record catch up](#record-catch-up)
- [Meeting preparation](#meeting-preparation)
- [Email assistance](#email-assistance)
- [News updates](#news-updates)

### Record summarization

Record summarization helps you [get a quick summary of your opportunity and lead records](use-sales-copilot.md#summarize-an-opportunity-or-a-lead). By default, Copilot generates the summary from your default opportunity and lead views. A system administrator can set up Copilot to [generate the summary from other columns](configure-sales-copilot.md#configure-record-summary-and-catch-up-fields). Your entire sales team should agree on the seven columns that are most relevant for your business and should be included in the summary.

### Record catch up

To [help you stay on top of your opportunities and leads](use-sales-copilot.md#catch-up-with-an-opportunity-or-lead), Copilot summarizes any changes made to your records since your last visit or in the last seven days. Copilot generates the catch-up summary from the records' audit history. A system administrator sets up [the columns that are included in the catch up](configure-sales-copilot.md#configure-record-summary-and-catch-up-fields). Your entire sales team should agree on the 10 fields that are most relevant for your business and should be included in the catch up.

### Meeting preparation

Copilot helps you [prepare for your upcoming meetings](use-sales-copilot.md#prepare-for-upcoming-meetings) effortlessly, summarizing relevant information from the opportunity or lead records that are associated with the day's meetings.

### Email assistance

Copilot can help you [compose professional-looking emails](compose-send-email-copilot.md), [summarize email conversations to add to your customer notes](view-copy-email-summary.md), and get reminders to [follow up on emails you haven't replied to](use-sales-copilot.md#show-emails-that-are-not-replied).

### News updates

Copilot news updates help you stay current with the [latest news about your accounts](use-sales-copilot.md#show-latest-news-for-an-account). News updates can be great conversation starters and help you understand the dynamics of your customers' organizations. Ask Copilot to get you the latest news related to an account and it returns a list of articles that feature or mention the account, curated by Bing. As with any content that's provided by AI, make sure you read the news articles thoroughly and confirm that they're from an authentic source and are indeed about the customer.

## Region availability and languages supported

Sales Copilot is available in all regions in English only. If you turn on the feature outside of North America, you need to opt in to share some data with the Azure OpenAI Service outside of your default geography.

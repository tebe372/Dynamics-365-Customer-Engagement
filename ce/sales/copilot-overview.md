# Sales Copilot overview

Sales Copilot is an AI assistant that helps your sales team be more productive and efficient in their daily work. It has a chat interface that sellers can use to get a quick summary of their opportunity and lead records, catch up on updates, prepare for meetings, and so on. It also has an interface to compose emails, which helps sellers compose professional-looking emails in no time. 

Sales Copilot offers the following capabilities:

- **Record summarization**: Get a quick summary of the opportunity and lead records generated from the fields that matter to you the most. For example, let's say that estimated revenue, close date, contact, and BPF stage are the first few things that you look for in an opportunity. Work with your administrator to configure these fields for summarization. Now, when you ask copilot to summarize an opportunity, you'll get a summary of the opportunity record that includes the estimated revenue, close date, contact, and BPF stage. These fields are configurable at the organization level. Ensure that your entire sales team agrees on the top seven fields that are most relevant to your business.

- **Record catch up**: Catch up on the updates to your opportunity and lead records since the last seven days. Stay on top of your opportunities and leads by asking Copilot to summarize the changes to fields that matter to you the most. For example, let's say that you want to stay on top of changes to close date, estimated revenue, and contact. Work with your administrator to configure these fields for catch up. These fields are configurable at the organization level. Ensure that your entire sales team agrees on the top 10 fields that are most relevant to your business. 

- **Meeting preparation**: Prepare for your meetings with copilot summarizing the last three interactions from the Notes content that were recorded in the last three months.

- **Email assistance**: Use Copilot to compose professional-looking emails, respond to emails, and get email follow up reminders.

## Region availability and languages supported

Sales Copilot is available in all regions and is supported only in English. If you're enabling the feature outside the United States, you'll need to opt in to share relevant data with the Azure OpenAI Service in the United States. This opt-in may result in the transfer of relevant data outside of your default geography. To learn more, see [Copilot data movement across geographies](sales-copilot-data-movement.md).

## Accuracy of the Copilot responses

As Copilot is an AI assistant, it learns from the data in your organization. The accuracy of the responses depends on the quality of the data in your organization. When in doubt, verify the details in the record and provide feedback to Copilot. Copilot uses your feedback to improve the accuracy of its responses.

## Region availability and languages supported

Sales Copilot is available in all regions and supports English (United States) language only. If you're enabling the feature outside the United States, you'll need to opt in to share relevant data with the Azure OpenAI Service in the United States. This opt-in may result in the transfer of relevant data outside of your default geography. To learn more, see [Copilot data movement across geographies](sales-copilot-data-movement.md).

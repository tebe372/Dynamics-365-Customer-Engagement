# Enable sales order processing integration 

Connect Dynamics 365 Sales with an external order processing application by enabling this integration.

## How the integration works?

Sales order processing integration makes it convenient to connect Dynamics 365 Sales with an external back-office order processing application. It allows a sales order created on Dynamics 365 Sales to be submitted, after which the order can be synced to an external order processing application where the lifecycle of the order continues. A submitted order is locked for editing on Dynamics 365 Sales unless it was submitted by an integration user (to sync changes from the external order processing system to Dynamics 365 Sales). 

By default, sales order processing is turned off. When sales order processing is turned off, Dynamics 365 Sales allows invoices to be created from orders. More information: [Create an invoice from an order](../create-edit-invoice-sales.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Price computation can be triggered by Dynamics 365 Sales only if the sales entities like Opportunity, Quote, Sales order, and Invoice are editable.

## Enable sales order processing integration

You can enable sales order processing integration by setting the value of the [IsSOPIntegrationEnabled](../../customerengagement/on-premises/developer/entities/organization.md#BKMK_IsSOPIntegrationEnabled) attribute on the [Organization entity](../../customerengagement/on-premises/developer/entities/organization.md) to **Yes (1)**.

## What happens when sales order processing is turned on?

When sales order processing is turned on:  

- The **Create Invoice** button isn't shown on the command bar of the order records. 

- Order records will support a **Submit** order button. When the order is submitted, the status for the order is marked as `Submitted` and the order is made read-only, unless it was created by an integration user. More information: [IsIntegrationUser attribute](../../customerengagement/on-premises/developer/entities/systemuser.md#BKMK_IsIntegrationUser)

The following table lists the conditions that need to be satisfied before Dynamics 365 Sales executes price computation for various entities.

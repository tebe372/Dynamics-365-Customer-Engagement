# Move the opportunity through different stages

An opportunity goes through different stages (also known as pipeline phase) as you make progress and get more details about the opportunity. Each stage defines the information that you should've collected about the opportunity to methodically progress and increase your chances of winning the deal. 

:::image type="content" source="media/opportunity-all-stages.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the different opportunity stages.":::

> [!NOTE]
>- It's important to keep the stage current as it's used in sales charts and dashboards. For example, the funnel chart displays the opportunities in different stages.  
>- If your organization has multiple business process flows for the opportunity entity, the **Pipeline Phase** field stores the last stage change information done on the opportunity record through any business process flow. If you're using multiple business process flows on opportunity, exercise your discretion while using this field.

# Engage with customers through text messages

Sending and receiving text messages through SMS is an effective way for sellers to reach out to potential customers as it is fast, convenient, and allows for quick responses. Sellers use SMS to stay in touch with their customers, by responding to questions or concerns, and providing updates and information on products/services.  
Dynamics 365 Sales enables your sellers to send and receive SMS from customers through the text message feature. Also, sellers can refer to their past communication in context without leaving the application or losing their view of their customers' details.   

In the sequences, SMS can be included as a step to send reminders or updates about key events. 

>[!NOTE]
>The text message feature is being rolled out in a phased manner across different geographic regions. To verify whether the feature is available in your region, look for version 9.0.23023.10002 in the [Latest version availability](/dynamics365/released-versions/dynamics365salesinsights) section.

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can purchase or reuse an existing SMS account to send text messages. **The integration works for all countries** in which a phone number can be purchased through Infobip, LINK Mobility, TeleSign, or Twilio.

## Sign up for and configure an Infobip account

Infobip integration uses their public APIs to send and receive text messages. You need to sign up for an Infobip account to enable the real-time SMS integration. To create an Infobip account:

1. Go to [Infobip](https://www.infobip.com/signup) and sign up for a free account that can be upgraded to pay-as-you-go or a monthly subscription later.

1. In your Infobip [Account homepage](https://portal.infobip.com/homepage/), navigate to the **Developers** tab and note the **API key** and **API Base URL** values. These values are required to create the integration between Dynamics 365 Sales and Infobip.

1. [Purchase SMS phone numbers](https://portal.infobip.com/apps/sms) through your Infobip account.

## Sign up for and configure a LINK Mobility account

Like Infobip, LINK Mobility integration uses their public APIs to send and receive text messages. You need to sign up for a LINK Mobility account to enable the real-time SMS integration. To create an LINK Mobility account:

1. Go to [LINK Mobility](https://www.linkmobility.com/) and sign up for a trial account that can be upgraded later.

1. [Contact the link mobility team](https://www.linkmobility.com/contact-us) to purchase numbers and get all the account integration details required to create the integration between Dynamics 365 Sales and LINK Mobility.

## Sign up for and configure a TeleSign account

TeleSign integration uses TeleSign's public APIs to send and receive text messages. You need to sign up for a TeleSign account to enable TeleSign as SMS provider in Dynamics 365 Sales. To create a TeleSign account:

1.	Go to [TeleSign](https://portal.telesign.com/signup) and sign up for a trial account. If you expect to send high volumes of SMS traffic (more than 100,000 messages per month), contact TeleSign to request an invoiced enterprise account.

2.	In your TeleSign account [Dashboard](https://portal.telesign.com/portal/dashboard), note the CUSTOMER ID and API KEY values. These values are required while configuring TeleSign as the SMS provider in Dynamics 365 Sales.

3.	Purchase SMS phone numbers through your TeleSign account.

4.	On the [TeleSign SMS Settings](https://portal.telesign.com/portal/sms-settings) page, switch the **Status Callback** toggle to Enabled. This applies to **Standard** accounts. If you have an **Enterprise** account, you’ll need to contact TeleSign to enable the status callback setting for you. 

5.	You're provided with a callback URL that must be sent to [TeleSign support](mailto:support@telesign.com). This callback URL is specific to your organization and is available when you add SMS support for your organization.

## Sign up for and configure a Twilio account

Twilio integration uses Twilio's public APIs to send and receive text messages. You need to sign up for a Twilio account to enable Twilio as SMS provider in Dynamics 365 Sales. To create a Twilio account:

1.	Go to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and sign up for a trial account that can be upgraded to pay-as-you-go. If you expect to send high volumes of SMS traffic (more than 100,000 messages per month), contact Twilio to request an invoiced enterprise account.

2.	In your Twilio account [General Settings](https://console.twilio.com/us1/account/manage-account/general-settings), note the ACCOUNT SID and AUTH TOKEN values. These values are required while configuring Twilio as the SMS provider in Dynamics 365 Sales.

3.	[Purchase SMS phone numbers](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/search?frameUrl=%2Fconsole%2Fphone-numbers%2Fsearch%3Fx-target-region%3Dus1&currentFrameUrl=%2Fconsole%2Fphone-numbers%2Fsearch%3FisoCountry%3DUS%26types%255B%255D%3DLocal%26types%255B%255D%3DTollfree%26capabilities%255B%255D%3DSms%26capabilities%255B%255D%3DMms%26capabilities%255B%255D%3DVoice%26capabilities%255B%255D%3DFax%26searchTerm%3D%26searchFilter%3Dleft%26searchType%3Dnumber%26x-target-region%3Dus1%26__override_layout__%3Dembed%26bifrost%3Dtrue) through your Twilio account.

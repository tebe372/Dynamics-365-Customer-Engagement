NOTE re: "cards": I noticed that items in the work list aren't called "cards" anywhere else in this doc set. They're just "work items." The settings page itself is called "Work item appearance." I removed references to "cards" in this article.
NOTE re: screenshots: I tweaked the screenshots in this article to use red boxes, not orange. I noticed that other articles in this doc also set use orange boxes. The Microsoft Style Guide directs us to use red callouts.
NOTE: I think this article could be part of the personalize-sales-accelerator.md article. It's dealing with the same settings, just at a personal level. Or if you do keep it separate (which is fine), please include a link to this article in that one.

# Customize the appearance of work items

The work list in sales accelerator helps sellers prioritize their time and effort. Customize work items to display the most relevant and important information in the work list. You can customize work items for each entity type your sellers work with.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |  
| --- | --- |
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Microsoft Relationship Sales, or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise<br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | Any [primary sales role](security-roles-for-sales.md#primary-sales-roles), such as salesperson or sales manager |

If you're an administrator, you can customize work items for yourself and for your organization. You can also allow sellers to override your customizations.

If you have a primary sales role, you can customize work items for yourself. Your customizations don't affect what other sellers see in their work list.

1. In the left pane, under **My Work**, select **Sales accelerator**.

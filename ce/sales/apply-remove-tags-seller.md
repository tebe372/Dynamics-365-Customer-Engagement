## Apply tags to a sequence

With the Salesperson role, you can't create, edit, or delete tags. However, if your sales manager or administrator created tags, you can apply them to sequences.

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **Personal settings**.

1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequences**.   

1.	Select the sequence to which you want to apply tags, and then select **Edit tags**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can also select the **Edit tags** option by opening the sequence.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select Edit tags for a sequence.](media/sa-sequence-tags-apply-tag-select-edit-tag.png "Select Edit tags for a sequence")    
    
1.	On the **Edit sequence tags** pane, select **Add tags to sequence**.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

1.	Select the tags that you want to apply to the sequence.

    The tags you select are highlighted in blue, and they're also listed with their full hierarchy path in the **Selected tags** section.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

## Apply tags to a sequence

With the Salesperson role, you can't create, edit, or delete tags. However, if tags are created by your sales manager or administrator, you can apply them to sequences.

1. Sign in to your sales app and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **Personal settings**.   
1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequences**.   
1.	Select a sequence for which you want to apply tags, and then select **Edit tags**.    
    
    >[!NOTE]
    >You can also select the **Edit tags** option by opening the sequence.   
    
    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select Edit tag for a sequence.](media/sa-sequence-tags-apply-tag-select-edit-tag.png "Select Edit tag for a sequence")

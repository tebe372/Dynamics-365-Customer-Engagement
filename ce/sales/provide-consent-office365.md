# Provide consent to collect data from Microsoft 365  

Dynamics 365 Sales uses Microsoft 365 data to generate the following insights based on users' email interactions and meetings:

- [Relationship analytics KPIs and health score](relationship-analytics.md)
- [Who knows whom suggestions](who-knows-whom.md)

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, and Microsoft 365 <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | Microsoft 365 administrator <br> |


## Things to consider

Before you provide consent, review the following information:

- Both relationship analytics and who knows whom require the same consent. You only need to consent once.

- The consent applies to all the Dynamics 365 applications that require permission to access Microsoft 365 data.

- When consent is provided, Dynamics 365 analyzes Exchange emails pertaining to the last one year to provide relationship insights and who knows whom suggestions. The analysis is done in 12 batches, with each batch containing emails from one month. Dynamics 365 can handle up to 8 million emails per batch in this process. The live data is then processed after every 24 hours.

- When you withdraw consent, the system can take up to 24 hours to remove data from all apps and up to 30 days to remove backed-up data from Microsoft 365 storage accounts.

# Provide consent to collect data from Exchange Online  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization is a relationship intelligence customer and you've provided consent in **Microsoft 365 admin center** > **Settings** > **Org settings** > **Dynamics 365 Sales Insights â€“ Analytics**, the consent is valid until September 2022. After that, you'll need to provide consent as shown here. We recommend that you use the following method to provide consent as early as possible before your existing consent expires.

Relationship analytics and health scores that include insights from Exchange Online are more accurate than those that include only data from Dynamics 365. However, an Office 365 administrator must provide consent for Dynamics 365 to collect information from your organization's Exchange server.  

> [!TIP]
> For more information on how relationship analytics uses Office 365 data, see [Use relationship analytics to gather KPIs](./relationship-analytics.md).

If you're an Office 365 administrator, here's how to provide consent:

1. In **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select **Settings** > **Org settings** > **Dynamics 365 Applications**.

1. Under **Insights for Other Users**, select **Allow individualized insights to be generated and accessed by other users when using Dynamics 365 Applications**, and then select **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The consent you provide applies to all Dynamics 365 apps.

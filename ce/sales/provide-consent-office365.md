# Provide consent to collect data from Exchange Online  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization is an existing relationship intelligence customer and you've provided consent in **Microsoft 365 admin center** > **Settings** > **Org settings** > **Dynamics 365 Sales Insights â€“ Analytics**, the consent is valid until September 2022. After that, you'll need to provide consent as described in this article. We recommend that you provide consent as early as possible to avoid any loss of functionality.

The Relationship analytics and who knows whom features include insights based on email interactions from Exchange Online. 

To enable Dynamics 365 to collect information from your organization's Exchange server, your Office 365 administrator must provide consent to use Exchange data.  

> [!NOTE]
> When the consent is provided, Dynamics 365 analyzes Exchange emails pertaining to last two years.  

If you're an Office 365 administrator, here's how you provide consent:

1. In **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select **Settings** > **Org settings** > **Dynamics 365 Applications**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The consent provided is applicable to all the Dynamics 365 applications that require **Insights for other users** permission.  
4. Save the changes.  
    Dynamics 365 can now connect to the Exchange server to fetch data.

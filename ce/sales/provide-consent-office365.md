# Provide consent to collect data from Microsoft 365  

Dynamics 365 Sales uses Microsoft 365 data for generating the following insights:

- Relationship analytics and health score
- Who knows whom

Previously, the consent for these capabilities were provided from **Microsoft 365 admin center** > **Settings** > **Org settings** > **Dynamics 365 Sales Insights - Analytics** and **Dynamics 365 Sales Insights - Connection graph** respectively. The consents are now consolidated for all the Dynamics 365 applications to use office 365 data.  
   
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization is an existing relationship intelligence customer and you've provided consent in **Microsoft 365 admin center** > **Settings** > **Org settings** > **Dynamics 365 Sales Insights â€“ Analytics**, the consent is valid until September 2022. After that, you'll need to provide consent as described in this article. We recommend that you provide consent as early as possible to avoid any loss of functionality.

The Relationship analytics and who knows whom capabilities in Dynamics 365 Sales include insights based on email interactions from Exchange Online. 

To enable Dynamics 365 to collect information from your organization's Exchange server, your Office 365 administrator must provide consent to use Exchange data.  

> [!NOTE]
> When the consent is provided, Dynamics 365 analyzes Exchange emails pertaining to last two years.  

If you're Microsoft 365 administrator, here's how you provide consent:

1. In **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select **Settings** > **Org settings** > **Dynamics 365 Applications**.

3. Read the description carefully and select the **Insights for other users** option. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >- The consent provided is applicable to all the Dynamics 365 applications that require **Insights for other users** permission.
    >- When disabling these insights, it can take up to 24 hours for the data to be removed from all apps and up to 30 days for backed-up data to be removed from Microsoft 365 storage accounts.  

4. Save the changes.  
    Dynamics 365 applications can access the exchange data.

## Opt out security groups or users

As a Microsoft 365 admin, you can opt out certain security groups and users of sharing their communication and collaboration data. For example, you may want to opt out the senior leadership team.

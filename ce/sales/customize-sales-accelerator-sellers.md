The personalize sales accelerator settings allows sellers determine what happens when you complete an activity. 

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise<br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator <br>  More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|


## What can you configure?

As an administrator or sequence manager, you can configure sequences by using the following options to allow sellers to customize and personalize their experience:

- [Seller availability](#seller-availability)
- [Sequence activities](#sequence-activities)
- [Sequence reporting](#enable-sales-accelerator-reports)
- [Phone number priority](#phone-number-priority) 

## Seller availability

Configure seller availability options to allow sellers to set working hours and vacation days so that sequence steps, leads, and opportunities can be assigned accordingly.

Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** ![change area.](media/change-area-icon.png) > **Sales Insights settings**.    

2. On the site map, under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequences**.    

3. On the **Sequences** page, select **Settings**.    

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select Settings.](media/sa-sequence-settings.png "Select Settings")        

4. On the **Settings** page, select **Seller availability**.      

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select Seller availability on the settings page.](media/sa-configure-seller-availability.png "Select Seller availability on the settings page")   

5. Configure the following options: 
    - Select the **Seller availability settings** toggle.
    - Under **Select a calendar**, choose a calendar type from which sellers can configure work hours and vacation days so that leads and opportunities can be assigned based on sellers' availability: 
        - **CRM calendar** allows sellers to configure work hours and vacation days through the Dynamics 365 calendar in personal settings. By default, this option is selected. More information [Configure your work availability](personalize-sales-accelerator.md#configure-your-work-availability)
        - **Outlook** allows sellers to configure work hours and vacation days through the Outlook calendar. Before you select this option, verify that [server-side synchronization of email, appointments, contacts, and tasks](/power-platform/admin/set-up-server-side-synchronization-of-email-appointments-contacts-and-tasks?context=/dynamics365/context/sales-context) is configured for your organization.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Enable the option to allow sellers to set working hours and vacation days.](media/sa-enable-seller-availability.png "Enable the option to allow sellers to set working hours and vacation days")   

6. Select **Save**.

## Sequence activities

Configure the linking of sequence steps and activities to automatically create linked activities for sellers' upcoming sequence steps. Linked activities are added to seller timelines for the next sequence step.

Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** ![change area.](media/change-area-icon.png) > **Sales Insights settings**.    

2. On the site map under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequence**.    

3. On the **Sequences** page, select **Settings**.    

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select Settings.](media/sa-sequence-settings.png "Select Settings")        

4. On the **Settings** page, select **Sequence activities**.      

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select Sequence activities on the settings page.](media/sa-configure-sequence-activities.png "Select Sequence activities on the settings page")  

5. Turn on the **Create linked activities** toggle.

    Select the **Exclude phone call activities** checkbox to avoid creating a duplicate phone call activity when you're using Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework as your phone system. If you don't select this option, a duplicate phone call activity will be created on the timeline and a duplicate activity will be created when the step is waiting to be completed on the record.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Enable Create linked activities.](media/sa-personal-settings-enable-precreate-linked-activities.png "Enable Create linked activities")

    >[!NOTE]
    >When turned off, activities will not be created automatically. However, activities are created on the timeline only when sellers select the activity in the **Up next** widget.   
 
6. Configure activities and steps. You can choose how the actions that sellers perform on steps will affect linked activities and sequence steps.

    | Action | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | When a seller completes any activity(other than a phone call), the linked step also gets completed. | When you select this checkbox and sellers complete the activity through the timeline, the sequence step that's related to this activity is automatically marked as complete.|
    | When a seller completes a phone call, the linked step also gets completed. | When you select this checkbox and sellers make a phone call through the timeline, the sequence step that's related to this activity is automatically marked as complete. |
    | When seller marks a phone call sequence step as complete | When sellers complete a phone call activity in the sequence step, you can choose to let sellers enter the status of the activity or enter a default value that has been defined for your organization. |
    
    >[!NOTE]
    >Select the **Lock settings so sellers can't modify them** checkbox to prevent sellers from updating the sequence activities configuration.

7. Select **Save**.

## Sequence reporting 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Enable sales accelerator reports to help your sales manager view and understand their team's historical operational metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and sequence stats page.   

Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** ![change area.](media/change-area-icon.png) > **Sales Insights settings**.    

2. On the site map under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequence**.    

3. On the **Sequences** page, select **Settings**.    

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select Settings.](media/sa-sequence-settings.png "Select Settings")        

4. On the **Settings** page, select **Sequence reporting**.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Enable sales acceleration reporting.](media/sa-enable-sales-acceleration-reporting.png "Enable sales acceleration reporting")        

5. Turn on the toggle.   

6. In the confirmation message, select **Enable**. 

By default, users with sales manager and sequence manager roles can view the reports. To grant view access to other roles, provide read access at the organizational level for the sales acceleration reports table. More information: [Security roles and privileges](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges)

>[!NOTE]
>After you enable the option, the application might take up to 24 hours to display the data in the reports. Subsequently, the reports will be refreshed every 24 hours. You can view the last updated date in the upper-right corner of the sales acceleration report page.

To know how sales managers use: 

-	Metrics and KPIs, go to [Understand sales acceleration reporting](understand-sales-acceleration-reporting.md).
-	Sequence stats, go to [Understand sequence stats](understand-sequence-stats.md).

## Phone number priority

When a phone system is configured in your organization, sellers can make calls directly through the sales accelerator feature. Under **Phone number priority**, select the phone numbers for **Default**, **Fallback1**, and **Fallback2**. When sellers initiate calls through a sequence step or the work list, the softphone chooses the phone numbers in the order they're listed.

For example, you can select **Business Phone** in **Default**, **Mobile Phone** in **Fallback1**, and **Home Phone** in **Fallback2**. When sellers initiate a call, the number in the **Default** option is dialed if it's available. If it isn't available, the call goes to the next option.

Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** ![change area.](media/change-area-icon.png) > **Sales Insights settings**.    

2. On the site map under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequence**.    

3. On the **Sequences** page, select **Settings**.    

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select settings.](media/sa-sequence-settings.png "Select settings")        

4. On the **Settings** page, select **Phone number priority**.      
    
    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Configure the phone number priority for calling customers.](media/sa-phone-number-priority.png "Configure the phone number priority for calling customers")      

5. Select phone number options for **Default**, **Fallback1**, and **Fallback2**.

6. Select **Save**.

>[!NOTE]
>For opportunities, the phone number priority will be applied to the primary contacts.

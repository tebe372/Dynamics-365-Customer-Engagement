# Use the Sales Hub app to access Dynamics 365 Sales features

Sales Hub is a free app from Microsoft that's preinstalled. It comes with several core and premium features to help you quickly get started with Dynamics 365 Sales. From the Sales Hub app, you can access Sales Premium features&mdash;such as sales accelerator, conversation intelligence, and predictive scoring&mdash;even if you have a Sales Enterprise license. Premium features are subject to monthly capacity limits for Sales Enterprise customers. For more information, go to [Digital selling capabilities in Sales Enterprise](digital-selling.md).

We recommend you use the Sales Hub app unless your organization follows unique sales practices that warrant a custom app. For a comparison, refer to [Sales Hub app versus custom app](saleshub-customapp.md).

## What's in the Sales Hub app?

The Sales Hub app has a modern interface that's designed to simplify your day-to-day sales activities. All the information you need is in one place, so you can focus on the activities that need your attention.

Sales Hub is based on the Unified Interface framework, which offers the following benefits:

- A modern, seamless, and intuitive user interface

- An adaptive UI that renders content according to the device it runs on

- An accessible UI

- A built-in mobile app that lets you complete tasks on the go

## Why should you use the Sales Hub app?

Sales Hub is a Microsoft first-party app that's designed for ideal seller experiences. Use the Sales Hub app to:

- Harness the power of data and intelligence to forecast, compare annual projections, and measure performance using predictive scoring

- Collaborate using Teams in Dynamics 365 to accelerate your pipeline while managers track team performance and provide coaching to increase customer satisfaction

- Access standard (and premium, if licensed) sales features almost instantly

- Access preview features with minimal setup

- [Access premium features with a limited monthly capacity](digital-selling.md) (Sales Enterprise users only)

- Customize the app and configure features as required

Use the Microsoft documentation to train your sales organization, too. The documentation is based on the Sales Hub app, so there's no need to create custom documentation.

The Sales Hub app can coexist with any custom sales apps that you might have in your organization. [Learn the benefits of using the Sales Hub app versus custom apps](saleshub-customapp.md).

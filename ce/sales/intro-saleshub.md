# Use the Sales Hub app to access Dynamics 365 Sales features

Sales Hub is a free app from Microsoft. It's preinstalled and comes with several core sales and sales premium features to help you get started using Dynamics 365 Sales quickly.  

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you use the Sales Hub app unless your organization follows unique sales practices that warrant a custom app. For a comparison, see [Sales Hub app versus custom app](saleshub-customapp.md).

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
| --- | --- |
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise (for more information, see [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/)) |
| **Security roles** | Any primary sales role, such as salesperson or sales manager (for more information, see [Primary sales roles](security-roles-for-sales.md#primary-sales-roles)) |

## What's in the Sales Hub app?

The Sales Hub app has a modern interface that's designed to simplify your day-to-day sales activities. See all the information you need in one place, and focus on the activities that need your attention.

Sales Hub is based on the Unified Interface framework. Highlights include:

- A modern, seamless, and intuitive user interface

- An adaptive UI that renders content according to the device it runs on

- A built-in mobile app that lets you complete tasks on the go

- An accessible UI

## Why should you use the Sales Hub app?

Sales Hub is a Microsoft first-party app that's designed for ideal seller experiences. Use the Sales Hub app to:

- Harness the power of data and intelligence to forecast, compare annual projections, and measure performance using predictive scoring.

- Collaborate using Teams from within Dynamics 365 to accelerate your pipeline while managers track team performance and provide coaching to increase customer satisfaction.

- Access standard (and premium, if licensed) sales features almost instantly.

- Access preview features with minimal setup.

- Access premium features, for a specific period, when they're made available (Sales Enterprise users only).

- Customize the app and configure features as required.

Use the Microsoft documentation to train your sales organization, too. The documentation is based on the Sales Hub app, so there's no need to create custom documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> The Sales Hub app can coexist with any custom sales apps that you might have in your organization. To learn the benefits of using the Sales Hub app, see [Sales Hub app versus custom app](saleshub-customapp.md).

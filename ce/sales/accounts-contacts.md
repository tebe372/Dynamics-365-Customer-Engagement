# Work with accounts and contacts

Account and contact records store much of the information that you and your team collect from your customers. You store data about companies you do business with in accounts. Similar to Microsoft Office Outlook or other email programs, you store data about the people you know and work with in contacts.

Usually, an account has more than one contact associated with it, especially when you're working with a larger company with many departments or locations and you deal with several people to manage the account.

You can create accounts and contacts manually or import them from a spreadsheet or other supported files. 

## Create an account or contact

**To create an account:**

1. In the Sales Hub site map, select **Accounts**.

1. Specify the details that you know about the company and save the changes.

## Make calls with Teams  

You can use Microsoft Teams to call a customer directly from the dialer, a record, or a work item. 

>[!NOTE]
>Verify that a valid phone number is associated with the Dynamics 365 records or work item.  

**To call a customer through a Dynamics 365 record** 

1.	Open a record. In this example, we're opening a contact record.

    In the **Business Phone** field, a phone number has been associated with the contact **Anthony Pruitt**.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Open a contact record.](media/teams-dialer-contact-record.png "Open a contact record")

2.	Select ![Phone icon.](media/phone-icon.png "Phone icon") corresponding to the phone number. The call is established.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select the phone icon to make call.](media/teams-dialer-make-call.png "Select the phone icon to make call")
  
3. (Optional) Select the ellipses (three-dots menu) in the dialer screen to change your microphone and speaker settings. 

**To call a customer from a work list item**

1.	Go to **My Work** > **Sales accelerator**.

    Your work list opens. You can see the phone call activities that are pending for the day. In this example, the phone call activity for **Nancy Anderson** is pending for the day.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Open your work list.](media/teams-dialer-open-work-list.png "Open your work list")

2.	Select ![Phone icon.](media/phone-icon.png "Phone icon") corresponding to the work item.    
    The Teams dialer opens, and the call is established.   

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can also use the **Call** option in the **Up next** widget to make the call.


**To call a customer manually**

1. Open the Teams dialer.

2. Enter the phone number of the customer, or search for the customer through dialer search box.   
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Search for or call a phone number manually.](media/teams-dialer-call-number-manually.png "Search for or call a phone number manually") 

3.  Select **Call**.

## Receive Teams calls in Dynamics 365

You can receive calls in Dynamics 365 Sales. When a call is received, a notification is displayed in the upper-right corner of the page, as shown in the following image:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Call receiving notification in Teams.](media/teams-dialer-receive-call-notification.png "Call receiving notification in Teams")    

The caller name is automatically displayed when the phone number is associated with a record. For example, Kenny Smith is a lead and has the mobile number +1 123 456 7890 associated with his record. When you receive a call from +1 123 456 7890, the name Kenny Smith is automatically displayed; you can select the name in the notification to open the record. 

> [!NOTE]
> If a phone number is associated with more than one record, the notification will display up to 3 records and will indicate more records exist with this phone number. Select the appropriate record.

To receive the call, select **Answer**. The Teams telephony panel opens and the call is connected. 

A phone call activity is created and displayed on the timeline of the record. If the phone number is automatically resolved to a record, the **Call From** and **Regarding** fields of the phone call activity are automatically populated. If the received call isn't associated with any record, only a phone call activity is created. To associate the call with a record during the call, select the **Details** tab and then select **Connect a record**.

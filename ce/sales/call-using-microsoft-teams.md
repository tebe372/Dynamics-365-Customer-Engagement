## Make calls using Teams  

You can use Microsoft Teams to call a customer directly through the dial pad, a record, or a work item to make a call. 

>[!NOTE]
>Verify that a valid phone number is associated with the Dynamics 365 records or work item.  

**To dial a customer through a Dynamics 365 record** 

1.	Open a record. In this example, weâ€™re opening a contact record.    
    In the **Business Phone** field, a phone number has been associated with the contact **Nancy Anderson**.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Open contact record.](media/teams-dialer-contact-record.png "Open contact record")    

2.	Select the phone icon (![Phone icon.](media/phone-icon.png "Phone icon")) corresponding to the phone number and the call is established.

**To dial a customer work list item**

    Your work list opens. You can see the phone call activities that are pending for the day. In this example, the phone call activity for **Nancy Anderson** is pending for the day.

    The Teams dialer opens, and the call is established.   

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can also use the **Call** option in the **Up next** widget to make the call.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select phone icon to make call through work item.](media/teams-dialer-work-item-make-call.png "Select phone icon to make call through work item")    

## Receive calls using Teams

Through Teams you can receive calls in Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app. To receive a call, open any record such as lead, contact, or work list item. A notification is displayed at the bottom-right corner of the page as shown in the following image:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Call receiving notification in Teams.](media/teams-dialer-receive-call-notification.png "Call receiving notification in Teams")    

When a call is received, the caller name is automatically displayed when the phone number is associated with a record. For example, Kenny Smith is lead and has the mobile number +1 123 456 7890 associated with his lead record. When you receive a call from +1 123 456 7890, the name Kenny Smith is automatically displayed and select the name to open the record. 

To receive the call, select **Answer**. The Teams telephony panel opens and the call is connected. A phone call activity is created and appears on the timeline of the record. If the received call is not associated with any record, only a phone call activity is created.

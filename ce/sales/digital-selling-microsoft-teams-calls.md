# Microsoft Teams calls with conversation intelligence

Set up integrated Teams calls with conversation intelligence so your sellers can call customers directly from Dynamics 365 and get real-time insights, rich call summaries, and more.

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |

| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |

## Overview

Microsoft Teams dialer helps sellers to be more productive and get work done more effectively by calling customers directly from within the Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app. More information: [Call using Microsoft Teams](call-using-microsoft-teams.md)

Conversation intelligence uses analytics and data science to gather data from sellers' call recordings and Dynamics 365 Sales. Conversation intelligence analyzes the data to provide you with the information and insights to intelligently manage your sales team and proactively coach sellers.

## Licensing options

When you set up Microsoft Teams calls with conversation intelligence with the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license, there's no limit on the number of calls made through Microsoft Teams. However, you get three hours of conversation intelligence per month, per user. If you need more than three hours of conversation intelligence per month, per user, then you can [buy additional hours](faqs-sales-insights.md#how-do-i-buy-more-conversation-intelligence-hours). Note that three hours of conversation intelligence refers to recording and processing time. For a detailed list of conversation intelligence capabilities available with the Sales Premium and Sales Enterprise licenses, see [this FAQ](faqs-sales-insights.md#which-conversation-intelligence-features-are-available-in-dynamics-365-sales-versus-viva-sales).

## Set up Microsoft Teams calls with conversation intelligence

1. On the **Get started with digital sales** page, under **Microsoft Teams calls with conversation intelligence**, select **Quick setup**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/ds-ci-setup.png" alt-text="Teams calls + conversation intelligence quick setup panel.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > To use Teams calls, sellers will need valid licenses for Microsoft Teams, Phone System, and Calling Plan or Direct Routing, in addition to assigned phone numbers. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2180901)

2. Turn on **Teams calls**.  
    
    By default, the following options are turned on:
    - **Answer incoming calls in Dynamics 365**
        Allows sellers to receive Teams calls in Dynamics 365 Sales. If you turn it off, sellers can only make outgoing Teams calls from within Dynamics 365.
    - **Internal call will ring only in the Teams app, not in Dynamics 365**
        Indicates that calls from internal users won't ring and won't be tracked in Dynamics 365. In this case, calls from external contacts will ring in Dynamics 365 and internal calls will ring only in Teams. You can clear the checkbox if you want sellers to receive both external and internal calls in Dynamics 365.  
 

    - In the **Enable for** section, select one of the following options to provide permissions to users to view Microsoft Teams dialer:
        - **All security roles**: Select this option to provide access to view Microsoft Teams dialer to users in all the security roles in your organization.
        - **Specific security roles**: Select this option to specify security roles when you want to give access to view Microsoft Teams dialer to specific users.

3. Turn on the **Recording with real-time transcription and insights** toggle to allow sellers to record calls by using the Teams dialer and get the most out of every call with advanced conversation intelligence capabilities such as AI-powered insights, rich call summaries, and more.

    - In the **Enable for** section, select one of the following options to provide permissions to users to record calls:
        - **All security roles**: Select this option to allow call recording by all the security roles in your organization.
        - **Specific security roles**: Select this option to allow call recording only by specific security roles.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > - To implement the call recording capability in your entire organization, select **All security roles**.
    > - For a phased implementation in your organization, create different security roles for each group of users and then assign the security role accordingly.

4. Select **Update**.

After settings are enabled, sellers can make Teams calls to their customers from within the Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app. They can also record the calls and apply conversation intelligence capabilities to get the most out of every call.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also enable Teams calling for other apps from the **Advanced settings** option on the **Microsoft Teams calls** setup page. More information: [Configure Microsoft Teams dialer](configure-microsoft-teams-dialer.md)

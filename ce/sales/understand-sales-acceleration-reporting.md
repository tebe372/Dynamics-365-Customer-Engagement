## What is sales acceleration reporting?

Sales acceleration reporting gives you a broad overview of the sequences related to leads and opportunities in your organization. The reports use AI to provide insights into which sequences are doing better and emerging with the highest conversion rates.<!--note from editor: Or it could be "...emerging with the most successful conversion rates."--> Also, you can analyze metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify areas for improvement that might have the greatest effect on sales growth.

## Understand sales acceleration reporting

By default, the report displays KPIs for all sequences that are related to leads and opportunities over the past month. The reporting view can be categorized into the following sections:

-	[Data filters](#data-filters)
-	[KPI summary charts](#kpi-summary-charts)
-	[Metric charts](#metric-charts)

### Data filters

Use the data filtering options to select data for specific time periods, entity type, sequence name, sequence owner, seller, and territory. To filter data by duration, channel, queue, or agent, select a value from the respective dropdown list.

### KPI summary charts

The KPI summary charts summarize the key performance indicators for the specified time period and the percent change during the period. You can further filter these areas by entity type, sequence name, sequence owner, seller, and territory. Also, a trend is displayed corresponding to the value specifying how the KPI is doing in the selected timeframe when compared with the previous timeframe. A green upward triangle indicates an improvement in the score, and a red downward triangle indicates a decline in the score.

The following table shows the KPIs that are displayed in the report.

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Lead conversion rate | The percentage of leads in a sequence that are successfully converted into opportunities. |
| Avg.time (in days) for lead conversion | The average number of days<!--note from editor: Edit okay?--> a lead takes to be converted to an opportunity when it's connected to a sequence. |
| Avg.time (in days) for sequence completion | The average number of days it takes for a sequence to be completed in an attached record. |
| Opportunity-to-win ratio | The percentage of opportunities in a sequence that are successfully converted into win deals. |
| Avg.time (in days) for opportunity conversion | The average number of days that it takes for an opportunity in a sequence to be converted into a win deal. |

### Metric charts

The metric chart provides a detailed view into the individual values of a sequence, such as status, number of steps, and the status of the steps.

To view specific data that's related to a value in the charts, select the value. Other metric charts in the report will be refreshed to show data that's related to the value you select. Drilling down into these values helps you to identify the areas of improvements for the sequence.

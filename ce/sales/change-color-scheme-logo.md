# Set up branding and theming

You can create a custom look and feel (a theme), for your app by making changes to the default colors and visual elements provided in the uncustomized system. For example, you can create your personal product branding by adding a company logo and providing table-specific coloring. The theme colors are applied globally throughout the application.

## Prerequisites

To use Sales Copilot, your administrator must have [enabled and set it up](enable-setup-copilot.md). 

## Launch Sales Copilot

Sales Copilot launches automatically when you access the Sales Hub app. If it's closed, launch it from the Sales Hub app by selecting the Sales Copilot icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/copilot-icon.png" border="false":::) in the right most bar.

### Summarize an opportunity or a lead

Use the `Summarize opportunity` or `Summarize lead` prompt to get a quick summary of an opportunity or lead. The summary is generated from the fields in the default opportunity or lead view. Start typing the opportunity or lead name after the @ symbol. Copilot will suggest the records that match your search. Select the record that you want to get a summary of.  

You can get the summary generated from the fields that matter to you the most. For example, let's say that estimated revenue, close date, contact, BPF stage, and proposed solution are the first few things that you look for in an opportunity. Work with your administrator to [configure these fields for summarization](configure-sales-copilot.md#configure-record-summary-and-catch-up-fields). Now, when you ask copilot to summarize an opportunity, you'll get a summary of the opportunity record that includes configured fields. These fields are configurable at the organization level. Ensure that your entire sales team agrees on the top seven fields that are most relevant for your business.

The following screenshot is an example of an opportunity summary generated by Sales Copilot:

#### Lead enrichment with Sales Copilot

Sales Copilot enriches your leads with data from Dynamics 365 Sales, LinkedIn and Bing. 

- Possible contacts for a lead, based on the lead name, Phone number, email, company name.

- Latest news updates on the account, curated from Bing.  
- Suggested profiles of the contact from LinkedIn, if you have the LinkedIn Sales Navigator license.  
 
After you select a suggested contact, Copilot generates a summary of fields that can be updated in the lead based on information from the selected contact and the account associated with it. For example, let's say you selected Kiana Anderson from Contoso as your contact, Copilot will suggest the fields in the lead form that can be updated with details from Kiana and Contoso.

### Catch up with an opportunity or lead

Use the `Catchup with opportunity` or `Catchup with lead` prompt to catch up on the updates to your opportunity or lead records since the last seven days or the last login. The catch up information is generated from the audit history. If you don't see any catch up information, ensure that your administrator has [turned on audit and granted you access](enable-setup-copilot.md#grant-audit-access-to-users).

By default, Copilot summarizes the last 10 updates to the record from the audit history. However, you can work with your administrator to [configure specific fields for catch up](configure-sales-copilot.md#configure-record-summary-and-catch-up-fields) so that you stay updated on changes to fields that matter to you the most.. These fields are configurable at the organization level. Ensure that your entire sales team agrees on the top 10 fields that are most relevant for your business.

### Prepare for upcoming meetings

Use the `Prepare for upcoming meetings` prompt to get a list of meetings in the next 24 hours on your calendar. After you select the meeting that you'd like to prepare for, Copilot generates a summary based on the last three Notes (recorded in the last 3 months) and the most recent email thread associated with the timeline of the related record.  

### Show latest news for an account

Use the `Show latest news for account` prompt to get the latest news about an account, curated from Bing. Sales Copilot lists articles featuring or mentioning the account. These news updates can be great conversation starters and help you understand the current dynamics in your customers' organization. Ensure to read through the news article thoroughly to confirm that it's from an authentic source and it's indeed about the customer.

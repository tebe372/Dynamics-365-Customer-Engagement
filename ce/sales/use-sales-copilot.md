## Summarize an opportunity

Use the `Summarize opportunity` prompt to get a quick summary of an opportunity, generated from the fields in the opportunity form. Start typing the opportunity name after the @ symbol. Copilot will suggest the opportunity names that match your search. Select the opportunity that you want to get a summary of.  

You can get the summary generated from the fields that matter to you the most. For example, let's say that estimated revenue, close date, contact, BPF stage, and proposed solution are the first few things that you look for in an opportunity. Work with your administrator to configure these fields for summarization. Now, when you ask copilot to summarize an opportunity, you'll get a summary of the opportunity record that includes configured fields. These fields are configurable at the organization level. Ensure that your entire sales team agrees on the top seven fields that are most relevant to your business.

The following screenshot is an example of an opportunity summary generated by Sales Copilot:

## Summarize a lead

Use the `Summarize lead` prompt to get a quick summary of a lead, generated from the fields in the lead form. Start typing the lead name after the @ symbol. Copilot will suggest the lead names that match your search. Select the lead that you want to get a summary of.  

You can get the summary generated from the fields that matter to you the most. Work with your administrator to configure the fields for summarization. These fields are configurable at the organization level. Ensure that your entire sales team agrees on the top seven fields that are most relevant to your business.

Copilot can also suggest possible contacts for a lead. After you select a suggested contact, Copilot generates a summary of fields that can be updated in the lead based on information from the selected contact and the account associated with it. For example, let's say you selected Kiana Anderson from Contoso as your contact, Copilot will suggest the fields in the lead form that can be updated with details from Kiana and Contoso. 

## Catch up with an opportunity

Use the `Catchup with opportunity` prompt to catch up on the updates to your opportunity since the last seven days or the last login. Stay on top of your opportunities and leads by asking Copilot to summarize the changes to fields that matter to you the most. For example, let's say that you want to stay on top of changes to close date, estimated revenue, and contact. Work with your administrator to configure these fields for catch up. These fields are configurable at the organization level. Ensure that your entire sales team agrees on the top 10 fields that are most relevant to your business. The catch up information is generated from the audit history.

The following table lists the requests you can make to Sales Copilot.

|Request  |Response  |

For example, let's say you selected Kiana Anderson from Contoso as your contact, Copilot will suggest the fields in the lead form that can be filled from Kiana and Contoso's details. You can choose whether you want to update the details or not.          |
|Catchup with opportunity      | Summarizes the changes to the given opportunity since the last seven days, based on fields configured by your administrator.

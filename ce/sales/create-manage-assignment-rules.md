# Manage assignment rules for routing 

Assignment rules enable new leads and opportunities to be automatically assigned to sellers or sales teams. This helps reduce the amount of time and effort required to manually assign records, prevent the loss of unassigned records, and balance assignments among sellers.

## License and role requirements

| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |

## Use the assignment rules designer

As an administrator or sequence manager, you can create rules that match lead or opportunity attributes (such as location and language) with seller or team attributes (such as location and language). For example, when a lead is created and satisfies the conditions of a specific rule, the lead is automatically assigned to a seller.

You can use the assignment rules designer to do the following tasks:

- [Create and activate an assignment rule](create-and-activate-assignment-rule.md).
- [Edit an assignment rule](edit-assignment-rule.md).
- [Delete or deactivate an assignment rule](delete-deactivate-assignment-rule.md). 
- [Manage sales teams](manage-sales-teams.md).
- [Manage seller attributes](manage-seller-attributes.md).

## Review the prerequisites

Before you start, be sure the sales accelerator feature is configured in your organization. More information: [Configure the sales accelerator](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md)

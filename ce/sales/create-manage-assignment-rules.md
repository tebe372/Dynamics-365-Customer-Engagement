# Automatically assign leads and opportunities

Assignment rules automatically route new leads and opportunities to the right sellers or sales teams. Sales managers spend less time and effort in manual assignment, leads and opportunities don't go overlooked, and assignments are balanced among your salespeople.

The sales accelerator's assignment rules designer makes creating and managing assignment rules quick and easy. Watch this brief video to learn more.

### Prerequisites

[Sales accelerator is configured for your organization](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md).

## Use the assignment rules designer

As an administrator or sequence manager, you can create rules that match attributes of leads and opportunities with attributes of your sales team. When a lead is created and satisfies the conditions of a specific rule, the rule assigns the lead to a seller automatically.

Use the assignment rules designer to:

- [Create and activate an assignment rule](create-and-activate-assignment-rule.md).
- [Edit an assignment rule](edit-assignment-rule.md).
- [Delete or deactivate an assignment rule](delete-deactivate-assignment-rule.md).
- [Manage sales teams](manage-sales-teams.md).
- [Manage seller attributes](manage-seller-attributes.md).

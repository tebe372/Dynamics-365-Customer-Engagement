# Relationship analytics and KPIs overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is intended to help sellers or sales managers enhance their teamâ€™s performance. This feature is not intended for use in making, and should not be used to make, decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring, recording, and storing communications with end users. This also includes adequately notifying end users that their communications with sales persons may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their sales persons that their communications with end users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.

Relationship analytics uses the activity history of a seller with a contact or account and calculates KPIs based on their interactions. The KPIs are available at various levels such as, contact, account, opportunity, and lead. The graphical display of the KPIs help you quickly identify relationships that need to be nurtured and the KPIs to be improved for the same.  

Relationship analytics help sales professionals and managers answer questions such as:  

- Which opportunities should I spend my time on?  
- Do we have a good relationship with the customer?  
- How much time have we spent with our customer?  
- When was the last time we contacted them?  
- When is the next time we will contact them?  
- How many emails and meetings have we exchanged?  
- What is the customer's response rate?  
- How many activities were initiated by the customer?  
- How long does it take our team to respond?  

Depending on your license and configuration, you get the following insights:
 
- Basic relationship insights
- Enhanced relationship insights

## Basic relationship insights

[!INCLUDE[cc-early-access](../includes/cc-early-access.md)]

Basic relationship insights are generated out-of-the-box by using emails and appointments sent and received from Dynamics 365. The seller-customer interaction history is used to calculate KPIs and understand who knows whom. For information on how to view the insights, see [View relationship analytics and KPIs](relationship-analytics.md#view-relationship-analytics-and-kpis). 

The following screenshot displays the widgets that are available out-of-the-box in the **Relationship Analytics** tab of a lead. Similar widgets are also available in Contact, Account, and Opportunity entities.

   |**Field**  |**Deal manager Settings**  |**Deal manager workspace** |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |**Type**     | URL        | URL        |
    |**URL**     |```/main.aspx?appid=860f4439-9cf8-ea11-a813-000d3a54419d&pagetype=control&controlName=MscrmControls.Sales.DealManagerSettings.DealManagerSettings```|```/main.aspx?pagetype=control&controlName=MscrmControls.Sales.DealManager.DealManager&data={"entityType":"opportunity"}```|
    |**Title**     |Deal manager settings         |Deal manager         |
    |**Advanced** > **Privileges** > **Entity**     |Deal manager settings         |dealmanageraccess         |

1. After selecting the entity, select the **+** icon to update the privilege for the entity. 
    By default, all the privileges are selected.

1. Save and publish the changes. 

1. Open your custom app, and verify that you're able to access the deal manager settings and workspace pages that you just added.

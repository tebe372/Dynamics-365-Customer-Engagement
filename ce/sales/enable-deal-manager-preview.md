    :::image type="content" source="media/appdesigner-subarea.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of the subarea component in the App designer."::: 
1. Update the following fields:
    - **Type:** URL
    - **URL:** 
        ```/main.aspx?appid=860f4439-9cf8-ea11-a813-000d3a54419d&pagetype=control&controlName=MscrmControls.Sales.DealManagerSettings.DealManagerSettings```
    - **Title:** Deal manager settings
    - **Advanced** > **Privileges** > **Entity**: Deal manager settings

1. After selecting the entity, select the **+** icon to update the privilege for the entity.  
    By default, all the privileges are selected. 

1. Clear all the checkboxes and select only the **Read** privilege.  
    This step ensures that only the security roles that you've granted access to can see and access the deal manager settings from the site map. 
      > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you don't update the privilege, the deal manager related pages will be visible to all the users irrespective of their security role.
1. Repeat steps 5 through 8 to add the deal manager workspace page to your sitemap with the following values:
    - **Type:** URL
    - **URL:** 
        ```/main.aspx?pagetype=control&controlName=MscrmControls.Sales.DealManager.DealManager&data={"entityType":"opportunity"}```
    - **Title:** Deal manager
    - **Advanced** > **Privileges** > **Entity**: dealmanageraccess   

1. Save and publish the changes.

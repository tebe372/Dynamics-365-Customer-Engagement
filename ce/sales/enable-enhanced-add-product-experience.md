## Enable or disable the enhanced experience

Depending on the Dynamics 365 Sales license you have, select one of the following tabs for specific information:

If you have the Sales Hub app, follow the instructions in this tab. Otherwise, follow the instructions in the **Sales Professional** tab to configure the option in Power Platform.

1. In lower-left corner of the screen, select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area"), and then select **App Settings**.

2. Under **Product Catalog**, select **Product Catalog Settings**.

3. On the **Product Catalog Settings** page, toggle **Adding products (preview)** to enable or disable the preview.  
    If you enable the preview, you'll see additional options for customizing the new **Add products** dialog box.

     You can either add more columns to the grid or add more attributes to the **Product** column in the dialog box. For more information, see [Preview: Customize the Add Products dialog box](customize-add-products-dialog-box.md).
    
    If you disable the preview, the **Add products** option in the opportunity, quote, order, and invoice will switch back to **Quick create** form.

# [Sales Professional](#tab/SP)

If you're using a custom app or Sales Professional app, you can enable or disable the enhanced experience from **System Settings** in Power Platform.

1. In your app, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/settings-icon.png "Settings"), and then select **Advanced Settings**.

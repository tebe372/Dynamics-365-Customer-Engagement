# Group records by segment

Use the work assignment feature in Dynamics 365 Sales to streamline your sales team's workflows. Work assignment uses segments and rules to group and assign records to the appropriate sellers and sequences automatically.

A *segment* is a collection of records that have some common characteristics, such as location, deal value, language, or product. You can create segments for any entity, including custom ones. For example, you can create a segment of leads from the UK who are interested in your premium product.

A *sequence* is a series of activities that are related to a record, such as sending emails, making calls, or setting tasks. You can create sequences for any entity, including custom ones. For example, you can create a sequence of emails to nurture your leads from the UK.

An *assignment rule* is a set of criteria that determines which seller or team gets assigned to a record. You can create assignment rules for any entity, including custom ones. For example, you can create an assignment rule that assigns leads from the UK to your UK sales team.

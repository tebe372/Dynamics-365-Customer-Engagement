# Add contacts relevant for the opportunity

When you're working on an opportunity, you'll be interacting with several people, both internally and externally. These users are broadly categorized as stakeholders, sales team, and competitors. Capturing all such details helps your team and leadership get a good view of the opportunity at hand.

## Add stakeholders and decision makers for the opportunity

A stakeholder can be a decision maker or any person who will be working with you on the opportunity from the customer's end. Other stakeholder categories include Champion, End User, Economic Buyer, Influencer, and Technical Buyer.

**To add stakeholders and other stakeholder categories:**

1. In the Sales Hub site map, select **Opportunities**.

1. Open the opportunity.
1. In the Summary tab, go to the **Stakeholders** section.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you'd selected a user in the **Contact** field, that user is automatically added to the **Stakeholders** section.
1. Select **+ New Connection** and then select the stakeholder's record from the contacts list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the **+ New connection** button, navigate to the Connection Associated view for the record and use the **Connect** button to create a new connection. More information: [How are stakeholders and sales team members tracked for opportunities?](stakeholders-sales-team-members.md)

    The user is added as a stakeholder by default. 
1. To convert a stakeholder to any other stakeholder category (for example, decision maker), select the stakeholder record and then select **Edit**.
1. In the **As this role** field, remove Stakeholder and select a role that best fits the contact. For example, select Decision Maker if the contact is a decision maker for the opportunity. 
1. Go back to the opportunity and verify that the stakeholder's role is updated. 

## Add sales team for the opportunity

1. In the Sales Hub site map, select **Opportunities**.

1. Open the opportunity.
1. In the Summary tab, scroll down to the **Sales Team** section.
1. Select **+ New Connection** and then add users or teams in your organization who are involved in the opportunity. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the **+ New connection** button, navigate to the Connection Associated view for the record and use the **Connect** button to create a new connection.

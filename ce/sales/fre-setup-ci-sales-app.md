# First-run setup experience of Microsoft Teams for conversation intelligence

You can configure conversation intelligence with Microsoft Teams. After you sign in to your sales app as an administrator, you can configure the complete application&mdash;enable Microsoft Teams call recording for conversation intelligence, select storage, grant app permissions, and define organization-level tracked keywords and competitors to be used by conversation intelligence.

After configuring conversation intelligence, a sales manager or a seller can view the data and settings that are relevant to them. More information: [Configure sales team-level settings](configure-sales-team-level-settings.md)

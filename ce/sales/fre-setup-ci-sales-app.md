# Set up Microsoft Teams for conversation intelligence

Using Teams together with conversation intelligence in Dynamics 365 Sales helps organizations transform customer interactions into revenue. Calling with Teams allows sellers to view business-critical insights both during the call&mdash;in real-time&mdash;and after.

As an administrator, you can configure conversation intelligence with Microsoft Teams in your sales app. Enable Microsoft Teams call recording for conversation intelligence, select storage, grant app permissions, and define organization-level tracked keywords and competitors. After that, you can [configure sales team-level settings](configure-sales-team-level-settings.md).

If you have the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license, you can enable Teams call recording through quick setup. Go to the **Get started with digital sales** page under **App Settings** in your sales app. Your sellers will get three hours of conversation intelligence per month.

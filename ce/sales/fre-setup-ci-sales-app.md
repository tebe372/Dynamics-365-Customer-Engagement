- Your organization has a Teams phone system installed with a valid license to use it. More information: [Set up Phone System in your organization](/microsoftteams/setting-up-your-phone-system)
- You have a license to use Teams. More information: [Microsoft Teams add-on licenses](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing?tabs=small-business)

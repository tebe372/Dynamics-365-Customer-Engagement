## Overview

Dynamics 365 digital selling capabilities spearhead the digital transformation of sales organizations and constitute the data and productivity first revolution. You can enhance your digital selling programs with Sales Premium features such as the sales accelerator, conversation intelligence, and predictive scoring that are available with the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license. The premium features are available with a limited monthly capacity. If you'd like access to all the [premium features](overview.md#dynamics-365-sales-premium), upgrade to Dynamics 365 Sales Premium.

To use digital selling capabilities, you must have Sales Hub installed. If you don't have the Sales Hub app, you can install it by following the steps described in [Install the Sales solution](set-up-dynamics-365-sales.md#install-the-sales-solution). After the Sales Hub app is installed, you can set up digital selling capabilities from the **Get started with digital sales** page under **App Settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a Dynamics 365 Sales Premium license, you can still use this page to quickly set up the features. The only difference would be that there will be no monthly capacity limit.

# Digital selling capabilities in Sales Enterprise

Use selected Dynamics 365 Sales Premium features (sales accelerator, conversation intelligence, and predictive scoring) with the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license.

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator <br>  More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|


## Overview

Dynamics 365 digital selling capabilities spearhead the digital transformation of sales organizations and constitute the data and productivity first revolution. You can enhance your digital selling programs with Sales Premium features such as the sales accelerator, conversation intelligence, and predictive scoring that are available with the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license. The premium features are available with a limited monthly capacity. If you'd like access to all the [premium features](overview.md#dynamics-365-sales-premium), upgrade to Dynamics 365 Sales Premium.

To use digital selling capabilities, you must have Sales Hub installed. If you don't have the Sales Hub app, you can install it by following the steps described in [Install the Sales solution](set-up-dynamics-365-sales.md#install-the-sales-solution). After the Sales Hub app is installed, you can set up digital selling capabilities from the **Get started with digital sales** page under **App Settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a Dynamics 365 Sales Premium license, you can still use this page to quickly set up the features. The only difference would be that there will be no monthly capacity limit.

## Sales accelerator

The sales accelerator is an engagement platform that helps you understand your customers' needs and respond in meaningful ways. It allows your sellers to engage with your customers by using multiple channels within one workspace. The sales accelerator in Dynamics 365 provides a tailored experience for sellers by minimizing the time they spend on their search for the best next customer to reach out to. It gathers information from multiple sources and lets sellers focus on how to best approach their customers. It helps sellers to sell smartly, by building a strong and prioritized pipeline, offering context, and surfacing automated recommendations throughout a sales sequence that helps to speed the sales process. More information: [What is the sales accelerator?](sales-accelerator-intro.md)

### Licensing options

When you set up the sales accelerator with the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license, you get 1,500 sequence-connected records per month. If you need more than 1,500 sequence-connected records per month, upgrade to Dynamics 365 Sales Premium.

1. On the **Get started with digital sales** page, under **Sales accelerator**, select **Quick setup**.

    The **Sales accelerator quick setup** panel is displayed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The capability to install sample data is available only in your sandbox or trial environments. When you add sample data, you'll also see predictive lead and opportunity scoring on the **Sales Insights** form. Adding the sample data might take a few minutes. If you choose to ignore sample data installation at this point, you can add it later when you need it.

4. In the **Content and layout** section, select the record types and their corresponding related forms that are required in your organization.

    1. To add more record types, select **Add record type**, and then select a record from the dropdown list. The selected record type will display the **Sequence (up next)** widget. You can select out-of-the-box tables—such as **Accounts**, **Contacts**, **Leads**, and **Opportunities**—or custom tables.

       > [!NOTE]
       > - Ensure that the record types you select are the ones that activities are usually connected to. Sales managers use the record types to configure the sequence that will be assigned to records to be displayed in the app.
       > - To view the custom record types in the list, go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System** > **Components** > **Entities**. Under **Communication & Collaboration**, enable the options **Activities**, **Connections**, and **Sending email (If an email field does not exist, one will be created)**.
       > - To add the **Up next** widget to your custom entity form, go to [Add the Up next widget to an entity form](add-upnext-widget-form.md). 

    2. Select a form for the selected record.

       > [!NOTE]
       > - You can remove the record types that no longer need to have automated activities associated with them. Select the **X** icon next to the record type to remove it from the list. Note that if the records in the deleted record type are associated with a sequence, these records will continue to be associated with the sequence.   
       > - To know how records are populated in the work list, go to [View my records by using the work list](prioritize-sales-pipeline-through-work-list.md#view-my-records-through-work-list).

5. To publish the changes, select **Publish**.

After the settings are published, you can open the seller's interface for the sales accelerator by selecting **Go to seller experience** under **Sales accelerator** on the **Get started with digital sales** page.

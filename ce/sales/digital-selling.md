## Overview

Dynamics 365 digital selling capabilities spearhead the digital transformation of sales organizations and constitute the data and productivity first revolution. You can enhance your digital selling programs with Sales Premium features such as Sales accelerator, conversation intelligence, and predictive scoring that are available with the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license. The premium features are available with a limited capacity. If you would like to avail all the benefits of premium features, you can purchase a license for Dynamics 365 Sales Premium.

To use digital selling capabilities, you must have Sales Hub app installed. If you don't have the Sales Hub app, you can install it by following the steps mentioned at: [Install the Sales solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/sales/set-up-dynamics-365-sales#install-the-sales-solution). Once the Sales Hub app is installed, digital selling capabilities can be set up from the **Get started with digital sales** page under **App Settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a Dynamics 365 Sales Premium license, you can still use this page to quickly set up the features. The only difference would be that there will be no monthly capacity limit.

    - Lead and opportunity scoring

## Sales accelerator

Sales accelerator in Dynamics 365 provides a tailored experience for sellers by minimizing the time they spend on their search for the best next customer to reach out to. It gathers information from multiple sources and lets sellers focus on how to best approach their customers. It helps sellers to sell smartly, by building a strong and prioritized pipeline, offering context, and surfacing automated recommendations throughout a sales sequence that helps to speed the sales process. More information: [What is the Sales accelerator?](sales-accelerator-intro.md)

When you setup sales accelerator with the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license, you get only 1500 sequence-connected records per month. If you require more capacity, you must purchase a license for Dynamics 365 Sales Premium.

### Quickly set up sales accelerator

1. On the **Get started with digital sales** page, under **Sales accelerator**, select **Quick setup**.

    The **Sales accelerator quick setup** panel is displayed.

2. In the **Enable for** section, choose one of the following options to grant permissions to use sales accelerator features.

    - **All security roles**: Select this option to give access to view the Sales Hub app to all the security roles in your organization.
    - **Specific security roles**: Select this option to specify security roles to give access to view the Sales Hub app to just a few users. Use the lookup box to add the security roles.

3. To add sample data for exploring the feature, select **Add sample data**. Installing the sample data is relevant only for your sandbox or trial environments. Adding the sample data might take a few minutes. However, you can choose to ignore the sample data installation and add it later when required.

4. In the **Content and layout** section, select the record types and their corresponding related forms that are used in your organization, as required.
    1. To add more records, select **Add record type**, and then select a record from the drop down list.
    2. Select a form for the selected record.

5. To publish the changes, select **Publish**.

Once the settings are published, you can open the seller's interface for sales accelerator by selecting **Go to seller experience** under **Sales accelerator** on the **Get started with digital sales** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to make advanced configurations for sales accelerator, select **Go to advanced sales accelerator settings** at the top of the quick setup panel. For information on advanced configurations, see [Configure the sales accelerator for Sales Premium](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md)

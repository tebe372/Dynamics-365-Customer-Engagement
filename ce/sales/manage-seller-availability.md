# Manage seller availability

As a sales manager, you can manage the availability of your sales team according to the needs of your business. By doing so, you can create a more flexible and accommodating work environment, allowing your team to take time off or switch shifts as needed. This can result in a more productive sales team, which in turn can improve customer satisfaction and increase sales.

## How can I manage sellers availability?

You can manage sellers availability in the following ways:

- **Advance settings**: Update the sellers' work hours through the advanced settings. 
 
    1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **System** > **Security** > **Users**.  

    1. Open the user record you want to set work hours for. 

    1. On the top, select the arrow next to the user name and then select **Work Hours**.

    1. On the **Monthly View** tab, select **Set Up** > **Time Off**.

    1. On the **Schedule Time Off** dialog box, enter the information for the time off, and then select **OK**. 
    
    The time off for the selected user is added to the calendar.

- **Calendar API**: Use the calendar API and enter the value of the ```EntityLogicalName``` string as ```msdyn_extendedusersetting```. More information: [Edit work hour calendars by using APIs](/dynamics365/field-service/field-service-work-hours-calendar-api). 
 
- **Assignment rules**: In Assignment rules, create a seller attribute based on seller availability and then apply appropriate values to the sellers based on their availability. For example, create an attribute with the values **Available** and **On vacation**. When a seller goes on vacation, you can select the attribute and assign the **On vacation** value to notify that the seller isn't available.

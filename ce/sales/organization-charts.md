# Organization charts (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Organization charts help sellers to gain insights into their customers' organizational structure and identify key decision-makers. With this knowledge, sellers can develop sales strategies, improve their sales effectiveness, and build stronger relationships with their customers.

By visualizing the hierarchy and relationships between different departments and roles within the customer's organization, sellers can better understand the decision-making process and identify the individuals who hold the most influence over purchasing decisions. This information allows sellers to tailor their sales approach to the customer's specific needs and preferences, resulting in better outcomes for both the seller and the customer.

With Dynamics 365 Sales, you can build an entire organization chart with ease and precision by simple drag-and-drop actions. The org chart also provides easy access to an embedded LinkedIn Sales Navigator widget, helping to ensure that contacts are kept up to date.

The enhanced org charts are supported for accounts and contacts.

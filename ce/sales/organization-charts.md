# Understand organization charts (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Organization charts help you visualize the hierarchy and relationships between departments and roles in your customers' organizations. You can better understand the decision-making process and identify the individuals who hold the most influence over purchasing decisions. With this information, you can tailor your sales approach to your customer's specific needs and preferences, resulting in better outcomes for both you and your customer.

With Dynamics 365 Sales, you can build an organization chart with ease and precision with simple drag-and-drop actions. The org chart also provides easy access to an embedded LinkedIn Sales Navigator widget that helps to keep contacts up to date.

Org charts are available for accounts and contacts.

## How can I use org charts?

- If you have a System Administrator or similar role, you can [turn on the org chart feature](enable-org-chart.md) for sales managers and sellers in your organization.

- If you have a Sales Manager, Salesperson, or similar role, you can [manage org charts](manage-org-charts.md) and [view org charts](view-understand-org-charts.md).

## Permissions required

> - To prevent unwanted results, sample data is available only in non-production environments.  
> - You can also add sample data from the quick setup panel (with the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license). More information: [Set up sales accelerator](/dynamics365/sales/digital-selling#set-up-sales-accelerator)

# Work assignment

Work assignment helps in creating [segments](#what-are-segments) to group records and prioritize them as per your sales strategy. Further, you can create a set of rules ([assignment rules](#what-are-assignment-rules)) to automatically assign records to sellers and connect records to sequences to guide sellers with their next steps. 

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or [Microsoft Relationship Sales](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-in/sales/relationship-sales/) <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator, Sequence Manager, or Sales Manager <br>  More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

## Review prerequisites  

Before you start, be sure that the sales accelerator is configured in your organization. More information: [Configure the sales accelerator](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md)

## what are segments?

Segments helps you to categorize records based on specific criteria such as location, deal value, language, and product. By using segments, you can automatically connect records to sequences and create assignment rules to automatically assign sellers to records. You can create segments for all entities, including custom entities.

You can use the segment builder to:

- [Create and activate segments](wa-create-and-activate-a-segment.md).
- [Manage assignment rules](#what-are-assignment-rules).
- [Connect a segment to a sequence](wa-connect-a-segment-to-sequence.md).
- [View and edit properties of a segment](wa-view-details-segment.md).
- [Edit a segment](wa-edit-a-segment.md)
- [Prioritize segment](prioritize-segment.md).
- [Delete or deactivate a segment](wa-delete-deactivate-a-segment.md).

## What are assignment rules?

Assignment rules enable new leads, opportunities, and suggestions to be automatically assigned to sellers or sales teams. This helps reduce the amount of time and effort required to manually assign records, prevent the loss of unassigned records, and balance assignments among sellers.

Assignment rules are supported for lead, opportunity, and suggestions record types.

You can create rules that match attributes (such as location and language) with seller or team attributes (such as location and language). For example, when a lead is created and satisfies the conditions of a specific rule, the lead is automatically assigned to a seller.

You can use the assignment rules designer to do the following tasks:

- [Create and activate assignment rules](wa-create-and-activate-assignment-rule.md).
- [Edit an assignment rule](wa-edit-assignment-rule.md).
- [Change priority of an assignment rule](wa-change-priority-assignment-rule.md).
- [Delete or deactivate an assignment rule](wa-delete-deactivate-assignment-rule.md).

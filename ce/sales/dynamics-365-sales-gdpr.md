# Dynamics 365 Sales and GDPR 

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is a European Union (EU) directive that is fundamentally about protecting and enabling the privacy rights of individuals. The GDPR establishes strict privacy requirements governing how you manage and protect personal data while respecting individual choice—no matter where data is sent, processed, or stored.

Here are some resources where you can learn more about how to bring your [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] systems into compliance with the GDPR:

- [Microsoft Dynamics 365 and GDPR](/dynamics365/get-started/gdpr/index). This webpage includes links to resources, white papers, blogs, and other information related to various [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] applications and the GDPR.
- [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter). This webpage includes links to information about how new features in Microsoft help you secure personal data and meet strict GDPR privacy requirements.
 
To comply with GDPR, we've made it possible to edit read-only records in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)].

The following table shows the states in which the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] records become read-only. 

|  Entity  |  State  |
|  ------  |  -----  |
|  Quote   | Active/Closed |
|  Order   | Fulfilled/Canceled/Submitted/Invoiced |
|  Invoice | Paid/Canceled/Closed | 

A system administrator can export read-only quote, order, and invoice records, update them, and import the updated records back to [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)].  

It is also possible to update the read-only records programmatically with the SDK for Dynamics 365 Sales.

## Update read-only records through export or import

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only an administrator or an impersonating user with administrative privileges can perform this action. Other users will get the following error message if they try to import records:
```Business Process Error: Cannot perform the action because the record is read only```

1. In your sales app, go to the list of records. For example, go to **Sales** > **Quotes**.

2. Open the view that shows all the records regardless of their state. For example, open the **All Quotes** view.

3. Select the records that you want to export, and on the command bar, select **Export to Excel** > **Static Worksheet**. More information: [Export data to Excel](/powerapps/user/export-data-excel)

4. In the file that you exported, make the necessary changes.

5. To import the updated records back into [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], in your sales app, in the list of records, select **Import Data**. More information: [Import data into Dynamics 365 Sales](import-data.md)


## Important points

- As a system administrator, you can edit any read-only field but changes will not reflect for the locked fields. 

- Non-admin users can't edit an active quote. However, an admin user can edit and save an active quote, although it is read-only for non-admin users.

- If configured, Plugins, Business processes and workflows will run on fields getting updated or becoming editable. 

- In case of Dynamics 365 Sales integration with any third-party system, there is a chance of GDPR requested changes to be overwritten if correct sequence of updates is not followed. It is the responsibility of the system administrator of Dynamics 365 Sales to follow the correct order.

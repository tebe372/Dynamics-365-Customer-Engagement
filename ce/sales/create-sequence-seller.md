Create sequences to automate your work and personalize communication while reaching out to prospects.

## What is a sequence?

Sequences enforce best practices by introducing a set of consecutive activities for you to follow during the course of your day. You can create and connect sequences to records such as, leads, opportunities, and accounts, that appear in your work queue, to help prioritize activities to focus on selling, be more productive, and better align to business processes.     
When you create a sequence, you define a set of activities that you want to perform&mdash;and the order to perform them in&mdash;as they handle records. This lets you concentrate on selling and gives you a better understanding of what to do next.   

## Permissions required to create and connect sequences

- When Sales accelerator workspace is not enabled in your organization, you can create and connect sequences through the **Salesperson** role. Also, delete and edit the sequences that you have created.

- When Sales accelerator workspace is enabled in your organization and the access is restricted to specific security roles, then only the users with that specific roles can create and connect the sequences. To get access to create and connect sequences, contact your administrator to provide permissions for your security role. More information: [Manage access and record type](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md#manage-access-and-record-type).   

>[!NOTE]
>If you have the the Sequence Manager role and to create sequences, go to [Create and activate a sequence](create-and-activate-a-sequence.md).

## How to create sequences?

Create sequences using the sequence designer. To access the sequence designer, use the following ways:

- [Personal settings](#personal-settings)
- [Up next widget](#up-next-widget)
- [Record grid view](#record-grid-view)

### Personal settings

Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **Personal settings**.    
       
On the **Personal settings** page, under **Sales accelerator** > **Sequence** and select **+ New sequence**.    

:::image type="content" source="media/sequence-seller-select-new-sequence-sequences-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sequences page to select new sequence.":::
        
The **Create a sequence** dialog opens. To continue creating the sequence, go to [Create sequence](#create-sequence).
    
Personal settings are the recommended way to access the sequence designer. Here, you can create, edit, delete and connect sequences.   

### Up next widget

The **Up next** widget is available on the out-of-the-box contact, opportunity, lead, and account forms. When you open a record, by default, the main form displays the **Up next** widget. For example, whe you open a lead record, the **Lead** form displays the **Up next** widget. 
        
:::image type="content" source="media/sequence-seller-connect-sequence-upnext-widget.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the up next widget to connect sequence.":::

When a sequence is not connected to a record, the **Up next** widget displays a message to connect the sequence. 
Select **Connect *record type* to a sequence** and the **Connect *record type* to sequence** dialog opens. In this example, we opened the connect sequence dialog for leads which has no sequences.

>[!NOTE]
>If sequences are available for the record type, the list is displayed. To create a sequence, select **Create new sequence**. 

Select **Create a new sequence** and the **Create a sequence** dialog opens in a new tab. To continue creating the sequence, go to [Create sequence](#create-sequence)

### Record grid view

While connecting a record to a sequence, you can create a new sequence, if there are no sequences available for the record type or the existing list doesn't meet your requirements.

Open the record type such as, lead, contact, or opportunity in the grid view for which you want to create the sequence. Select a record and then select **Connect sequence**. In this example, we opened the **Accounts** grid view and connecting a sequence.

The **Connect account to sequence** dialog opens. 

>[!NOTE]
>If sequences are available for the record type, the list is displayed. To create a sequence, select **Create new sequence**. 

Select **Create a new sequence** and the **Create a sequence** dialog opens in a new tab. To continue creating the sequence, go to [Create sequence](#create-sequence)

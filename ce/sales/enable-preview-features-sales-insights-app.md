# Enable coming soon features 

Sometimes **Coming soon** features that change the look, feel, or functionality of the application are added to conversation intelligence before the formal release.

As an administrator, activating **Coming soon** mode gives users in your organization early access to these new features, allowing them to share feedback with us before the changes are formally released. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you’ve already enabled **Coming soon** mode during your first-run setup, you’re not required to enable it again; however, you can disable **Coming soon** mode in your organization if you don’t wish to experience the new features that are yet to be released.

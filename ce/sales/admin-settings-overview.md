# [Sales Professional](#tab/SP)

Select **Sales Settings** from the site map to manage the admin settings in Sales Professional.

### Get started page

The **Get started** page provides an intuitive experience for setting up what's most important with a fewer clicks. With just one click, Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint are automatically configured for you, and your users are ready to send out emails or share documents. The quick setup also lets you quickly import data, so your users have it ready in the app to start their work. These settings can also be accessed from the **Standard settings** section.

> To learn how to use the site map to go to different areas of the app, see [Site map on the side](user-guide-learn-basics.md).

### Standard settings

The settings under **Standard settings** are the most commonly used settings in the app. You can find the settings for email, SharePoint, data import, and user management. The configurations are simple—you’ll be done with these in just a few clicks.

### Advanced settings

Use the **Advanced settings** section to configure the app, or to customize it to meet your organization’s requirements. You can find the settings for branding and theming, teams, and maintaining templates and more.

### Customization

If the Sales app does not entirely fit your business requirement, use the drag-and-drop designers to quickly make changes that reflect the specific information that your company needs. For example, change the pipeline phases to match your organization’s business flows, or add new fields to capture data relevant to your business—all of this without writing a single line of code.

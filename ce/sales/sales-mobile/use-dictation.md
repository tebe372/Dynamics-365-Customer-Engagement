# Use dictation in the mobile app

The Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app allows you to dictate text in a [compliant and secure way](/legal/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-to-text/data-privacy-security) by using the microphone icon in the app. You can use dictation for the following:

- Taking notes
- Entering details in a field that supports multiple lines of text, for example **Description**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The dictation capability in the mobile app uses the Microsoft Speech service. More information: [Speech service](/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/)
> - If you use the microphone icon on your phone's keyboard for dictation, it uses the built-in dictation capabilities of the phone's operating system.

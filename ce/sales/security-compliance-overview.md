# Security and compliance in Dynamics 365 Sales

Dynamics 365 Sales provides security and compliance features that help you protect your data and meet your organization's compliance requirements. This article provides an overview of these features.

## Compliance with GDPR

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is a European Union (EU) directive that is fundamentally about protecting and enabling the privacy rights of individuals. The GDPR establishes strict privacy requirements governing how you manage and protect personal data while respecting individual choiceâ€”no matter where data is sent, processed, or stored.

Here are some resources where you can learn more about how to bring your [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-365.md)] systems into compliance with the GDPR:

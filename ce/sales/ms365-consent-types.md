# Microsoft 365 consent types

Your Microsoft 365 admin needs to provide consent to let Dynamics 365 collect, store, and use Microsoft 365 data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 each have their own service-specific licensing terms. The service-specific terms that apply depend on which service processes your data. For example, when a copy of your Microsoft 365 data is transferred to Dynamics 365, your Microsoft 365 data in that copy becomes Dynamics 365 data and the Dynamics 365 service-specific terms apply.

**More information:**

- [Provide consent to collect data from Exchange Online](provide-consent-office365.md)

The following table shows an incomplete list of Dynamics 365 applications that use the shared data. This list is subject to change.

## Frequently asked questions

**Are custom fields on forms available offline?**

Yes, custom fields of all types are available to use offline. For lookup fields, only downloaded records can be referenced.

## Known issues

-	**Business process flows**: Business process flows aren't supported for mobile offline. When you're offline, business process flows grids and views won't be available to be rendered on records that are opened in offline mode. If a record containing a business process flow was loaded prior to going offline, business process flow functions&mdash;such as move next or move previous&mdash;won't work. Business process flows support the ability to branch to a different set of stages, based on conditions defined on fields of the record. In offline mode, the conditions that determine the next set of stages in the business process flows won't be evaluated.

-	**Qualify a lead**: After you've created and qualified a lead in mobile offline, when you go back online the business process stage will still be shown as the qualify stage. You'll have to manually select **Next stage** to move the lead to next stage.

-	**Views**: Views aren't supported for the following entities in offline mode:
    -	Email
    -	Task
    -	Appointment
    -	Phonecall
    
    Any views that have linked entities (related entity) that aren't available offline are also not supported.

-	Adding stakeholders, competitors, and sales teams to opportunities isn't supported in offline mode.

-	Product suggestions (when you're adding product lines to opportunities, quotes, orders, or invoices) aren't supported in offline mode.

-   Product property&ndash;related entities (DynamicProperty, DynamicPropertyInstance, DynamicPropertyOptionSetItem, and ProductSubstitute) aren't enabled for offline out of the box. These entities must be enabled for offline and added to an offline profile if you want to use product properties in offline mode.

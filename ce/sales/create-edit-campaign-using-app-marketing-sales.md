# Create or edit a campaign using in-app marketing

Promote your business, expand your reach to new customers, and improve sales by using campaigns in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)]. Use campaigns to store all your marketing information and activities, and to measure the success of your efforts. Campaigns contain planning tasks and campaign activities you need to manage for the marketing campaigns.  
  
 Add strategic campaign information to your campaign, such as:  
  
- Budgets and expenses  
  
- Promotion codes  
  
- Target products  
  
- Marketing collateral, including sales literature  
  
- Target marketing lists  
  
Campaigns can include planning activities that you want to perform before you launch the campaign, and also the campaign activities you want to manage as part of the campaign.

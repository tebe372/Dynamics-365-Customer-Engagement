# Install Dynamics 365 Sales apps

Depending on your subscription, you can install the Sales Hub or Sales Professional app to get started with Dynamics 365 Sales immediately. If you've bought the team member licenses, install the Team member app.  

## System requirements

## Install the Sales Hub app

Sales Hub is a free app from Microsoft that's preinstalled. If your organization has a Sales Enterprise or Sales Premium license, you are entitled to use the Sales Hub app directly. [Learn more](intro-saleshub.md)

## Install the Sales Professional app

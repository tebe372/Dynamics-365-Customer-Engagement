    Sales usage reports consist of the following dashboards:

    -	Opportunity usage reports
    -	Lead usage reports

## Understand the reports

The sales usage reports give you a broader overview of the performance of sales teams regarding leads and opportunities in your organization. The reports include KPIs and charts that show how leads and opportunities have performed over a period. 

The lead and opportunity dashboards can be categorized into the following sections:

-	[Data filters](#data-filters)
-	[KPI summary charts](#kpi-summary-charts)
-	[Metric charts](#metric-charts)

### Data filters

Use the data filtering options to select data for a specific time period, seller, sales manager, business unit, and role. By default, all data filters are selected and the date range covers the last 20 weeks.

### KPI summary charts

The KPI summary charts summarize KPIs for the specified date and the percent change during the period. You can further filter these areas by seller, sales manager, business unit, and role. Also, a trend is displayed corresponding to the value specifying how the KPI is doing in the selected timeframe when compared with the previous timeframe. A green upward triangle indicates an improvement in the score, and a red downward triangle indicates a decline in the score.

The following table shows the KPIs that are displayed in the report (in this example, an opportunity usage report).<!--note from editor: Suggested, to avoid saying "we are".-->

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Opportunities converted | The number of opportunities that were converted into won deals.<!--note from editor: It looks like the UI uses "won deals" (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/sales/relationship-analytics), which also works better grammatically.--> |
| Opportunity conversion rate | The percentage of opportunities that were successfully converted into won deals. |
| Avg. time (in days) for opportunity conversion | The average number of days that it took for an opportunity to be converted into a won deal. |

### Metric charts

The metric charts provide a detailed view into the individual values of records, such as created date, status, and who created and converted them.

To view specific data that's related to a value in the charts, select the value. Other metric charts in the report will be refreshed to show data that's related to the value you select. Drilling down into these values helps you to identify the areas of improvement.

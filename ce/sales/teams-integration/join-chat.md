# Join an existing linked chat

As a seller, you can view and easily join chats that are linked to a record you have write access to, even if you werenâ€™t originally a participant in the chat. For example, if you've onboarded to a lead that was previously handled by another seller, you can join the chat to better understand the context, and then continue to collaborate with your relevant colleagues.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only join linked chats. To do so, you must have write access to the record and your admin must turn on the Join Chat capability for the record type in which you want to join any existing linked chat.

**To join a linked chat**:

1. Open the record for which you want to join the chat.

2. In the **Teams chats (Preview)** pane, go to any of the linked chats you want to join. A lock icon is displayed with text that says, "Hover over to join this chat". When you hover over the lock icon, if you have write access to the associated record, a **Join** button will be displayed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Let's assume you have only Read access to the set of Accounts which your team is working on. Your administrator has enabled the Join chat functionality for the Accounts record type.
    >
    > If you don't see the text that allows you to hover and join a chat, there are three possible causes:<br> - Your administrator hasn't enabled the Join chat capability for the record type.<br> - You have read-only access to the record.<br> - Both previous scenarios apply.
    >     
    > In these cases, you will still see a list of conversations with the message "The chat is locked". In this case, you can ask a member of the chat to manually add you, or you can ask your administrator to turn on the Join chat capabilities for that record type. 

3. Select **Join**.

    The Teams pop-up chat will show that you've been added to the chat, and you'll have access to the entire chat history. Other chat members will also receive the system message that you've been added to the chat.

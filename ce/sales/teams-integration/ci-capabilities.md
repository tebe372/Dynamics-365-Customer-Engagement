[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]


The following prerequisites must be met before you can use conversation intelligence in a Teams meeting:

- Conversation intelligence must be enabled by the administrator. There would be a monthly capacity limit on the usage of conversation intelligence according to your Dynamics 365 Sales license.
- The record must be linked to the meeting.
- The Dynamics 365 app must be added to the meeting.

Conversation intelligence adds the following capabilities to your Teams meetings:

- Select a transcribed language and start recording
- View a real-time transcript of the call, including highlighted keywords and insights
- Mentioned action items are automatically detected and displayed as suggestions in real-time
- Add suggested action items to the notepad with one click
- After the meeting, get a rich conversation analysis that includes sentiment analysis, key performance indicators, and action items operations

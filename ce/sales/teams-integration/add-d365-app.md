# Add the Dynamics 365 app to a Microsoft Teams meeting (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]


When you add the Dynamics 365 app to a Teams meeting, you can view record details before, during, and after a meeting. The Dynamics 365 app can be added to a Teams meeting automatically or manually.

> [!NOTE]
> The Dynamics 365 app for Teams is available only in Teams desktop app. If you are working in Teams web client, you'll not be able to add the Dynamics 365 app to a meeting.

## Automatically add the app

If you link a Dynamics 365 record to a meeting while you're creating it in Dynamics 365 or Outlook, the Dynamics 365 app is added to the meeting automatically. This allows you to view record details before, during, and after a meeting.

## Manually add the app

If you don't link a Dynamics 365 record to a meeting while you're creating it, you can add the app to the meeting manually. We recommend you add it before you join the meeting for a better experience.

To add an app before a meeting, first send the meeting invitation, and then edit the meeting in Teams. Select **Add a tab**, search for the Dynamics 365 app, and add it.

To add an app during a meeting, select **Add an app** in the meeting toolbar, search for the Dynamics 365 app, and add it.

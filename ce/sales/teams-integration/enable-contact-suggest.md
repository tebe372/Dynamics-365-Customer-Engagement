## Turn on the suggested contacts capability for a record type

As an administrator, you can enable the suggested contacts to be displayed when a seller starts a new connected chat. It helps the sellers to quickly find the right coworkers to collaborate with.

> [!NOTE]
> For the case record type, there are two types of contact suggestions: AI and rules-based. Other record types enabled for connected chats may only have rules-based suggestions.

1. In the Sales Hub app, select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area](media/change-area-icon.png) in the lower-left corner, and then select **App Settings**.

2. Under **General Settings**, select **Chat and collaborate**.

3. Under **Connect chats to Dynamics 365 records**, select the record type (for example, Lead).

4. In the settings panel, turn on the **Rules-based suggested contacts** toggle.

5. In the **Update rules for suggesting contacts** section, reorder or disable the rules for suggesting contacts. Users will see the suggestions in the order you choose.

    - To reorder the rules, hover over a rule, and then select the up or down arrow to move the rules up or down respectively.
    - To disable a rule, hover over a rule, and then select :::image type="icon" source="media/suggested-contacts-rule-disable.png" border="false":::. When the rule is disabled, :::image type="icon" source="media/suggested-contacts-rule-disabled.png" border="false"::: is displayed when you hover over the disabled rule.

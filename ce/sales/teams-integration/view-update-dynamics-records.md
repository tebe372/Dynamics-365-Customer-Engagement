# View and update record details (production-ready preview)

After you receive a card in a Teams chat, you can view its details and update them as required.

1.  In a record card whose details you want to update, select one of the following:

    - **View details**: The record is opened in a new window inside Teams.
    
        ![Interactive card within Teams](media/me-view-details-teams.png "Interactive card within Teams")

    -  **Open in Dynamics 365**: The record is opened in the customer engagement app.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The recipients can view and update the record if they have the necessary permissions in Dynamics 365. Otherwise, they'll see a permission error.

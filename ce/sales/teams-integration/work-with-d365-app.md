# Work with the Dynamics 365 app (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]


With the Dynamics 365 app, you can view information about a linked record before the meeting, in the side panel during the meeting, and after the meeting.

## View record details before or after a meeting

Open the meeting in Teams, and then select the **Dynamics 365** tab. You can work with the linked record as you would in your customer engagement apps, such as Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

## View record details during a meeting

Select the Dynamics 365 app icon in the meeting toolbar. Details about the linked record are displayed in a side panel. You can view and update information such as notes and tasks in the Contact, Opportunity, Lead, Account, and Case tables.

# Share a forecast

You can share a forecast with anyone in your hierarchy or outside of your hierarchy and specify the access level (such as read or read and adjust rollup) that you want to give the user. For example, Henry, the Sales Manager wants one of his direct reports, Serena Davis, to manage the forecasts while he's on vacation. He can share his forecast hierarchy with Serena and assign the appropriate permissions.

1.  Go to **Performance &gt; Forecasts** in the Sales Hub sitemap.

    You'll see the **Share** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/share-icon.png" border="false"::: next to the forecasts that are enabled for sharing. If you don't see the **Share** icon, contact your administrator to enable forecast sharing.

2.  Select the **Share** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/share-icon.png" border="false"::: next to a specific forecast record or hierarchy. 

3.  In the **Sharing** dialog, specify the users with whom you want to share the forecast and select the pencil icon to specify the access level.

    **Note:** You can specify different level of access for each user if your administrator has set the **Read and adjust** option.

    The selected forecast record or hierarchy is shared with the specified users.

## Stop sharing a forecast

To stop sharing a forecast with a user, select the **Share** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/share-icon.png" border="false"::: next to the forecast record. In the **Sharing** dialog, find the user you want to stop sharing with, and then select the **Delete** icon next to the username. 

To stop sharing the entire forecast hierarchy from all the users, your administrator needs to disable the sharing option for the forecast. For more information, see [Enable or disable forecast sharing](provide-permissions-forecast.md#enable-or-disable-forecast-sharing).

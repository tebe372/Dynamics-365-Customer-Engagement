## Import contacts, accounts, and leads  

Get your customer records into [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], and add these to marketing lists so you can target your campaigns. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Import data](/power-platform/admin/import-data-all-record-types)  
  
## Create marketing lists  

You can group accounts, contacts, or leads into a targeted marketing list. You can create a marketing list easily with the search functionality in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], so you find all of your customers in a particular area, for example, and add them to the member list.

## Understand the difference between a campaign and a quick campaign  

In the marketing area, use standard campaigns to manage the end-to-end process of a complete marketing campaign, like managing campaign and planning activities, distributing the activities to other team members, and tracking how the campaign did. Campaigns include extensive tracking features, including detailed information, reports, and multiple marketing lists.  
  
 In contrast to standard campaigns, use quick campaigns to automatically distribute a single activity to selected accounts, contacts, or leads, or to a single marketing list. The effects of a quick campaign are immediate.

## Create a campaign or a quick campaign  
 Depending on your requirement, track your marketing activities through a campaign or a quick campaign. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create or edit a campaign using in-app marketing](create-edit-campaign-using-app-marketing-sales.md), [Create a quick campaign using in-app marketing](create-quick-campaign-using-app-marketing-sales.md)  
  
## Track a campaign response  
 Record the replies you get from the potential customers in response to a specific marketing campaign to make sure your team can act on the responses. Measure the success of specific campaign activities based on their response rates. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Track a marketing campaign response using in-app marketing](track-marketing-campaign-response-using-app-marketing-sales.md)  
  
## See how your campaigns are doing with default marketing reports  
 Use one of the following reports to assist you in monitoring and analyzing marketing activities:  
  
- **Campaign Activity Status**: Use this report to track a campaign. The report displays a summary for one campaign.  
  
- **Campaign Comparison**: Use this report to identify your most and least successful campaigns.  
  
- **Campaign Performance**: Use this report to track the progress and status of your campaigns.  
  
## Let your customers unsubscribe from marketing communications  
 You can enable customers to unsubscribe from email marketing communications your organization sends them.  
  
 More information: [System Settings dialog box - Marketing tab](/power-platform/admin/system-settings-dialog-box-marketing-tab)  
  
 Note that you cannot add unsubscribe functionality to direct email or email templates.

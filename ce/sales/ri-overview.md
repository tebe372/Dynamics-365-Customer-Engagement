# Overview of Relationship intelligence 

Your organization's sales teams can use the relationship analytics in Dynamics 365 Sales to monitor the health and risks of their customer relationships. Graphical representations of KPIs and activity histories are available for any contact, opportunity, lead, or account. Detailed analytics about customer interactions, patterns, and trends are based on interaction data from Dynamics 365 and Office. With more accurate and complete relationship information, sales teams can more effectively identify customers who need their attention.

Relationship analytics appears on Sales Insights opportunity record forms. Relationship health appears on opportunity record forms, list views, and charts. For more information how the relationship analytics and health scores appear for sellers, see [Use relationship analytics to gather KPIs](relationship-analytics.md).

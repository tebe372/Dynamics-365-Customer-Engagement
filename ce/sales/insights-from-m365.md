# Insights generated from Microsoft 365 data

Dynamics 365 Sales generates the following relationship insights using Microsoft 365 data:

- [Relationship analytics and health](#relationship-analytics-and-health)
- [Who knows whom](#who-knows-whom)

## Relationship analytics and health

Relationship analytics provides a comprehensive view of KPIs and activity histories for any contact, opportunity, lead, or account. It also calculates the overall health and trend of your business relationships based on your interactions with your customers through emails and activities in Dynamics 365. With these insights, you can identify critical opportunities and customer relationships that need your attention.

The following screenshot is an example of how relationship analytics data appears for open opportunities:

For more information on how to set up and use this feature, go to [Configure relationship analytics and health](configure-relationship-analytics.md) and [Use relationship analytics to gather KPIs](relationship-analytics.md).

## Who knows whom

Who knows whom helps you identify colleagues who can introduce you to a lead or contact based on their email interactions with the lead. An introduction can increase the chances of a positive outcome. This feature provides you with details such as the names and email addresses of your colleagues and the strength of their connection to the lead.

The following screenshot is an example of the **Who Knows Whom** widget on a lead page:

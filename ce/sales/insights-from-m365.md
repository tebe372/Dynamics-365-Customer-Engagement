# Insights generated from Microsoft 365 data

Dynamics 365 Sales generates the following relationship insights using Microsoft 365 data:
 
- [Relationship analytics and health](#relationship-analytics-and-health)
- [Who knows whom ](#who-knows-whom)


## Relationship analytics and health

Relationship analytics provides a comprehensive view of KPIs and activity histories for any contact, opportunity, lead, or account. The feature also calculates the overall health and trend of each of your business relationships based on your interactions with your customers through emails and activities in Dynamics 365. With these insights, you can identify critical opportunities and customer relationships that need your attention. 

The following screenshot is an example of how relationship analytics data appears for an opportunity:

For more information on how to use this feature, see [Use relationship analytics to gather KPIs](relationship-analytics.md) and how to configure the feature, see [Configure relationship analytics and health](configure-relationship-analytics.md).

## Who knows whom

Who knows whom helps you identify colleagues who can introduce you to a lead or contact based on their email interactions with the lead. Such introduction can increase the chances of a positive outcome during the interaction. This feature provides you with details such as names and email addresses of your colleagues who know the lead. 

The following screenshot is an example of the who knows whom widget on a lead page:

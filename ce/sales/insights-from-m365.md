# Insights generated from Microsoft 365 data

This article describes the insights generated by Dynamics 365 applications from Microsoft 365 data and the consent required for the same. Once the Microsoft 365 admin provides consent, a copy of your companyâ€™s Microsoft 365 data is placed in Dynamics 365 applications. Dynamics 365 can then use this copy to generate relevant insights and display them to authorized Dynamics 365 users.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dynamics 365 applications can't access data of users who have opted out. 
  
The following table provides more information about each type of consent and the insights available.

Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 have their own service-specific licensing terms. The service-specific terms that apply depend on which service processes your data. For example, when your Microsoft 365 data is copied to Dynamics 365, your Microsoft 365 data in that copy becomes Dynamics 365 data and the Dynamics 365 service-specific terms apply.

> When disabling these consents, it can take up to 24 hours for the data to be removed from all apps and up to 30 days for backed-up data to be removed from Microsoft 365 storage accounts.

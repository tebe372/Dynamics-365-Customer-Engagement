# View and manage unassigned records

Monitoring of unassigned records allows you to view the lead or opportunity records that aren't assigned to any seller. As an administrator, sales manager, or sequence manager, you can view these unassigned records and assign to sellers.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise  <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator, Sequence Manager, or Sales Manager <br>  More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

## View unassigned records

You can view the list of records that aren't assigned to sellers and assign them to sellers either manually or by creating an assignment rule. More information: [Create and activate an assignment rule](create-and-activate-assignment-rule.md#to-create-and-activate-an-assignment-rule).

The records aren't assigned automatically because of one of the following reasons:

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Eligible sellers don't have availability | Record couldn't be assigned as eligible sellers aren't available. |
| Eligible sellers don't have capacity | Record couldn't be assigned as eligible sellers don't have the capacity. |
| No assignment rule for this record's segment | Record doesn't match any assignment rule that is currently active and available in the organization.|
| No sellers meet the conditions | Record isn't assigned as none of the sellers meet the conditions that are defined in the matched assignment rule. |
| Owner assigned manually | Owner is manually assigned to the record. |
| Owner assigned successfully | Owner is assigned to the record. |
| Record doesn't meet any conditions | Record isn't assigned as it doesn't match any conditions that are defined for the assignment rule. |
| Run is in progress | Specifies that the assignment is in progress for the record. |
| There was an issue with the server | Record isn't assigned as there's an issue with the server that your organization is hosted on. |

You can view the unassigned records in one of the following ways:

- [Assignment rules homepage](#assignment-rule-homepage)
- [Monitor tab](#monitor-tab)

**Assignment rules homepage**<a name="assignment-rule-homepage"></a>

When you open the **Assignment rules** home page, by default the lists of rules are grouped according to the available segments. If not, select **Group by segment** > **Segments**. Grouping by segments helps you to view the number of records that aren't assigned to a seller. Further, you can run the rules again or schedule the run for that segment to assign these records. More information: [Run reassignment of unassigned records](#run-reassignment-of-unassigned-records) and [Schedule reassignment of unassigned records](#schedule-reassignment-of-unassigned-records)

1. Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.
1. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page, and select **Sales Insights settings**.
1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Assignment rules**.  

    The number of unassigned records that belong to a segment are displayed under the **Unassigned records** column under the **Rules** tab.

    >[!NOTE]
    >- If no segment is attached to a rule, then the rule is grouped under **No segments**.
    >- When a segment is deleted, the attached rules will be automatically assigned to the default segment.

By analyzing the reason, you can take appropriate action by assigning these leads to sellers, creating an assignment rule, or by adding conditions to existing assignment rule. More information: [Create and activate an assignment rule](create-and-activate-assignment-rule.md#to-create-and-activate-an-assignment-rule).

## Run reassignment of unassigned records

The number of unassigned records for a segment is displayed in the **Unassigned records** column in the **Assignment rules** page. Run the rules again in the segment and try to assign the records to the sellers. After the records are assigned, you can view the history of assigned records.

By default, a maximum of 500 records are considered for reassignment on each run. Older records are prioritized for assignment.

For example, you can schedule the reassignment of unassigned records to run every weekday at 6:00 AM and 2:00 PM.

Once the scheduled run is complete, the history is updated with the latest time. More information: [View reassignment run history](#view-reassignment-run-history)

# Grant access to who knows whom information

By default, the Salesperson and Sales Manager roles have the permissions to view the who knows whom information in the contact and lead pages. As an administrator, you can grant access to other roles if they too would benefit from the who knows whom information.  

> [!NOTE]
> The who knows whom widget will appear for all users who can view the Sales Insights view in the contact and lead pages. Users who don't have the permissions will see a message that they don't have sufficient privileges.  

**To grant access:**

1. In the Sales Hub app, select **Settings** in the upper-right corner and select **Advanced Settings**.
1. In the Business Management page, select **Settings**, **System**, **Security**.
1. Select **Security Roles**.
1. Select the security role that you want to grant access for.
1. In the **Custom Entities** tab, provide read permissions to the following entities:

   ```wkwcolleaguesforcompany```  
   ```wkwcolleaguesforcontact```  
   ```wkwconfig```

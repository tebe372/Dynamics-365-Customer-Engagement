## What is duplicate detection?

The duplicate detection capability helps sellers to check for potential duplicate leads in the app. When you enable this capability, the AI model uses the following rules to identify duplicates:

-	Same email address 
-	Same phone number
-	Similar lead name and company name 
-	Similar lead name and the same email domain   

Further, sellers can compare and remove the duplicate leads in the organization. More information: [Manage duplicate leads](manage-duplicate-leads.md)

# Sales Hub app versus custom app

Sales Hub is a Microsoft first-party app that's designed and configured for ideal seller experiences. The app is designed keeping in mind the sales processes followed by majority of the organizations, across domains. However, if your organization has unique selling processes, you can either customize the Sales Hub app or create a custom app from scratch. 

Use the following table to compare the Sales Hub app and custom app, and decide which one suits your needs better: 

| **Factors to consider**                                                      | **Sales Hub**                                                                                                                                | **Custom app**                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## When to create custom app and when to customize the Sales Hub app

Every sales implementation has unique aspects and considerations that will influence the application strategy.

**Create a custom app in the following cases**:

- You want an app for the non-traditional sales roles such as senior executives, who just need to see Power BI dashboards and a handful of entities, or an audit supervisor who only needs to see the won opportunities.
- Your organization has a completely customized sales process and the built-in sales module doesn't cater to your needs. 
- You've created many custom entities and you want to remove all or many of the built-in components. 
- You want to build an XRM solution that combines multiple work streams and is not focused on Sales Hub app or Customer Service app. You want to keep the application lean without many of the built-in first-party components.

**Customize the first-party apps (such as Sales Hub) in the following cases**:

- When your organization follows standard sales practices with the need for few customizations.
- When you want to combine specific components and processes from two or more first-party apps such as Sales Hub and Customer Service Hub, assess which application is primary for the persona it caters  to:

    - For a salesperson, who needs to access all the sales module components and the customer assets entity from customer service module, configure Sales Hub app to include the customer assets entity.

    - For a customer service manager, who needs to have access to the case management module and  the opportunities pipeline, configure the Customer Service Hub app to include the opportunity entity.

## How Sales Hub app updates handle customizations

To help ensure that the Sales Hub customizations are not overwritten by the Sales Hub app update, Microsoft adopts the following practices:

- Weekly updates that contain bug fixes and performance improvements are automatically pushed to the app. 

- Weekly updates can occasionally contain new features or UI disruptive updates. These updates are behind the admin toggle. Administrators can test whether the updates impact customization and then enable it in production when they're ready. 

- Quarterly releases that have new and innovative features have an early access period. Itâ€™s important for all customers to test and validate their applications and core use cases on the new build. 

- Updates pushed to the Sales Hub site map or other objects (forms, entities, views) do not overwrite the customizations that you've done to the site map, or the objects. Instead, the changes will be merged. More information:

## How to revert changes to Sales Hub app

Unfortunately, there's no option to revert changes to the Sales Hub app. You have to manually undo the changes.   

For example, let's say you've removed an entry (such as Cases) from the site map and you want to add it back. You've to manually add the entry back to the sitemap. More information: [Customize the app](manage-app#customize-the-app)

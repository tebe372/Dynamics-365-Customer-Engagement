# Sales Hub app versus custom app

Sales Hub is a Microsoft first-party app that's designed and configured for ideal seller experiences. The app is designed keeping in mind the sales processes followed by majority of the organizations, across domains. However, if your organization has unique selling processes, you can either customize the Sales Hub app or create a custom app from scratch. 

Use the following table to compare the Sales Hub app and custom app, and decide which one suits your needs better: 

| **Capabilities**                                                      | **Sales Hub**                                                                                                                                | **Custom app**                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Sales Hub customizations and app updates

To help ensure that the customizations are not overwritten by the Sales Hub app update, Microsoft adopts the following practices:

- Weekly updates that contain bug fixes and performance improvements are automatically pushed to the app.

- Weekly updates can occasionally contain new features or UI disruptive updates. These updates are behind the admin toggle. Administrators can test whether the updates impact customization and then enable it in production when they're ready. 

- Quarterly releases that have new and innovative features have an early access period. Itâ€™s important for all customers to test and validate their applications and core use cases on the new build. 

- Updates to the Sales Hub site map do not overwrite the customizations that you've done to the site map. Instead, the changes will be merged.

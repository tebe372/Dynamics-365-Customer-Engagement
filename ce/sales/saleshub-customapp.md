# Sales Hub app versus custom app

Sales Hub is a Microsoft first-party app that's designed and configured for ideal seller experiences. The app is designed keeping in mind the sales processes followed by majority of the organizations, across domains. However, if your organization has unique selling processes, you can either customize the Sales Hub app or create a custom app from scratch. 

Use the following table to compare the Sales Hub app and custom app, and decide which one suits your needs better: 


## Sales Hub customizations and app updates

To help ensure that the customizations are not overwritten by the Sales Hub app update, Microsoft adopts the following practices:

- Weekly updates that contain bug fixes and performance improvements are automatically pushed to the app.
- Weekly updates that can occasionally contain new features or UI disruptive updates. These updates are behind the admin toggle. Administrators can test whether the updates impact customization and then enable it in production when they're ready. 
- Quarterly releases have new and innovative features that allow customers to transform their business. Therefore, itâ€™s important for all customers to test and validate their applications and core use cases on the new build. With the hundreds of new features delivered with the release waves the platform evolves and grows, thus allowing customers to develop and differentiate their business from the competition.

Weekly updates from Microsoft overriding customer layering and customizations should be seen as exceptional. It is not the strategy nor the model.

## How to configure the dialer

As an administrator, you must configure Microsoft Teams dialer for sellers to use. Perform the following steps:

1.	[Review the prerequisites](#review-the-prerequisites).
2.	[Configure the dialer](#configure-the-dialer).

## Review the prerequisites

Review the following requirements before you configure Microsoft Teams dialer in your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app:     
-	You have a license for using Microsoft Teams. Any Microsoft Teams license will work. More information: [Microsoft Teams add-on licenses](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing?tabs=small-business).      
-	Your organization has a phone system installed, with a valid license to use it. More information: [Set up Phone System in your organization](/MicrosoftTeams/setting-up-your-phone-system).          

## Configure the dialer

1.	Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.          
2.	Go to **App settings**, and under **General settings**, select **Teams calls (preview)**.    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Microsoft Teams dialer configuration page.](media/teams-dialer-configuration-page.png "Microsoft Teams dialer configuration page")     
3.	In the **What you need to set up Microsoft Teams calls** section, the application validates that your organization has sufficient privileges to use **Phone system** and **Microsoft Teams**.
    - Upon successful validation, the status corresponding to **Phone system license** and **Teams license** displays **Status: Successfully set up**. Proceed to step 4.   
        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Phone system and Microsoft Teams licenses successful validation.](media/teams-dialer-systems-validation-successful.png "Phone system and Microsoft Teams licenses successful validation")      
    - <a name="tenant-admin-contact"></a> If any of the validations fails, you can't proceed with the configuration. Contact your tenant administrator to set up the phone system and Microsoft Teams for your organization.    
    When the tenant administrator completes the configuration of [phone system](/MicrosoftTeams/setting-up-your-phone-system) and [Teams licenses](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing?tabs=small-business), you can continue with the configuration. Select **Check status**.

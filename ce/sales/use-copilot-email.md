[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Copilot uses natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to help creating emails messages. Trained on vast text data, Copilot generates personalized, high-quality emails tailored to specific needs.

Dynamics 365 Sales uses Copilot capabilities to help sellers in creating emails that effectively engage customers, ensuring clarity, conciseness, and compelling content.

## How can I use the Copilot email assist feature?

-	**Sales manager, seller, or any other similar role**:  
    -	[Compose and send email messages using Copilot](compose-send-email-copilot.md)

## Region and language support

-	**Region**: The Copilot email assist is currently available in North America (NAM) and Europe (EUR).
-	**Language**: Currently, Copilot email assist supports only English. The email and custom text must be in English to generate the suggested content.

## How is suggested content generated?

Dynamics 365 Sales uses Copilot to generate suggested email content. Trained on a vast number of text samples from the Internet, Copilot generates new content that looks and sounds like it was written by a person.  

Original content is generated every time, but it isnâ€™t always factual. In addition, the underlying technology uses AI that has been trained on a wide range of internet sources. Some suggestions may include questionable or inappropriate content. It's your responsibility to edit generated suggestions so that your reply is accurate and appropriate.

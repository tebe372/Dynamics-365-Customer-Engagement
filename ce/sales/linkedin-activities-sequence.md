## How do LinkedIn activities help?

In sequences, activities that are based on LinkedIn Sales Navigator allow sellers to diversify their day-to-day activities by including the social selling functions that are available in LinkedIn. You can use LinkedIn's vast network with recommended actions that your sellers can take to build deeper connections.

As an administrator or sequence manager, you can add the following activities to sequences:   
-	[Research](#research-activity)
-	[Get introduced](#get-introduced-activity) 
-	[Connect](#connect-activity)
-	[Send InMail](#send-inmail)

## Prerequisites  

Ensure that you meet the following requirements before configuring LinkedIn activities:

- LinkedIn Sales Navigator is configured in your organization. More information: [Install and enable LinkedIn Sales Navigator](/dynamics365/linkedin/install-sales-navigator)
- The latest version of the solution is installed. Go to **Advanced settings** > **Solutions**, and search for **msdyn_LinkedInSalesNavigatorAnchor**. The version number should be **3.0.1.1060** or later. 
- You have the proper license to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator.

## Research activity

Sellers can use<!--note from editor: Here and throughout (and in the companion article), I suggest using "can" instead of "allows", to better follow the style guide.--> the **Research** activity to view a customer's LinkedIn profile, including contact and account information. This helps sellers to better understand customers before starting to work with them. More information: [Leads Module References](/linkedin/sales/display-services/leads-screenshots) and [Accounts Module References](/linkedin/sales/display-services/accounts-screenshots)

When the activity is displayed to the seller, the LinkedIn **Research** step is displayed in the **Up next** widget and work list. 

**To add the Research activity**

1. In the activity selection box, select the **LinkedIn** tab, and then select **Research**.  

2. In the **Research** box, enter a description for the activity, and then select **Save**.   

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Research activity selected.](media/sa-linkedin-activity-research-box.png "Research activity selected")        

 The **Research** step is created and added to the sequence.

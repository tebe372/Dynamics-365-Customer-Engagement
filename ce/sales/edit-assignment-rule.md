## To edit an assignment rule 

>[!NOTE]
>In this procedure, we are using lead as an example to edit an assignment rule. Similarly, you can use this procedure to edit opportunity assignment rule. 

1.	Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.    
2.	Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page, and select **Sales Insights settings**.   
3. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Assignment rules**.    

4.	On the **Assignment rules** page, from the **Rule** tab, select the rule and then select the pencil icon to edit.   

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select the edit rule option](media/sa-ar-select-edit-rule.png "Select the edit rule option")    

    The **Create assignment rule** pane opens.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Edit assignment rule pane](media/sa-ar-edit-rule-pane.png "Edit assignment rule pane")    

5.	Edit the information according to your needs, and then select **Update rule**.

The changes will be applied to new leads that are created in the future in the application. The leads that were already assigned through the rule won't change.

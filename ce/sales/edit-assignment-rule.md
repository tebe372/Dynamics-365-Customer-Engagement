# Edit assignment rules

To modify your process for automatically assigning leads or opportunities to sellers, you can update the conditions that you've defined in the rule.  

[!INCLUDE [sales-work-assignment](../includes/sales-work-assignment.md)]

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | [Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | [System Administrator or Sequence Manager](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

## Edit an assignment rule

1. Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.

1. In the lower-left corner of the page, select **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Work assignment**.

1. Select a **Record type**, and then select and open a segment of that type that has the assignment rule you want to edit.

1. Hover over the rule and select **More options** (**&vellip;**) > **View and edit**.

1. Change what you need to, and then select **Save**.

Your changes are applied to records that are connected to the segment going forward. Any records that were previously connected to the segment aren't affected.

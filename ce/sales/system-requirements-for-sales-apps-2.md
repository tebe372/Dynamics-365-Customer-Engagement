## System requirements for Sales Hub and Sales Professional apps 

Sales Hub and Sales Professional apps are free Dynamics 365 Sales apps from Microsoft. The Sales Hub app is preinstalled in your Dynamics 365 Sales environment and comes with several core and premium features to help you quickly get started with Dynamics 365 Sales. The Sales Professional app includes features and configurations that the Sales Professional customers are entitled to.  

This article lists the licensing and system requirements for these out-of-the-box sales apps.  

## Licensing  

- The Sales Hub app requires an active subscription to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Sales Enterprise license.  

- The Sales Professional app requires an active subscription to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Professional license.  

## Supported operating systems and browsers  

The Sales Hub and Sales Professional apps are model-driven apps built using Power Apps. For a list of supported operating systems and browsers for both web and mobile applications, see [Power Apps system requirements and limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/limits-and-config). 

## Network requirements  

The embedded Teams dialer in the Sales Hub app uses Azure Communication Services (ACS) and hence needs the same network requirements as ACS. For the exact requirements, see [Prepare your organization's network for Azure Communication Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/network-requirements). 

## Storage requirements  

Conversation intelligence requires Azure or Teams storage for storing call recordings.

## Supported regions and languages  

For a list of regions supported for product availability and data location, and a list of supported languages and localization, see [Dynamics 365 availability and data locations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/get-started/availability).

> [!NOTE]

# Delete or deactivate assignment rules

Sometimes, you might want to get rid of assignment rules that are no longer relevant or useful for your sales team. You have two options to do this in Dynamics 365 Sales Hub:

- **Deactivate an assignment rule.** This keeps the rule in the app, but stops it from assigning any new records. The records that were already assigned by the rule remain assigned. You can reactivate the rule later if you need it again.
- **Delete an assignment rule.** This removes the rule from the app completely. The records that were already assigned by the rule aren't affected. You can't undo this action.

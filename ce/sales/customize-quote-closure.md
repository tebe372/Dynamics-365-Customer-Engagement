# Customize the quote closure experience

As an administrator, you can customize the quote closure experience to suit your organization needs. You can customize the following aspects:

- Ability to quickly close a quote without opening the Quote Close dialog and entering the additional information.
- Ability to set the default value for the **Create a revised quote** field in the Quote Close dialog.


## Add Quick Quote Close button to the command bar

By default, when you close a quote, the Quote Close dialog box opens for you to enter additional information. However, not all quotes will require additional information. Your organization may want to allow quote closure for certain types of quotes. For example, you may want to allow your sellers to close a quote without opening the Quote Close dialog box for quotes that are less than $1000. 

You can add a button to the command bar to allow your sellers to close a quote without opening the Quote Close dialog box.

and you must enter the additional information. You can enable the quick quote closure experience so that you can close a quote without opening the Quote Close dialog box.

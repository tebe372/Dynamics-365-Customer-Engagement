# Provide permissions to access and share a forecast  

Provide permissions to view, access, and share a forecast in your organization.

## License and role requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise  <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator or Forecast Manager <br> More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|
|||

## Permissions step

In the **Permissions** step of the forecast configuration, you can:

- Define the owner of the forecast.
- Define team members who can view and adjust the forecast data at each level of the hierarchy.   
- Provide access to users who have specific security roles to view the forecast.  
- Enable forecast sharing to allow users to share their forecast records with other users. See [Enable or disable forecast sharing](#enable-or-disable-forecast-sharing).

## Define the forecast owner

1.	In the **User security field** section, choose **User lookup field**. Choosing this field determines the owner of the forecast row. The following default system user value is selected based on the template:        
    -	For **Org chart forecast**, the value is selected as **User**.      
    -	For **Territory forecast**, the value is selected as **Manager**.    
    If you select a value other than the default, a column is created in the forecast grid.     
    For example, when you select **User lookup field** as **Manager** for a territory forecast, the forecast is visible only to the managers of the territories in the selected hierarchy. The managers can edit forecast data that directly belongs to them and to their reporting territories.

## Provide access to additional roles 

2.	In the **Additional security roles** section, select one of the following options to provide permissions to view the forecast to users who aren't part of the hierarchy.

    | Additional security roles option | Description |
    |----------------------------------|-------------|
    | No additional security roles | This option provides access only to the selected hierarchy users. When you select this option, users who have other security roles in the organization can't view the forecast. By default, this option is selected. |
    | All security roles (everyone can access the forecast) | This option provides read-only access to this forecast to all the security roles of users in your organization. |
	| Specific security roles | This option allows you to specify which security roles will receive either read-only access, or read-only and adjustment access within this forecast.|

    > ![Forecast permissions step.](media/forecast-permissions.png "Forecast permissions step")

    A message displays at the bottom of the page that helps you understand how the forecast security is applied based on your selections.

3.	Select **Next**.

## Enable or disable forecast sharing

Forecast sharing is disabled by default. As an administrator, enable the forecast sharing option for the forecasts that needs to be shared. Users can only share forecasts that they own.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only a forecast owner can share their forecast. To know more, see [Who owns the forecast?](faqs-sales.md#who-owns-the-forecast).

**To enable or disable forecast sharing**

1.  In the Sales Hub site map, select the Change area icon ![Icon to change the work area](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area"), and then select **App Settings**.  

1.  Under **Performance management**, select **Forecast configuration**.     

1.  Select the forecast configuration that you want to enable or disable for sharing, and go to the **Permissions** step.
1. Select one of the following options in the **Share forecast** section:

    - **None**: Indicates that forecast sharing is disabled. Forecasts in the selected forecast configuration can't be shared with anyone. If users have already shared the forecasts, the forecasts will no longer be available to the shared users.
    
    - **Read-only**: Indicates that the forecast can be shared with the view permission.
    
    - **Read and adjust**: Indicates that the forecast can be shared with either the view only permission, or read and adjust permission. If you want to be able to share the forecast with different levels of access to different users, then select this setting.
    
5. Save the changes. 
   If you have selected **Read-only** or **Read and adjust**, all the forecast records in the forecast configuration are enabled for sharing. Forecast owners can now share the records. See, [Share a forecast](share-forecasts.md).

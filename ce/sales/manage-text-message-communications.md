## Prerequisites

Before you start using the inbound text message feature, verify that the following prerequisites are met:

- The text message feature is enabled with the callback URL configured to receive incoming (replies) messages. For more information on callback URL, see step 4 in [Set up the SMS provider in Dynamics 365 Sales](configure-sms-provider.md#set-up-the-sms-provider-in-dynamics-365-sales).

More information: [Enable the in-app notification feature](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/send-in-app-notifications?tabs=clientapi#enable-the-in-app-notification-feature)      

- You must have the Salesperson privileges to receive incoming messages. If you have insufficient privileges, you're notified about the same through the in-app notification center. Contact your administrator to get sufficient privileges to us the text message feature. More information: [Salesperson permissions for the SMS feature](sms-intro.md#salesperson-roles-sms-feature) 

## How incoming text messages are routed?

The incoming messages (replies) are attached to a record with the phone number from which the outbound message was sent. If same phone number is associated with multiple records, then the incoming messages are routed to the record in the following priority order: 

-	Contain an existing conversation between the seller and the customer.
-	Owned by a seller to whom the incoming message is addressed.
-	Owned by a seller who belongs to the team owning the phone number.
-	Record entity type in following order: 
    -	Contact
    -	Account
    -	Opportunity
    -	Lead
-	Active record receives the message over the inactive record.
-	Updated most recently.

When you receive a message from a number that isn't associated with a record, a new lead is created with the number and the incoming message is linked to that lead.

## Open text message conversations

You can only view conversations if the outbound phone number or record is assigned to you or your team. To view the conversations, use one of the following ways:

- **Activities grid**: 
    
    1. Go to the **Activities** grid and select **Conversation** > **My text messages** from the view selector.   
    
        A list of conversation that is related you is displayed.  
    
    1. Double-click the conversation and the conversation pane opens on the right-side of the page.  
        
- **Record**: 
    
    1. Open a record (account, contact, lead, or opportunity).   
    
    1.  Select the message icon corresponding to a phone number (Business Phone or Mobile Phone),  
        
        >[!NOTE]
        >For opportunity records, open the **Activity** tab and then double-click a conversation that you want to view.
        
        The conversation pane opens on the right-side of the page.
        
- **Notification center**: 

    1. Open your sales app and on the navigation bar, select the bell icon.
        
        The in-app notifications are displayed. 
            
    1. Select the notification. 
        
        The **Activities** grid opens with the list of conversations related to you.
    
    1. Double-click a conversation.  

        The conversation pane opens on the right-side of the page.

- Send and receive text messages.

- Choose templates to send personalized messages. 

- Choose a phone number to send a message.

- View the history of the conversation related to the record.

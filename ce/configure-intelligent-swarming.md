# Configure intelligent swarming for complex cases

As an administrator, you can help transform your organization into a unified customer service team by configuring your applications so that agents and subject matter experts can "swarm" together when resolving complext cases, including using Customer Service workspace and Microsoft Teams.

Some of the key benefits of intelligent swarming include:

- Intelligent expert finder: Find the best-suited subject matter experts who have the needed skills
- Notifications: Notify and invite relevant subject matter experts in Teams
- Simple, collaborative interface: Show users relevant information and enable real-time collaboration in Customer Service or the swarm group chat in Teams.

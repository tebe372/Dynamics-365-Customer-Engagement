# Engage with communities by using the community portal



Keep your customer engagement strong by growing a community, publishing articles, gathering user feedback, and acting on user-provided ideas. With out-of-the-box solutions available with portals you can:

-   Allow your users to hold conversations by posting messages on a forum. A forum can contain a number of topics, also known as threads, and can be replied to by many users. More information: [Set up and moderate forums](setup-moderate-forums.md)  

-   Manage multiple corporate or community blogs on a single portal, with multiple authors per blog. More information: [Manage blogs](manage-blogs.md)  

-   Engage with and gather feedback from your community, including gather ideas, votes, and comments on suggestions. More information: [Crowdsource ideas](crowdsource-ideas.md)

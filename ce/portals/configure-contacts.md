# Configure a contact for use on a portal



After filling out the basic information for a contact in Dynamics 365, (or having a user fill it out the signup form in a portal), navigate to the web authentication tab on the portal contact form to configure a contact using local authentication. For details on federated authentication options see [Set authentication identity for a portal](set-authentication-identity.md). To configure a contact for portals using local authentication, follow these instructions:  

1.  Enter a **username**.

<!-- -->

1.  On the command ribbon, click **More Commands** &gt; **Change Password**.

Complete the change password workflow, and the necessary fields will be automatically configured. When you have done this, your contact will be configured for your portals.

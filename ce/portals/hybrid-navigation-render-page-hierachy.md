# Render up to three levels of page hierarchy by using hybrid navigation

Applies To: Dynamics 365 (online), Dynamics CRM Online

This example renders a type of hybrid navigation, based on the portal sitemap, that renders up to three levels of page hierarchy. The rules of this component are:

The ancestor pages of the current page will be shown, back to the Home page (or to the maximum depth specified by the optional depth\_offset parameter).

If the current page has children, those child pages will be shown.

If the current page has no children, the siblings of the current page will be shown.

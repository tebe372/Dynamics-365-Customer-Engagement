# Configure a [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] portal
[comment]: <> (Can be combined with other topics)
Learn how to configure portals and customize [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] portals offer powerful customization options to:

- [Configure site settings for portals to modify the behavior or visual style of a portal](configure-site-settings.md)  
- [Add dynamic content to pages and create a wide variety of custom templates](custom-templates-dynamic-content.md)  
- [Associate an authenticated portal user with either a [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] contact or system user](configure-contacts.md)  
- [Authenticate portal users](set-authentication-identity.md) by using local user credentials and external identity provider accounts. A new user can register for an account or redeem an invitation to create an account.
- Assign permissions to secure content and allow front-side editing.
- [Define entity forms and custom logic within the [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] portal](entity-forms-custom-logic.md). Let users add forms to collect data from portals. Entity forms that are created in [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] can be added to web pages in portals, or used with subgrids to build complete web applications.
- Customize [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] to [create surveys and customize questions](gather-feedback-poll.md) by combining [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] native field types with additional metadata.
- [Create and run advertisements on a portal](create-run-advertisement.md)  
- [Gather feedback by using polls on a portal](gather-feedback-poll.md)  
- [Rate or vote on a webpage or blog post on a portal](rate-webpage-blog-post.md)  
- [Redirect to a new URL on a portal](add-redirect-url.md)
- [Walkthrough: Get Dynamics 365 data on the Portal](walkthrough-get-data-on-portal.md)

# Project Service Automation integration

Applies To: Dynamics 365 (online), Dynamics CRM Online

The Project Service Automation (PSA) solution for Dynamics 365 can now be installed on a Partner Portal (PSA for Dynamics 365 and Partner Portal Solutions must be installed first). With this solution installed customers and partners will be able to view projects and confirmed bookable resources. Customers will also be able to approve quotes, view invoices, and view contract/order forms.

## View projects on the partner portal

Both Customers and Partners can view projects pertaining to them on the Partner Portal. Customers can view Active and Closed Projects associated with their organization. Partners can view projects when a Bookable Resource from their organization is associated with the projected.

After logging in to the portal, the customer or partner can view the project by going to **Customer Projects**. From here they can see basic information for each project and choose to view by Active Projects, Closed Projects, or All Projects.

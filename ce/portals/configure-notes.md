# Notes configuration for web forms for portals

Web Form Notes are configured in an identical fashion to Entity Form Notes. First, Create a Metadata record for the Web Form Step that has notes, and add configuration metadata. This process is described here.

Just like with Subgrids, adding notes to your Managed forms on the portal is easy - just add the notes control to the [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] form through the out-of-the-box [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] form designer and youâ€™re done. You can configure the behavior of the notes control by using metadata.

> [!Note]                                                           
> Explicit [Add record-based security using entity permissions for portals](assign-entity-permissions.md) are **required** for any notes to appear on the portal. For read and edit, the 'Read' and 'Write' privileges must be granted. For create, two permissions must exist, a permission with the 'Create' and 'Append' privileges must be granted for the note (annotation) entity, the second permission must be assigned to the entity type the note is being attached to with the 'Append To' privilege granted.

To Edit or Add notes, among other things, you must configure the control using a metadata record.

To add Metadata to an Entity form, navigate to **Entity Form Metadata** either using the top drop-down or the subgrid right on the main form of the Entity Form record that you are working with. Then click to add a new record.

When Creating your record, select Type of Notes. You will then be able to add Note configuration:

Upon adding the Configuration, the Note control will render with the appropriate options enabled on the portal.

Most settings are shown collapsed to save space by default. Click "" to expand a section and see additional options. Click "" to collapse a section.

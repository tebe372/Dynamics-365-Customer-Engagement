> [!NOTE]
> The Common Data Service starter portal cannot be used on a Common Data Service environment.

## Provision a Common Data Service starter portal

A Common Data Service starter portal is provisioned in the same way as any other portal. The only difference is that you select an environment that uses Common Data Service. After selecting the instance, the only portal type you see is **Common Data Service Starter Portal**. This portal type is the same for all portal audiences. For more information on provisioning a portal, see [Provision a portal](provision-portal.md).

After specifying all the required values, the **Configure your portal** page looks as follows:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Configure settings for your Common Data Service starter portal](media/provision-cds-portal.png "Configure settings for your Common Data Service starter portal")

Once the portal is provisioned, a website with the sample pages is available. You can then use them to quickly get started.

## Change the instance, audience, or type of portal

After your portal is created and provisioned, you can change the instance associated with your portal to the one that uses Common Data Service. After selecting the instance, the only portal type you see is **Common Data Service Starter Portal**. This portal type is the same for all portal audiences. For more information on changing the instance, see [Change the instance, audience, or type of portal](change-dynamics-instance.md).

After specifying all the required values, the **Select Dynamics 365 Instance** window looks as follows:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Change instance](media/change-instance.png "Change instance")

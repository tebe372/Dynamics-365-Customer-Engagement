## Forum attributes used by portals

The table below explains many of the Forum attributes used by portals. It is important to note that the way many of the content and display-oriented attributes are rendered is controlled by the page template used, and thus by the portal developer.

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

  | Partial URL values are used as URL path segments. As such, they should not contain illegal URL path characters, such as "?", "\#", "!", "%". Because portal URLs are generated by joining together partial URL values with slashes ("/"), they should also not contain slashes. |                  
  | ![image6](media/image6.png) **Note **                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                    
  | We recommend you restrict Partial URL values to letters, numbers, and hyphens or underscores. For example: "press-releases", "Users\_Guide", "product1".                                                                                                                        |                  |
| Display Order        | An integer value indicating the order in which the forum will be placed relative to other forums in a listing.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Publishing State     | The current publishing workflow state of the forum, which may dictate whether the forum is visible on the site. The most common use of this feature is to control whether content is in a published or draft state.

  | Users with content management permissions may be granted the ability to use Preview Mode, which allows these users to see ("preview") unpublished content. |                                                                                                                                       |
| Hidden From Sitemap  | Controls whether the forum is visible as part of the portal site map. If this value is selected, the forum will still be available on the site at its URL, and can be linked to, but standard navigational elements such as menus will not include the forum.                                       |

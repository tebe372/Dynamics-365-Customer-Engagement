Portals allows customization by using entities and some WYSIWYG support through its front-end editing tools in the portal runtime. A new and simplified portal editor is now available for Portals customizers that will help to reduce the learning curve on Portals customization and increase a customizer's productivity.

> [!NOTE]
> - Portal’s out-of-the-box administrator web role and any contact linked to that web role can use the new editor.
> - Only contacts with a web role that has the following authorizations will be able to navigate to the new editor.
>   - The following website access permissions should be enabled:
>       - Manage Content Snippets
>       - Manage Site Markers
>       - Manage Web Link Sets
>       - Preview Unpublished Entities <br/>
>       More information: [Create website access permissions](website-access-permission.md)
>   - Webpage access permission must be set to **Grant Change** on the Home (root) page of the portal website needs to be enabled. More information: [Control webpage access for portals](webpage-access-control.md)
> - Drag and drop is not currently supported on the canvas. It will come in a subsequent release.

## Navigate to another page

After making changes to a page, you might want to make changes to other pages in your portal. To navigate to another page, select the required header link, and then select **Go to Link**.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Navigate to another page](media/move-to-another-page.png "Navigate to another page")

## Go back to the old editor

If you want to go back to the old editor, select **Back to classic editor** in the header.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Go back to the old editor](media/back-to-classic-editor.png "Go back to the old editor")

## Test language change in editor

To use multiple languages in the editor, you must have a language pack installed in portal solutions and also enabled on the portal. Once multiple language is enabled for the portal, you can see the language change option in the header of the portal runtime. More information: [Enable multiple languages for a portal](enable-multiple-language-support.md)

After selecting the new language, navigate to the new editor to see content in the portal in the selected language.

## Known issues

- When you edit the content snippet of the page heading and press the spacebar at the end points of text block, white space is displayed over the page.

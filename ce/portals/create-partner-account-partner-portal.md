# Create a partner account on a partner relationship management (PRM) portal

[comment]: <> (can be merged with other topics. See also missing)
You can use partner accounts to keep track of your various partners. We recommend creating a separate account for each partner so that you can manage each partner organization separately.

## Create a partner account

1. Go to **Sales** &gt; **Accounts**.
2. Choose **New** and fill in your information.
3. In the **Partner Details** area, use the **Classification** field and select the Partner classification.
4. Select **Save**.

## Associate partner contacts with an account

[!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] contacts become partner contacts when they are associated with a partner account. To associate a contact with a partner account when creating or editing a contact, enter the name of a partner account in the Account Name field.

# Legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 FAQ

We have compiled a list of frequently asked questions about changes coming for legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 and provided brief answers to help you get to your information quickly.

## What is being announced about legacy Adxstudio Portals v7?

On September 14, 2017, Microsoft announced transition options from legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 to Microsoft Dynamics 365 – Portals and a formal support channel to assist customers with the transition to these new portal options.

Microsoft began the process of ceasing new license sales for the legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 product in late 2016. As a continuation of this effort, formal support for legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 will end on August 1, 2018. Microsoft is advising customers (and their partners) to use this interim timeframe to plan ahead for the August 1, 2018, deadline and determine the best transition path forward.

## Why is Microsoft making these changes?

Consistent with Microsoft’s approach to prioritizing cloud first applications, Microsoft has decided to end support for legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 on August 1, 2018, to provide the best unified experience across all current Microsoft Dynamics 365 business applications.

## Can my organization continue to use legacy Adxstudio Portals v7, and for how long?

Microsoft strongly recommends that customers migrate their portals to Microsoft Dynamics 365.

All support (including critical bug fixes and security issues) ends on August 1, 2018. Customers that purchased Adxstudio v7 via a perpetual license can continue to use the unsupported legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 for as long as they wish.

A limited number of customers purchased legacy Adxstudio v7 via an on-premises subscription license. Portals using this license type will stop working on August 1, 2018. On-premises subscription customers that need additional time to migrate their solution should contact [adxquest@microsoft.com](mailto:adxquest@microsoft.com) to request a temporary extension of their subscription license. Please note that, regardless of any subscription extension, the product is unsupported (including critical bug fixes and security issues) after August 1, 2018.

## Are there any legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 offers available for my organization, and can I extend my organization’s subscription license?

If your organization acquired legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 via a perpetual license, you may continue to use the current legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 product beyond August 1, 2018.

If your organization uses legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 under a subscription license, and if your subscription expires before August 2018, you should contact [adxquest@microsoft.com](mailto:adxquest@microsoft.com) to get a key to use until August 2018. If your license is already active through August 2018, then you cannot extend the license and will have to migrate.

## Is legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 still being sold, and can current organizations using legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 purchase additional licenses?

No. Microsoft ended all product sales of Adxstudio Portals July 1, 2017. Customers should consider Microsoft Dynamics 365 – Portals as an alternative.

## What options are being offered to my organization?

Please refer to the [Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Team Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2017/09/14/changes-coming-for-legacy-adxstudio-portals-v7/) for the most up-to-date information on the options available for your organization.

- SharePoint Document Management
- Shopping cart and payment
- Any other Legacy Portal template or feature which is not in Dynamics 365 Portals

## Is Microsoft able to recommend the best solution for my organization?

Microsoft cannot recommend the best migration path as each scenario will vary on a case-by-case basis.

We recommend customers work closely with their original implementation team or a Microsoft partner who has experience in both legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 and Microsoft Dynamics 365 – Portals that can help with appropriate evaluation and determine solution options. If you need to locate a partner in your region, please contact your Microsoft account contact.

## What kind of support options are available?

Support options will vary depending on your situation and desired approach.

1. If you choose to migrate to Microsoft Dynamics 365 – Portals, you may need assistance evaluating a feature fit and performing the actual migration work.

    If your organization does not have a technical team with portal implementation experience or a Microsoft partner, you will need to obtain migration support from experienced Microsoft partners (separate Partner fees will apply).

    Microsoft has created documentation with technical details of the migration process that may assist you in some aspects of migrating your portal, but will not cover all steps that might be necessary. This document will not include strategies for some items from the legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 that are not available in new Microsoft Dynamics 365 Portals solution. If you have questions around the items that are not included in the documentation, please refer to your Microsoft partner or technical implementation team.

    Once migration is complete, ongoing product support for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Portals will be available from [Microsoft Customer Service & Support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/support). Please note that Microsoft support will not include help with enabling legacy items translation or troubleshooting the migration process from an old to new portal solution.

2. If you choose to download the Microsoft Dynamics 365 – Portals source code v8.3, there will be no Microsoft support available for critical bug fixes or security issues effective immediately.

3. If you choose to continue using legacy Adxstudio Portals v7, Microsoft will provide support to fix critical bugs and security issues until August 1, 2018.

Product support for legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 is offered through paid support tickets or bundled with various services and entitlements such as MSDN and Premier agreements. Product support for legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 will end on August 1, 2018.

## Can the support deadline be extended past August 1, 2018?

Once you migrate to Microsoft Dynamics 365 – Portals, you will receive ongoing product support. Current organizations using legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 can continue to request legacy Adxstudio Portals v7 support until August 1, 2018. However, support will be discontinued effective August 1, 2018 and this deadline cannot be extended.

## Is the Microsoft Dynamics 365 – Portals source code v8.3 an open source model that allows for community contributions, and which versions of Dynamics 365 are supported?

Microsoft will not be posting the Microsoft Dynamics 365 – Portals v8.3 code on GitHub where there may be community expectations for community contributions. Microsoft is not accepting community contributions to the source code, but the community has no restriction from customizing the code themselves.

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 – Portals source code version has the same CRM dependencies as our online portal service, and requires Dynamics CRM v8.1 or newer.

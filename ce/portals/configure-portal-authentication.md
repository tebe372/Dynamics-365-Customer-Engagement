# Configure Dynamics 365 portal authentication



In a portal application, an authenticated portal user is associated with either a Dynamics 365 contact or system user. The default portals configuration is contact-based. To log in, a contact must have the appropriate web authentication information configured. Portal users must be assigned to a web roles to gain permissions beyond unauthenticated users. To configure permissions for a web role, configure its webpage access and website access control rules.

To take an in-depth look at configuration of out-of-the-box registration modes and invitation model, see [Register and invite for a portal](register-invite.md).

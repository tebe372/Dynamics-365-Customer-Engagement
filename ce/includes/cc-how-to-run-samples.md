1. Download or clone the [Dynamics365-Apps-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples) repo so that you have a local copy.
2. (Optional) Edit the cds/App.config file to define a connection string specifying the Common Data Service instance you want to connect to.
3. Open the sample solution in Visual Studio and press **F5** to run the sample. After you specify a connection string in cds/App.config, any sample you run will use that connection information.

If you don't specify a connection string in cds/App.config file, a dialog opens each time you run the sample, and you'll need to enter information about which Dataverse instance you want to connect to and which credentials you want to use. This dialog caches previous connections so that you can choose a previously used connection.

Those samples in this repo that require a connection to a Common Data Service instance to run includes a linked reference to the cds/App.config file.

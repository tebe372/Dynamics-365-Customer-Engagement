Direct user account membership in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 privusergroup security group is required and group membership nesting under privusergroup currently is not supported. Granting membership to privusergroup through another security group can cause system-wide failures in the web application and reporting features. For example, if you add a security group named mycrmprivgroupusers to privusergroup, members of mycrmprivgroupusers will not resolve as privusergroup members. This includes the CRMAppPool or the SQL Server Reporting Services service identities.

### Which email address I should use for signing up?

You can use of the following ways to sign up for a trial:

- If your company has an existing relationship with Microsoft and you're allowed to do self-service trials, use your company email address. We'll establish your trial on your company’s account. To purchase a license, follow up with the administrator of your Microsoft corporate account.

- If your company doesn't have an existing relationship with Microsoft or you aren’t allowed to do self-service trials on your company’s existing account, we'll create a temporary account for you. Use your personal email to sign up for trial and you'll be the administrator on the account and for the trial.

- If you're a business establishing a new relationship with Microsoft, use your business email address to set up your account. You can carry forward the account and retain it if you choose to purchase the license.

### I don’t remember the link for my trial instance  

No problem. We’ve got you covered. When you sign up for the trial, you'll receive an email with the trial instance details. In case you don't see it in your inbox, check your spam folder. Alternatively, use the following steps to access your instance:

2.	Enter the email ID that you used, to sign up for the trial.  
    You'll be redirected to your trial instance.

### Why did my trial expire before 30 days?

It's possible that there's no activity on the trial instance for 14 consecutive days. An email notification is sent to you after seven days of inactivity. The trial expires if there is no activity for another seven days.  

### Can I sign up for multiple Dynamics 365 apps such as Sales, Marketing, Customer Service?

Yes, you can. Access the [trial site]() for the app and sign up. You can use the same email account to sign up for multiple trials. However, each trial instance will be on a different organization and as such the data won’t be shared across apps.

### Which email address I should use for signing up?

You can use of the following ways to sign up for a trial:

- If your company has an existing relationship with Microsoft and you're allowed to do self-service trials, use your company email address. We'll establish your trial on your company’s account. This is the fastest way to sign up for the trial.  

- If your company doesn't have an existing relationship with Microsoft or you aren’t allowed to do self-service trials on your company’s existing account, we'll create a temporary account for you. Use your personal email to sign up for trial and you'll be the administrator on the account and for the trial.

- If you're a business establishing a new relationship with Microsoft, use your business email address to set up your account. You can carry forward the account and retain it if you choose to purchase the license.

### What are the system requirements for the trial?

- This is a cloud-based service that doesn't require special software other than an up-to-date web browser, though some restrictions apply. [Learn more about web application requirements](/power-platform/admin/web-application-requirements)

> [!NOTE]
> For the best trial experience, avoid accessing the trial site in incognito mode.  

No problem. We’ve got you covered. When you sign up for the trial, you'll receive an email with the trial instance details. In case you don't see it in your inbox, check your spam folder. Alternatively, use the following steps to access your instance:
 
1.	Go to trial site and select **Try for free**.  
2.	Enter the email ID that you used, to sign up for the trial.  
    You'll be redirected to your trial instance.  

### How do I sign up for the trial without a Microsoft 365 tenant?

You can enter a non-work email address and we automatically create a tenant for you.

### What are the trial limits and quotas?

The following limitations apply for the trial:

- The trial instance is available to you for 30 days. After that, you can request for an extension for another 30 days or buy a paid license or sign up for a new trial.  
- The trial will expire if there’s no activity on the instance for 14 consecutive days. Expired trials cannot be reactivated. However, you can start a new trial.  
- You can have only one active trial per app at any given time. However, you can sign up again after your current trial for the app ends.  
 

### How can I add more users to a trial?

To add users, go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) using the trial admin account. Follow the [admin center guidance](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) to add users up to the trial license limit.

### How do I extend the trial?

You can extend the trial for another 30 days in the admin center. For instructions, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/commerce/try-or-buy-microsoft-365?view=o365-worldwide#extend-your-trial.


### How do I reset the trial environment?


### Why did my trial expire before 30 days?

It's possible that there's no activity on the trial instance for 14 consecutive days. An email notification is sent to you after seven days of inactivity. The trial expires if there's no activity for another seven days. Expired trials cannot be reactivated. However, you can start a new trial.  

### Can I sign up for multiple Dynamics 365 apps such as Sales, Marketing, Customer Service?

Yes, you can. Access the [trial site]() for the app and sign up. You can use the same email account to sign up for different trials. However, at this point, it is not possible to have multiple apps in the same trial site. Each trial instance will be on a different org and URL and as such the data won’t be shared across apps.  

### Can I convert the trial to a paid license?

 Yes, you can purchase licenses through direct, credit card purchase at admin.microsoft.com. Or, you can work with sales to establish a volume licensing or enterprise agreement. Visit our [Pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/) page for more information on pricing and purchase. To purchase the license on an existing account, work with the administrator of the account to apply for licenses.  

Once you have applied for the license to your tenant, you can publish your environment to production. You can remove the sample data. However, you have to manually reset the configuration and  remove any test data that you've added. We recommend that you create a fresh environment to use for your production environment and add the configurations you’d like to move forward with.

- **Attribute display name**: We recommend that you select the attributes defined in the following table. You don't need to select the out-of-the-box system defined attributes, such as Created By, Created On, Modified By, Modified On, and Owner. You can select custom attributes if required.

If required, you can use the advanced find option to construct the appropriate fetch xml query. For illustration, the sample query is listed in the following table to get single or multiple records.

Quick scheduling (sometimes referred to as quick book) simplifies the schedule assistant experience to make scheduling easier and quicker.

Within the same window of a work order, a panel will appear showing available booking time slots with a single click.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the quick schedule pane appearing over an open work order](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book.png)

This is useful in several scenarios:

1. Organizations with a high volume of bookings that they need to quickly schedule. 
2. Organizations with homogeneous resources who are more concerned with quickly understanding availability and don't need the extra information and filter abilities of the schedule assistant.
3. For people whose job might not primarily be scheduling. For example, a customer service rep spends most of his or her time handling customer issues, and the few times he or she needs to schedule, it should be quick and easy.

When quick scheduling is not enabled, the book button defaults to the full schedule assistant experience that displays additional information and filter options for more comprehensive resource assigning.

## Prerequisites

- Field Service v8.7+. See the additional notes section at the end of this article for more details.

- Quick scheduling must be enabled: 
  - Go to **Resource Scheduling** > **Settings** > **Administration** > **Enable Resource Scheduling for Entities**.

  - Double-click an entity to display the entity's **Booking Setup Metadata**.

  - Set **Enable Quick Book** to **Yes**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Enable Quick Book set to "Yes"](../field-service/media/scheduling-enable-quick-book.png)

In the previous example, we enabled quick book for the work order entity, meaning quick book will trigger from the work order form and requirements created by work orders.

Some organizations use requirements on their own for scheduling, unrelated to entities like work orders. Organizations like this should enable quick book for the **Default Metadata Settings (none)** option.

## Quick book a single resource

### 1. Create a work order

First, create a work order or another entity that is enabled for scheduling and quick booking.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a new work order entity](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-create-work-order.png)

Then go to the related requirement and add additional attributes.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the related resource requirement](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-requirement.png)

In our previous example screenshot, we are looking for a resource within the specified date range with the "Assembly Repair" skill and part of the "Seattle" organizational unit.

### 2. Select book

From the requirement or the work order, select **Book** in the top ribbon. This opens the quick book side panel. If quick book is not enabled, the **Book** button triggers the schedule assistant interface.

Next, select a time slot and then **Book** at the bottom.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the quick book side panel triggered from a work order](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book.png)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a quick book booking summary in the side panel](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-confirmation.png)


In the background, the system chooses an available resource that also meets requirement criteria like skills, organizational unit, and so on.

If the requirement is location-based, as in the case of on site work orders or facilities, the system chooses the closest resource. The closest resource is determined based on the resource's starting location or previous work order location. 

For location-agnostic requirements, the system chooses the first available resource based on alphabetical order of the resource's first name. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the filter and map view including resources and the booking](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-schedule-board.png)

### 3. Filter options 
Though quick scheduling is designed for quick and easy scheduling, there are a few simple filters in the quick book pane.

The date range is taken from the requirement date range and can be changed.

> [!Note]
> Time parameters on the work order like **Date Window Start and End** are passed down to requirements and are factored into quick booking.

The **Filters** option allows you to search through all resources (meaning all resources that meet the requirement criteria) or select a specific resource to quick book (only if the selected resource meets the criteria).

Additionally, select the resource icon next to a time slot to see a simple list of applicable resources for that time slot. See the following screenshot for reference.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the resources icon in the quick book panel](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-select-resources.png)

This displays more details like travel time and distance, but still with a simpler interface and with fewer details than the full schedule assistant. The schedule assistant can still be triggered by selecting the **Open Schedule Assistant** link at the bottom of the quick book panel.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the quick book panel, including the link that opens the schedule assistant](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-select-resources2.png)

## Quick book multiple resources

Quick scheduling also works with requirement groups, which allow organizations to schedule multiple resources at once. 

### 1. Create a requirement group

Go to **Resource Scheduling** > **Requirement Groups** > **+New**. 

Use the requirement group control to define the multiple resources needed. Each row represents a resource requirement.

In the following screenshot example, we need two resources each with different skills but part of the same Seattle organizational unit, and we need them for two hours.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a requirement group entity with 2 requirements listed](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-rg.png)

For further details, see the [topic on requirement groups](../field-service/multi-resource-scheduling-requirement-groups.md).

Select a row and open the form to edit more fields.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of requirement group details](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-rg-open-form.png)

These requirements call for resource types **contact, user, and account**, and have a work location of **Onsite** with a defined location (latitude and longitude). This means we are sending resources to the customer's location.
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of resource requirements with attention to type and location](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-rg-open-form2and3.png)

Next, from the requirement group control, select **Book** to trigger quick book.

Again, you can select a time slot and then **Book** to assign the requirement group to multiple resources, or you can select the resource icon to see different combinations of resources that fulfill the requirement group.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the quick book panel showing a calendar and a list of resource groups](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-rg-results-onsite.png)

The results are displayed in order of average travel time and distance; because each resource may be traveling from a different location, travel time and distance is calculated as the average. 

Lastly, as discussed in the [requirement groups topic](../field-service/multi-resource-scheduling-requirement-groups.md), requirement groups can include different option sets and quick book will respect these. In the following example, we want to schedule a single resource with both required skills *or* two resources, each with one of our required skill.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the requirement group settings, showing different resource options](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-rg-option.png)

To utilize requirement groups as part of the work order process, associate a requirement group template to an incident type. See more details in the [requirement groups for work orders](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/multi-resource-scheduling-requirement-groups#requirement-groups-for-work-orders) section of the requirement groups topic.

## Configuration considerations

- After quick booking a *single requirement*, selecting **Book** again for the same requirement will create an additional booking, and will not re-book the previous one. Selecting **Book** again for a *requirement group* will trigger the re-book process, which cancels previous bookings.
  
- If you have enabled quick book, you enable it for your entire organization; it can't be enabled only for specific users or security roles. 

### Consider using fulfillment preferences with quick scheduling

The purpose of quick scheduling is to simplify the scheduling process. Fulfillment preferences further simplify scheduling by organizing quick book (or schedule assistant) results in neat time blocks. By default, quick scheduling uses a fulfillment preference with 30-minute intervals for single requirements, and 30-minute intervals with 10 results per interval for requirement groups. To apply a custom fulfillment preference and override the default:

1. Create a fulfillment preference. In this example we created a fulfillment preference with 1-hour intervals.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of an example fulfillment preference](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-fulfillment-preference.png)

2. Add the fulfillment preference to a requirement and quick book. The quick book results will appear in hourly intervals.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the quick book panel with 1-hour intervals](../field-service/media/scheduling-quick-book-fulfillment-preference-results.png)

See our [topic on fulfillment preferences](../field-service/set-up-time-groups.md) for more information. 


## Additional notes
- The confirmation message shown after quick book is currently not configurable. 
- When quick book is enabled and applicable to the scheduleable entity, it will trigger wherever the **Book** button is displayed.
- Quick book is **disabled** by default in Field Service v8.7 (Universal Resource Scheduling v3.7), but is **enabled** by default in v8.8+ and 3.8+.
- With Field Service v8.7 (Universal Resource Scheduling v3.7), quick book is not applicable to onsite requirements. With 8.8+ and 3.8+, it is applicable to onsite, facility, and location agnostic requirements.

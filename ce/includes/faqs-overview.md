An AI system includes not only the technology but also the people who use it, the people who are affected by it, and the environment in which it's deployed. Our Responsible AI FAQs are intended to help you understand how AI technology works, the choices that system owners and users can make that influence system performance and behavior, and the importance of thinking about the whole system: the technology, the people, and the environment.

Our Responsible AI FAQs are part of a broader effort to put our AI principles into practice. To learn more, see [Microsoft AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai).

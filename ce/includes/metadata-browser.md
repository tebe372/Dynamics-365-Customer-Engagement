To view the entity metadata for your organization, install the Metadata Browser solution described in [Browse the metadata for your organization](../developer/browse-your-metadata.md). You can also view the metadata for an uncustomized organization in the Excel file called EntityMetadata.xlsx included in the top-level folder of the [SDK download](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=512122).

## Can't find the options in your app?
There are two possibilities:

- You do not have the necessary [license or role](#license-and-role-requirements) to perform the steps.  

- Your organization might be using a custom app and hence the site map and UI will be different. The steps described in this documentation are specific to the out-of-the-box Sales Hub app. Check with your administrator for the exact steps.

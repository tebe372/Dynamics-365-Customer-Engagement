Before you configure context variables for Azure or Power Virtual Agents bots, check for the following conditions:

- Use the context variable names "as-is", and don't change them when you author flows in Azure or Power Virtual Agents bots.
- The length of the context variable name must be less than or equal to 100 characters.
- The context variable value must be less than or equal to 4,000 characters.
- Use exact match to pass the value to the context variable because it is case-sensitive.

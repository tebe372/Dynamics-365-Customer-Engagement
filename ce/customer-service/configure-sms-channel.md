# Configure an SMS channel for TeleSign

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

An SMS channel allows your organization to connect to customers by using text messages. After you configure an SMS channel, your customers can send text messages and connect with a customer service agent. This provides your customers the flexibility to connect with their mobile devices when an internet connection is not available to connect to a chat channel.

Agents can view incoming SMS requests on their dashboard and respond accordingly.

The tasks to add SMS support for TeleSign are as follows:

1. Enable SMS channel in your Dynamics 365 organization.

2. Register with TeleSign and get your customer ID and API key, and purchase a phone number.

3. Add SMS support through Omnichannel for Customer Service.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The maximum number of characters supported for sent and received messages is 1600.
> - SMS is an asynchronous mode of communication. Agents can close the conversation and then work on them later. Ending the conversation will mark it as resolved. More information: [Understand conversation states](oc-conversation-state.md)

## Enable SMS channel in your Dynamics 365 organization

You can enable the SMS channel from the Dynamics 365 Administration Center. For steps on enabling SMS in your organization as a part of provisioning Omnichannel for Customer Service, see [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](omnichannel-provision-license.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The SMS channel is available only if you have an active subscription of Dynamics 365 for Customer Service Digital Messaging.

## Sign up for TeleSign account

An SMS channel can be enabled within Omnichannel for Customer Service by integrating with TeleSign. This integration uses public APIs of TeleSign for sending and receiving text messages. You must sign up for a TeleSign account to enable an SMS channel in your organization.

To sign up for TeleSign

1. Go to [TeleSign](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2127719) to sign up for a self-service account, and upgrade to standard or enterprise account for a complete integration with Omnichannel for Customer Service. If you expect to send high volumes of SMS traffic, such as more than 100,000 messages per month, contact [TeleSign support](mailto:support@telesign.com) to request an invoiced enterprise account.

2. Purchase support phone numbers through your TeleSign account.

3. Get the customer ID and API key from your TeleSign account. You will need to provide these while setting up the SMS channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

4. You are provided with a callback URL that must be sent to [TeleSign support](mailto:support@telesign.com). This callback URL is specific to your organization and is available when you add SMS support for your organization. When you send an email to TeleSign support, include the callback URL, your customer ID, and enter the subject line as **Omnichannel for Customer Service callback URL update request**.

## Flow of data between Omnichannel for Customer Service - SMS channel and TeleSign

### Incoming text messages

For an incoming text message sent by a customer to the support phone number, the message is first sent to the TeleSign service and then pushed by TeleSign to Omnichannel for Customer Service using the callback URL. After this, the message gets routed and associated to either a new or an existing conversation by Omnichannel for Customer Service.

### Outgoing text messages

For an outgoing message sent by an agent from within Dynamics 365, the message is first sent to the TeleSign service and then TeleSign sends it to the customer. In addition to the text message, Omnichannel for Customer Service uses the APIs provided by TeleSign to send the customer's phone number, support phone number (TeleSign SenderID), and the TeleSign account information (CustomerID and the API Key) to the TeleSign service.

### TeleSign API Key Validation

When you validate the API key while setting up the SMS channel, a call is made to TeleSign to validate customer ID and the API key.

## Add SMS support in Omnichannel Administration

2. Select **New** to create a workstream. On the **Work Distribution** tab, enter the following information:

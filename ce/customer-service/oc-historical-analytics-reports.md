1. Select **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.

2. Select **Security** > **Security roles**.

3. Select the security role that you want to provide access for. For example, Omnichannel supervisor.

4. Select **Custom Entities** tab and select an entity, for example Omnichannel Historical analytics.

5. Select **Save and Close**. The Omnichannel supervisor will now be able to see the historical anaytics report.

You can see the following reports by navigating to **Omnichannel for Customer Service**, creating a new session tab, and selecting **Omnichannel historical analytics**. The **Conversation** page is displayed.

# Configure Omnichannel historical analytics reports

You can configure historical analytics to give your service managers a combination of BI analytics and AI insights for their organization. The reports use natural language understanding to automatically detect the language used in your support conversations and group related support conversations into topics. 

The following historical analytics reports are available:

[Conversation report](oc-conversation-dashboard.md)
[Queue report](oc-queue-dashboard.md)
[Agent report](agent-dashboard.md)
[Bot report](oc-bot-dashboard.md)
[Conversation Topics report](oc-conversation-topics-dashboard.md)

### View Omnichannel historical analytics reports

The service managers must have either the system administrator or the CSR manager role to view the reports.

1. In Dynamics 365, select **Settings**, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

2. On the page that appears, select **Security**, and then select **Security roles**.

3. Select the security role that you want to provide access for. For example, Omnichannel supervisor.

5. Select **Save and Close**. The Omnichannel supervisor will now be able to see the historical analytics report.

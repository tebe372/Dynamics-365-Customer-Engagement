# Work with queues

Use queues to organize, prioritize, and monitor the progress of your work. In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, queues are containers used to store anything that needs to be completed or requires an action, such as completing a task or closing a case. To know more about creating and managing queues, see [Create and manage queues](set-up-queues-manage-activities-cases.md).

The option for agents to manage their queues and items is also available in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) 9.1. More information: [New features in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](../customerengagement/on-premises/whats-new.md#enhancements-in-the-queue-page)

## Find the queue item

Use the view list and queue list to filter and find items in queues.

1. Go to **Service** > **Queues**.
2. Select a view, and then select a filter to see the items you want.

## Find all items in queues

1. To see all cases from a selected queue, in the view list, select **All Items in Selected Queues**.

2. In the queue list, choose one of the following options to filter cases based on queues:
   - \<Individual queues>
   - All Queues
   - All Public Queues
   - Queues I'm a member of

## Find cases that are available to work on

1. To see cases that no one else is working on, in the view list, select **Cases Available to Work On**.

   - \<Individual queues>
   - All Queues
   - All Public Queues

## Find cases that you're working on

1. To see only the cases that you're currently working on, in the view list, select **Cases I'm Working On**.

   - \<Individual queues>
   - All Queues
   - All Public Queues
   - Queues I'm a member of

## Find items available to work on

1. To see only items (activities and cases) that no one else is working on, in the view list, select **Items available to work on**.
2. In the queue list, choose one of the following options to filter cases based on queues:

   - \<Individual queues>
   - All Queues
   - All Public Queues
   - Queues I'm a member of

## Find items that you are working on

1. To see only items that you're currently working on, in the view list, select **Items I am working on**.
2. In the queue list, choose one of the following options to filter cases based on queues:

   - \<Individual queues>
   - All Queues
   - All Public Queues
   - Queues I'm a member of

## Pick an item to work on

1. Select **Service**.
2. Select **Queues**.
3. Select a view from the System Views menu.
4. Select the queues from the menu.
5. Select the checkbox next to the item title to select the item.
6. Select **Pick** from the command menu. The **Pick** dialog appears.
   > ![Pick a work item.](media/pick-work-item-csh.png "Pick a work item")

7. Optionally, select **No** to change it to **Yes** if you want item from the queue.
8. Select **Pick**. The item is assigned to you and removed from the queue if you had selected **Yes** in the previous step. Also, the following updates will happen if the item is in an advanced queue and is tracked through unified routing:
   - The **Worked By** attribute of the queue item will be updated with your user ID. The unified routing system takes this as an indicator of work assignment. To manually add another user or team, select the **Worked by Lookup** from the **Queue Item details** dialog and then select the user. If the queue item is assigned to a private queue, the lookup displays only the members of that queue. 
   - Your capacity will be updated. If the work item indicated capacity consumed in units, the corresponding units will be reduced from your total available capacity. If capacity profile is configured for the work item, the available units of capacity in that profile for you will be deducted by one.
   - Your work schedule, assignment rules, skills, presence, or capacity constraints won't be evaluated during a manual pick. For example, even if you don't have enough capacity available as requested by the work item, you'll still be able to pick the work item and start working on it. This ability to manually override preconfigured capacity is to ensure that you're able to pick up work beyond your normal capacity during contingencies. More information: [Capacity profiles](capacity-profiles.md)
   - Your presence will be updated. If you have further capacity left, your presence will be set to "Busy". If you have no capacity left, your presence will be set to "Do not disturb".

   > [!NOTE]
   > Remove the items from the queue can't be set for work items in an advanced queue.

## Release an item or case that you’re working on  
  
1. In the **View** list, select one of the views that show the items or cases that you’re working on.  
  
2. Select the case or item that you want to release, and on the command bar select **Release**.  
  
   When you release an item, your name is removed from the **Worked By** field, and the item is no longer assigned to you; it’s assigned to the queue owner.

## Route an activity or case to another queue or assign to a different user or team  
  
1. Select the case that you want to move to another queue, and on the command bar, select **Route**.  
  
2. To move an activity or case to a different queue, select **Route**, and select a queue.  

    -OR-

    To assign the activity or case to another user or team to work on, select **User/Team**, and select the user or team. When you assign the activity or case to someone else to work on, the **Worked By** field is set to that user or team. You also have the option to remove the item from the queue.

After the item is released, the following updates will happen if the item is in an advanced queue and is tracked through unified routing:

- Your capacity will be updated based on whether capacity profile or capacity units have been configured.

- Your presence will be updated to "Busy" or "Available" based on your available capacity.

   If you don’t see the user or team you are looking for, select **Lookup**, and then select **Look Up More Records**. From the **Look for** dropdown list, select **User** or **Team**. In the **Search** box, type the name, select the search button, select the name, and then select **Add**.

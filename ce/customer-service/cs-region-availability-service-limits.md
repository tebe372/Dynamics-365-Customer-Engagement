## Service protection limits for AI suggestions

AI suggestions for case and knowledge was introduced in October 2020 with service protection limits on these capabilities to maintain a consistent quality of service for all our customers, but there aren't penalties if customers exceed predefined limits. Over time, Microsoft might adjust these limits in keeping with customer usage patterns and provide options for customers with high usage scenarios and patterns to purchase additional capacity in a manner that's minimally disruptive to those customers.

For information on the service protection limits for AI suggestions, see [Enable AI suggestions for similar cases and knowledge articles](csw-enable-ai-suggested-cases-knowledge-articles.md). The total limits are pooled at the tenant level based on the number of Customer Service Enterprise user licenses that are available in the tenant.

## Microsoft Power Platform capacity impact

Enabling the insights feature will impact Dataverse entitlements. For more information, see [New Microsoft Dataverse storage capacity](/power-platform/admin/capacity-storage)

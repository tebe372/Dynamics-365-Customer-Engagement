# Customer Service workspace

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Welcome to the Customer Service workspace app module, where we're increasing agent productivity for core customer service with the ability to work on multiple sessions at a time in a single workspace experience. If you choose to expand your customer service offering to provide chat and channels, the Customer Service workspace seamlessly adjusts to support managing conversations as well.

If you've used Customer Service Hub or Omnichannel for Customer Service before, much of the behavior for managing cases and activities in the Customer Service workspace app module works the same way, with some exceptions to accommodate the multisession and conversation capabilities. This article walks you through the Customer Service workspace experience and explains how to navigate the app.

Before we begin, a quick note about administration of Customer Service workspace: Currently, there isn't a dedicated administrator experience for Customer Service workspace. As such, configuring and managing core customer service capabilities, such as queues and routing rules, is done in the Customer Service Hub > [Service Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-service/service-manager-guide) experience. Channel configuration is done in [Omnichannel Administration](omnichannel-administrator.md). Because all of these apps are on [Microsoft Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro), the data created through these experiences is accessible.

## Introduction to Customer Service workspace

You can access Customer Service workspace through the app selector (where you find all of your other Dynamics 365 apps) by choosing the Customer Service workspace app tile. You can also access the app in the Dynamics 365 drop-down navigation in the upper-left corner of Dynamics 365.

As an agent with the Customer Service Representative security role, when you open Customer Service workspace, you start on the Customer Service Agent Dashboard unless your administrator has changed the default view. This dashboard shows you your active cases, cases you can work in queues you are assigned to, and your open activities. You can open existing cases and activities or begin working new cases from the queues you are assigned to and create activities. 

The following table displays the elements of the Customer Service workspace.


| Label | Description|
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 1 | The session pane lists all the sessions that you are actively working on. Select the tabs to navigate among sessions.  |
| 2 | The Home session returns you to the Customer Service Agent Dashboard view.|
| 3 | Each session has a tab in the session panel. Select a tab to navigate to the session you want to work on. |
| 4 | Select a case to open a new session. A single click on a case replaces your view with the case form. Select the back arrow in the upper-left corner of the form to get back to your previous view.|
| 5 | Select the + icon to expand the menu to view a list of forms, views, and activities. Select the one you want to open in a new tab. |
| 6 | Select the tabs to navigate to your open activities, cases, forms and views. |
| 7 | Select the drop-down selector to filter cases in queues you can choose to work on. |
| 8 | Select Shift + mouse click to open a new session for an activity. A single click replaces your view with the activity form. Select the back arrow in the upper-left corner of the form to go back to your previous view. |
|||

## Navigate and view records

By default, you can use the following navigation options to open and view cases, accounts, and other details on the Customer Service Agent Dashboard:

- Select Shift + mouse click to open a new session tab for the record you want to open. 
- Selecting the record replaces your view with the form for the record you opened. 
- Select the back arrow in the upper-left corner of the form to get back to your previous view. 
- Select Ctrl + mouse click to open items in a new tab. 

However, the administrator can configure settings that allow for simpler navigation options that doesn't require agents to use complex keyboard selections. Perform the steps in the Simplify navigation in Customer Service workspace section to enable the settings. 

### Simplify navigation in Customer Service workspace

You can use the following utility to simplify navigation for agents when they work on cases in the Customer Service workspace app. The agents will be able to do the following actions:

- Select a case to open it in a session tab.
- Select a customer record of a case to open in an application tab.
- Select a customer record on the homepage to open it in a session tab.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have the System Administrator role to run the utility.

Perform the following steps to configure the navigation:

1. Sign into Dynamics 365.
2. Press the f12 key to open the developer tools.
3. Copy the following code and paste it in the **Console** tab of the developer tools to run the utility that manages app settings.

```
/**
* Utility to manage app settings
*/
class AppSettingUtility {
    static origin = Xrm.Utility.getGlobalContext().getClientUrl();
    static webApiUrl = `${this.origin}/api/data/v9.0/`;

    /**
     * Updates an app setting to the specified value
     * @param {*} setting the setting to update
     * @param {*} value value to set for the setting
     * @param {*} app (optional) if specified will update for individual app, if omitted then will update for all apps
     */
    static updateAppSetting(setting, value, app) {
        const data = {
            SettingName: setting,
            Value: value.toString(),
        };

        if (app !== undefined) {
            data.AppUniqueName = app;
        }

        // makes a call to SaveSettingValue to update an app setting
        console.log("Attempting update...");
        $.ajax({
            url: this.webApiUrl + "SaveSettingValue()",
            type: 'POST',
            contentType: 'application/json',
            headers: {
                'Accept': 'application/json',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
                'OData-MaxVersion': '4.0',
                'OData-Version': '4.0',
            },
            data: JSON.stringify(data),
            success: function () {
                // update was successful
                console.log(`The app setting '${setting}' was successfully updated to '${value}' for '${app !== undefined ? app : 'all app modules'}'`);
            },
            error: function (error) {
                // update failed
                console.log("An error occurred while trying to update the app setting. Please try again.");
                console.log(error);
            }
        });
    }
}

/**
* App module utility class
*/
class AppModuleUtility {
    static app;

    /**
     * Updates an app setting for the individual app module
     * @param {string} setting the setting to update
     * @param {*} value value to set for the setting
     */
    static updateAppSetting(setting, value) {
        AppSettingUtility.updateAppSetting(setting, value, this.app);
    }

    /**
     * Updates the multisession navigation improvements setting
     * @param {boolean} value value to set for the setting
     */
    static setMultisessionNavigationImprovementsSetting(value = true) {
        const setting = "msdyn_MultisessionNavigationImprovements";
        this.updateAppSetting(setting, value);
    }
}

/**
* App module utility for Customer Service workspace app
*/
class CSWAppUtility extends AppModuleUtility {
    static app = "msdyn_customerserviceworkspace";
}

/**
* App module utility for Omnichannel for Customer Service app
*/
class OCAppUtility extends AppModuleUtility {
    static app = "OmniChannelEngagementHub"; 
}
```
4. Run one of the following commands at the console to update the navigation settings.

   - **For Customer Service workspace:**

        CSWAppUtility.setMultisessionNavigationImprovementsSetting(); 

   - **For Omnichannel for Customer Service app:**

        OCAppUtility.setMultisessionNavigationImprovementsSetting();

   - **For both the multisession apps:**

        AppSettingUtility.updateAppSetting('msdyn_MultisessionNavigationImprovements', true);

    > [!NOTE]
    > To turn off the navigation setting, you can run one of the commands by using the "false" option.

5. Open Customer Service workspace and do one or more of the following actions on the Customer Service Agent Dashboard to explore the simplified navigation:
   - Select a case. The case record opens in a session tab.
   - Select the customer in the case. The customer record opens in a application tab.

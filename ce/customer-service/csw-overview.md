# Customer Service workspace - Overview

Welcome to the Customer Service workspace app module where we're increasing agent productivity for core customer service with the ability to work on multiple sessions at a time in a single workspace experience. And in the future should your business chose to expand your customer service offering to provide chat and channels, the Customer Service workspace seamlessly adjusts to support managing conversations as well (Early Release 09/01/2020). 

If you have used Customer Service Hub before, must of the Customer Service workspace app module functionaliy works in exactly the same way with some exceptions to accomodate the multisession and conversation capabilities. In this article we will walk through the Customer Service workspace experience and explain how to navigate. 

Before we dive in, a quick note about administration of Customer Service workspace. There is not currently a dedicated Administrator experience for Customer Service workspace. As such, configuring and managing core customer service capabilities, such as queues and routing rules,is done in the Service Manager experience in Customer Service Hub. Chat and channel configuration is done in Omnichannel Administration. Because all of these apps are on the Common Data Service (CDS), the data created through these experiences is accessible. 

# Introduction to Customer Service workspace
You can access Customer Service workspace through the app selector where you find all of your other Dynamics 365 apps by choosing the Customer Service workspace app tile. You can also access the app in the Dynamics 365 dropdown navigation in the upper left corner of Dynamics 365.

As an agent, when you open Customer Service workspace you start on the Customer Service Agent Dashboard. This dashboard shows you your active cases, cases you can work in queues you are assigned to, and your open activities. You can open existing cases and activities or begin working new cases from the queues you are assigned to and create new activities. 

Let's explore the elements of the Customer Service workspace and how to navigate between them: 
1. The session pane lists all of the sessions you are actively working on. Click on the tabs to navigate between sessions. 
2. The Home tab returns you to the Customer Service Agent Dashboard view. 
3. Each session has a tab in the session panel. Select a tab to navigate to the session you want to work on. 
4. Hold shift + click to open a new session for a case. A single click on a case replaces your view with the case form. Click the back arrow in the upper left corner of the form to get back to your previous view.
5. Choose the dropdown selector to filter cases in queues you can choose to work on. 
6. Click on the tabs to navigate to your open activities, cases, forms and views. 
7. Click the + icon to expand the menu to view a list of forms, views, and activities. Select the one you want to open in a new tab. 
8. Hold shift + click to open a new session for an activity. A single click replaces your view with the activity form. Click the back arrow in the upper left corner of the form to get back to your previous view.

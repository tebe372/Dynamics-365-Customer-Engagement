# Best practices to set up unified routing in Customer Service

This article lists some of the best practices to help set up and use unified routing optimally for your business.

## How to set up users in bulk

**Scenario**
I want to set up users in bulk in unified routing and configure settings such as profiles, capacity, and skills.

**Recommendation**
To configure a large number of users, do the following:

1. Enable users in batches of 500 each every 15 minutes.
1. Provide required roles to the users after you attach skills and grant queue membershipâ€‹ (since in this case it means 1 request per user to create Agent Availability collection).
 Adding 10 skills to 1 user after required roles are already provided, would mean 10 different requests. So, you should enable users in batches of 50 every 15 minutes in this case.

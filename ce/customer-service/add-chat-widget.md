# Add a chat widget

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

You can configure a live chat widget that can be displayed on your portal for customers to interact with bots and human agents.

To add a chat widget, you need to have configured a workstream that defines how chat conversations are routed to queues. More information: [Create a workstream](create-workstreams.md).

## Configure a chat widget

**To configure the chat widget**

1. In Dynamics 365, go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.
   
   ### [Customer Service admin center (preview)](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)

    1. In the site map, select **Channels** in **Customer support**. The **Channels** page appears.
    
    1. Select **Manage** for **Chat**. The **Chat channels** page appears.

### Configure customer notifications

You can configure visual and sound notifications to be sent to customers when they're interacting with agents through the chat widget on your organization portal.

You can also configure the customer notifications when you're configuring the chat channel.

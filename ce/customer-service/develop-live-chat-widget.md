# Develop a custom live chat widget

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Microsoft provides an option to create a custom live chat widget that you can attach to your Dynamics 365 Customer Service account. Each individual component of the custom live chat widget can be customized for both functionality and user interface. We recommend that you develop your own chat widget using the Omnichannel Live Chat Widget UI Components library and Omnichannel Chat SDK, as described in this article.

## Omnichannel Live Chat Widget UI Components

The Omnichannel Live Chat Widget UI Components library provides a framework of reusable React components that can be edited in all basic CSS styles to modify the user interface of the live chat widget. These components are built using the [Fluent UI library](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui).

To learn more about the Omnichannel Live Chat Widget UI Components, see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/omnichannel-chat-widget/blob/main/README.md).

## Omnichannel Chat SDK

The Omnichannel Chat SDK is an open-source package that provides chat methods and features to add functionality of the widget.

To learn more about the Omnichannel Chat SDK, see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/omnichannel-chat-sdk/blob/main/README.md).

## Customize your live chat widget

After you install the Omnichannel Chat SDK, you can customize your live chat widget using both the Omnichannel Live Chat Widget UI Components and the Omnichannel Chat SDK methods.

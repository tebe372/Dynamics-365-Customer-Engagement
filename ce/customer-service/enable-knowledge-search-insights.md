# Configure Knowledge search insights for Dynamics 365 Customer Service

The knowledge search analytics dashboard is designed to provide your organization's customer service supervisors and knowledge workers with valuable insights into how your support agents are finding and using knowledge articles. 

> [!NOTE]
> Knowledge search analytics will not provide information about customer search behavior. Data is only from internal knowledge searches.

## Configure the Knowledge search analytics dashboard

You can enable the knowledge search analytics dashboard in the Customer Service admin center (preview) or Customer Service Hub app.

**Enable the Knowledge search analytics dashboard**

1. Go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.
   
   ### [Customer Service admin center (preview)](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)
     
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > The Customer Service admin center app is in preview. [!INCLUDE[cc-preview-features-definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

     1. In the site map, select **Insights** in **Operations**. The **Insights** page appears.
     1. In the **Knowledge search analytics** section, select **Manage**.

     The **Knowledge search analytics** page is displayed.       

   ### [Customer Service Hub](#tab/customerservicehub)

2. Set the **Enable knowledge search analytics report** toggle to **On**.

3. Select **Save** or **Save & Close**.

### View Customer Service knowledge search analytics reports

The service managers must have the System Administrator, Knowledge Manager, or CSR Manager role to view the reports.

You can see the reports by navigating to the **Service** > **Insights** > **Knowledge search analytics** page. Search term insights are displayed.

### Provide report access to additional security roles

If your organization needs to enable users with different privileges to access reports in addition to the default ones, see [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles).

> [!NOTE]
> The knowledge base analytics dashboard supports only English content and is available only in organizations that have the base language set as English.

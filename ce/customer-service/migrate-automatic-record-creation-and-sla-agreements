# Migrate Automatic Record Creation and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

[Public Preview]

The Customer Service Hub app has several features and functionality that replace the items in the legacy Customer Service app. The rules for automatic record creation and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are now supported by Power Automate based flows to make the transition to the new platform easier to manage.

The following topic provides an overview on the migration tool that allows legacy rules for automatic record creation and SLAs to be transferred to Customer Service Hub app for easier access.

Based on feedback, we have made a number of improvements to the migration tool. The tool is designed to provide a seamless experience from workflows to Power Automate based flows that are created for the existing legacy rules for automatic record creation and SLAs that provide Admin with the ability to plan your migration and:
- Choose which legacy rules need to be migrated with the ability to activate rules post migration.
- Decide when to switch to the new rule (legacy rules are not modified).
- Flexibility to decide when to activate new rules and deactivate the legacy rules so you are not forced to activate all or none. 
- Ability to run the migration tool multiple times and see what your status looks like at any point in time.
- Receive error insights with recommended resolution steps.

NOTE: Legacy rules continue to run on existing cases until the rules are deactivated.

# Set up Omnichannel for Customer Service channels in Customer Service workspace

When your agents are working on cases, there may be times when you want them to also be able to have conversations with customers. Using Omnichannel for Customer Service add-on licensing, you can set up your Customer Service workspace environment so that agents are able to work on both cases and conversations without having to leave the Customer Service workspace app.

## Enable channel conversations in Customer Service workspace 

To enable agents to be able to have conversations in Customer Service workspace, do the following: 

1. Obtain Omnichannel for Customer Service add-on licenses and set up your Omnichannel environment. More information: [Provision Omnichannel](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/omnichannel-provision-license). 

2. Configure the following in the Omnichannel Administrator app: 

    a. [Channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/channels)
    
    b. [Queues and users](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/queues-omnichannel)
    
    c. [Work streams](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/work-streams-introduction)
    
3. Assign the Omnichannel Agent and/or Omnichannel Supervisor roles to your users. More information: [Assign roles and enable users for Omnichannel for Customer Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/add-users-assign-roles)

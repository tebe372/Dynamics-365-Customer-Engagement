# Overview of user management 

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

To begin using Customer Service Hub, Customer Service workspace, and Omnichannel for Customer Service, each member of your organization will need a user account.

You'll use the Microsoft 365 admin center to create user accounts. The user account registers the user with Microsoft Online Services environment. In addition to registration with the online service, you must assign a license to the user account for the user to have access to the service.

When you assign a user the global administrator or the service administrator role in the Microsoft Online Services environment, it automatically assigns the user the System Administrator security role.

The topics in this section explain how to use the Microsoft 365 admin center to create security roles for users, and then how to use advanced settings in Omnichannel for Customer Service to create user roles to perform specific actions in the app.

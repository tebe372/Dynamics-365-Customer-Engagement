This new voice channel for Customer Service enables an all-in-one customer service solution without fragmentation or manual data integration required, and a faster time to value. Our solution provides a single view of the customer that empowers agents to provide personalized service across all channels, and true omnichannel analytics and insights for agents and supervisors alike.


**Together with all channels**

Typically, customer service organizations must manually integrate standalone telephony and CRM solutions, which result in fragmented experiences for agents and customers across engagement channels. Ultimately, these stitched-together solutions from multiple providers are not only complex to roll out and maintain but create data silos with disconnected insights of customer interactions and agent performance across channels. The addition of the voice channel enables Customer Service to offer businesses a solution that minimizes failure points caused by custom-built, complex integrations, and maximizes the ability to create better customer and agent experiences. This single, holistic solution also makes it easier to scale to meet changing business needs.

- Even with the rise of digital channels and self-service, telephony remains a critical channel for contact centers to provide customer support. Most CRM players lack native telephony and only support integrations with telephony providers, also known as CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service) players, through “at the glass” CTI (softphones) widgets. As telephony follows CRM to the cloud, customers are looking to simplify their combined solution. 
extending our current assets, such as Power Virtual Agent, Intelligent Routing and conversation canvas, we can offer a telephony solution directly within Dynamics OC.

Microsoft’s Omnichannel for Customer Service allows us to escalate web chat conversations to voice and video calls, this is a great feature when conversations become complex and a chat conversation is simply more long winded than a voice call.

ensuring consistent, personalized, and connected support across all channels of engagement

**Differentiating AI**

We should bring to bear the best demonstrations of real-time and historical voice intelligence from Microsoft. As more CRM companies follow this trend to integrate channels and voice, the use of the data to create insights will be a big differentiator. 

Leverage built-in AI to resolve issues faster with tools like call transcriptions and sentiment analysis 

Speech-based self-service: NLU-powered IVRs and speech-enabled virtual agents by connecting the telephony channel to Power Virtual Agent for intuitive self-service and seamless elevation to agent-service. PVA bots will be built once and deployed across messaging and voice channels alike.

## Agent experience using the Voice channel

Agents receive incoming voice calls the same way they receive other customer requests from channels like SMS and social media.

# Get started with Omnichannel admin center

[!INCLUDE[cc-oc-admin-csh-deprecation.md](../includes/cc-oc-admin-csh-deprecation.md)]

Omnichannel for Customer Service is a robust application that extends the power of Dynamics 365 Customer Service to enable organizations to instantly connect and engage with customers through channels, such as live chat, SMS, and WhatsApp. It provides a modernized design, with simplified and streamlined admin workflows that empower Omnichannel administrators to setup Omnichannel for Customer Service quickly with fewer efforts.

The Omnichannel admin center app lets you configure the channels, agents, and supervisor settings, and the corresponding features to use the channels for handling customer issues through conversations.

The app is automatically installed in all the Customer Service organizations that have Omnichannel for Customer Service provisioned. You can sign in to Dynamics 365, and on the apps page, select Omnichannel admin center.

If you are an upgrading user of Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can perform all the tasks in Omnichannel admin center that you'd been performing in the Omnichannel Administration app.

# Parse event activity JSON to get bot context

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The Omnichannel for Customer Service context messages are sent as event activity to bots. Context information such as customer info, live work item, or conversation ID, is sent to the bot as part of an activity JSON. The JSON can be of type **startConversation** for most channels and **ConversationUpdate** for voice conversations. 

## Fetch and use context for bots in your bot code

 To process these context messages, use activity handlers and override them in your bot code. For information on how to use activity handlers, see [Event-driven conversations using an activity handler](/azure/bot-service/bot-activity-handler-concept?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp&preserve-view=true).

In the following example, when the event activity is received, the `OnEventActivityAsync` method is called to fetch and use the context. 

```CSharp
protected override async Task OnEventActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IEventActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            if (turnContext.Activity.Name == "omnichannelSetContext")
           {
                // Replace with your logic to fetch the context from Activity.Value
                IActivity replyActivity = MessageFactory.Text($"Received context :  {turnContext.Activity.Value.ToString()}");

                // Replace with your logic to consume the context
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(replyActivity, cancellationToken);
            }
        }
```

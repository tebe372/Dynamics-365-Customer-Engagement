# Historical analytics for unified routing in Customer Service

## Introduction

With the introduction of Unified Routing, an advanced and elaborate set of capabilities are available for organizations to enhance their routing configurations. Business administrators and supervisors need metrics to track how these advanced routing capabilities are helping their businesses serve their customers.

In Customer Service, the report displays metrics pertaining to only those records that are routed using unified routing.

## Unified routing in Customer Service

The Unified routing report appears as a tab in the Customer Service historical analytics report if your administrator has enabled the corresponding setting on the **Insights** page in Customer Service Hub. You can access the report in Service. In the site map, select **Customer Service historical analytics**, and then select **Unified routing**.

The report can be filtered on the following:

- **Duration**: Filters the data by the selected value of day, week, or month.
- **Record type**: Displays data for the selected record.
- **Queue**: Displays data for the selected queue.
- **Time zone**: Displays data for the selected time zone.

The unified routing report displays the following metrics.

# Create email templates

Email templates are a fast and easy way to send repetitive and recurring email to multiple customers. They can help save you time and give you a way to create consistent, professional, preformatted email messages that you can use when communicating with your customers. You can view, create, and edit any email templates you've created.

When creating a template, you have the option to work with a blank or existing template.

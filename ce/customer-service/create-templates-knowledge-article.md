# Knowledge article templates

Knowledge article templates help knowledge authors simplify the process of creating knowledge articles. Templates also help knowledge managers and authors maintain consistency in branding, language, and structure. 

When an author chooses a template to create an article, certain fields in the template are pre-populated with values, allowing the author to focus on the main content of the article.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn how to use knowledge article templates to create knowledge articles, go to [Create knowledge articles using templates](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#create-knowledge-articles-using-templates).

## Prerequisites

Before working with templates, make sure you have the required privileges to create, edit, or delete knowledge article templates. Contact your administrator if you do not have these privileges.

## Create a knowledge article template

 As a knowledge manager, you can create knowledge article templates by defining the necessary fields such as Language, Title, Keywords, and Subject. These fields will be pre-populated when the author creates the article using the template, reducing the efforts to fill in these fields. 

1.	Open the **Customer Service Hub** app and select **Change area** > **Service Management**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select Service Management.](media/ka-select-service-management.png "Select Service Management")

2.	Under **Knowledge Base Management**, select **Article Templates**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select Article Templates.](media/ka-select-article-template.png "Select Article Templates")

3.	To create a template, select **New**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select New.](media/ka-select-new.png "Select New")
 
4.	In the **Choose Language** dialog box, select the language for the template, and then select **OK**. In this example, we are selecting the language as **English – United States**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Choose language.](media/ka-choose-language.png "Choose language")
 
5.	On the **New Knowledge Article Template** page, enter the values for the required fields that you want to pre-populate when the template is selected. 

    |Section|Field|Description|
    |-------|-----|-----------|
    | **TEMPLATE DATA** | Name | Enter a name for the template. |
    || Owner | Enter the name of the owner who owns the template. By default, your name will be displayed in this field. | 
    | **ARTICLE DATA** | `--` | Define article fields such as Title, Keywords, and Subject that are used in any knowledge article that’s created based on the template. |
    | **CONTENT** | `--` | Define a structure that will be used in any knowledge article that’s created based on this template. To learn more, see [Use the rich text editor to create knowledge articles and emails](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#use-the-rich-text-editor-to-create-knowledge-articles-and-emails). |

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Enter the values in new knowledge article template.](media/ka-new-template-page.png "Enter the values in new knowledge article template")

6.	After you have entered the required information, select **Save**.

    A template is created and is available for knowledge authors to use to create articles.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Similarly, you can edit or delete knowledge article templates from the **Service Management** area. 

## Use a template in Portal Knowledge Article Interactive Experience forms and custom forms

To add a knowledge article template to your forms, perform the following steps:

1. In Dynamics 365, go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings** > **Customizations**.

2. Select **Knowledge Article Entity**, and then select **Forms**.

3. Open **Portal Knowledge Article Interactive Experience form**, and then select **Form Properties**.

4. Select **Add** to add the knowledge article template library that has the following web resource:

```
msdyncrm_/KnowledgeManagementFeatureWebResource/KnowledgeArticleTemplate/KnowledgeArticleTemplateMainSystemLibrary.js
```

5. Under **Event Handlers**, make sure that the **Event** field is set to **Onload**.

6. Select **Add**. Ensure that the **Library** field is populated with the same web resource that you have added.

7. In the **Function** field, add the following function:

```
KnowledgeManagement.CommandBarActions.Instance.knowledgeArticle_onload
```

8. Ensure that the **Enabled** box is selected.

9. Select the **Pass execution context as first parameter** box, and then select **OK**.

10. Select **Save**, and then select **Publish**.

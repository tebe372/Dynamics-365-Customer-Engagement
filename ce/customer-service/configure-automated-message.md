# Configure automated messages

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

You can configure Omnichannel for Customer Service to send automated messages through chat, SMS, Microsoft Teams, or social channels. The **Automated messages** tab in each channel instance enables administrators to create channel-specific, locale-specific text. Administrators can customize, deactivate, and activate channel-level customer and agent-facing messages.  

## Display a list of all automated messages

You can view a list of all agent and customer-facing automated messages in your Omnichannel for Customer Service environment. Administrators can overwrite or deactivate the preconfigured, out-of-the-box automated messages for any channel instance. See [Preconfigured automated message triggers](#preconfigured-automated-message-triggers) for more information.

You can configure automated messages in the Customer Service admin center (preview) or Omnichannel admin center apps.

1. Go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.
   
   ### [Customer Service admin center (preview)](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)
     
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > The Customer Service admin center app is in preview. [!INCLUDE[cc-preview-features-definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

     1. In the site map, select **Customer Settings** in **Customer support**. The **Customer settings** page appears.
     1. In the **Automated messages** section, select **Manage**.

     The **Automated messages** page is displayed.      

   ### [Omnichannel admin center](#tab/omnichanneladmincenter)
    
     1. In the site map, select **Customer Settings** in **Advanced settings**. The **Customer settings** page appears.
     2. In the **Automated messages** section, select **Manage**.

      The **Automated messages** page is displayed.

    > ![Display all automated messages.](media/automated-messages-list.png "Display all automated messages")

2. Select one or more of the records to edit the language code and text. If you want to deactivate the messages, select the **Deactivate** button.

## Customize automated messages at the channel level

You can customize messages across instances within a channel. For example, you can apply a change to all Facebook accounts or all SMS numbers.

1. Select a message in the Automated messages list.

2. Edit the message text, and select **Save**.

    The message field supports the following slugs.
    
    | **Slug** | **Description** |
    |----------|-----------------|
    |{AgentName} | The full name of the agent who is assigned to the conversation |
    |{QueueName} | The name of the queue |

    > ![Configure automated messages at channel level.](media/automated-messages-general.png "Configure automated messages at channel level")

## Customize automated messages at the channel instance level

You can customize automated messages at the channel instance level. For example, you can apply a change to one specific Facebook account, one specific SMS number, and so on. If you don't create customized automated messages at the channel instance level, each instance will inherit the channel-level settings. If you create customized automated messages at the channel instance level, the channel-level settings are overwritten.

### Add custom automated messages

Do the following for the channel in which you want to create custom automated messages in the Customer Service admin center (preview) or Omnichannel admin center app:

1. Go to the workstream, and edit the channel instance.
2. On the **Behaviors** page, select **Add message** in the **Custom automated messages** area.
3. On the **Add automated message** pane, select a trigger in the **Message trigger** list.
4. In the **Automated message** box, type the message that should be displayed.
5. Select **Confirm**.
6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 to create multiple messages.
7. Save the settings.

### Add custom automated messages in Omnichannel Administration

1. In Omnichannel Administration, go to **Channels**, and select the channel you will use to send automated messages. This example uses WeChat.
2. In the list of accounts, open the channel instance for which you want to configure an automated message.
3. Select the **Automated messages** tab, and select **New message**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Configure automated messages.](media/automated-messages.png "Configure automated messages")

4. Enter the name of your message, select the message trigger, and then type your message. The **Language Code** field is determined by the language set in the **General settings** tab of the channel instance and cannot be modified. The **Message Trigger** field contains the system events that prompt an automated message to be sent.
12. Select **Save**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Create automated messages.](media/automated-messages-create.png "Create automated messages")
    
    The message is added to the list of channel instance-specific messages. To create localized versions of the message, repeat the steps for each language required. 

To deactivate messages at the channel instance level, select one or more messages, and select the **Deactivate** button.

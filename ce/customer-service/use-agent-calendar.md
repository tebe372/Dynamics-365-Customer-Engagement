# View the agent calendar (preview)

As an agent, it's helpful to know your work schedule. If your administrator has enabled the calendar view, you can quickly see your working hours, non-working hours, and any time-off you've scheduled. The calendar view is read-only and includes daily, weekly, and monthly view options.

1. In Customer Service workspace, select the **Customer Service Agent Dashboard** page from the **System Dashboards** dropdown menu.

1. In the site map, select the plus (+) icon, and then select **My schedule** from the dropdown menu.

   The **My schedule** page opens with a read-only calendar view of the working hours, non-working hours, and any time off you have scheduled. Use the command bar at the top to change the view to daily, weekly, or monthly.

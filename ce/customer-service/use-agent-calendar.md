# View the agent calendar

As an agent, it's helpful to know your work schedule, breaks, trainings, and other activities. If your administrator has enabled the calendar view, you can quickly see your work hours, nonwork hours, and any time off that you've scheduled.

The calendar view is read-only and has daily, weekly, and monthly views. It also has an agenda view where you can see a list-type view of your schedule.

1. In Customer Service workspace, expand the left-side sitemap, and then select **My Schedule**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/my-schedule-calendar.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sitemap with the calendar option selected.":::

   The **My Schedule** page opens with a read-only calendar view of the work hours, nonwork hours, and any time off you've scheduled. Work hours are displayed in blue, and nonwork hours are displayed in gray.

2. (Optional) Use the top-right menu to change the view to agenda, daily, weekly, or monthly.

You can grant your supervisors permissions to monitor, assign, and transfer conversations by enabling the respective permissions in Omnichannel Administration **Supervisor Settings**.

- To enable your supervisors to monitor how conversations are being handled by their agents, go to **Supervisor settings** and set the **Supervisor Monitor** toggle to **Yes**. More info: [Monitor, assign, and transfer conversations](monitor-conversations.md#monitor-and-join-conversations).

- To enable supervisors to assign conversations, go to **Supervisor settings** and set the **Supervisor Assign** toggle to **Yes**. More info: [Monitor, assign, and transfer conversations](monitor-conversations.md#assign-conversations).

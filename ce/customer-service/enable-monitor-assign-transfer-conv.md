# Enable your supervisors to monitor, assign, and transfer conversations

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

As an administrator, you can enable your supervisors to take specific actions on various conversations being handled by their agents in Omnichannel for Customer Service. You can grant your supervisors permissions to monitor, assign, and transfer conversations by enabling the respective permissions in the Omnichannel admin center or Omnichannel Administration apps.

1. In the site map of Omnichannel admin center app, select **Supervisor settings**, and then **Manage** for **Ongoing Conversation Insights**. If you're using the Omnichannel Administration app, select **Ongoing Conversations Dashboard** under **Supervisor Experience**.
A list of existing supervisor settings is displayed.

2. Enable the relevant supervisor setting as follows:
    - To enable supervisors to monitor how conversations are happening or being handled by their agents, set the **Supervisor Monitor** toggle to **Yes**. 

    - To enable supervisors to assign conversations to agents, set the **Supervisor Assign** toggle to **Yes**. 

    - To enable supervisors to transfer conversations from one agent to another, set the **Supervisor Transfer** toggle to **Yes**. 

3. To disable any of the settings, set its corresponding toggle to **No**.

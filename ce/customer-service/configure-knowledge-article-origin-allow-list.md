# Configure origins allowlist for knowledge articles

You can configure an origins allowlist to ensure that knowledge authors add only safe links to their knowledge articles.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The supported origins are HTTP or HTTPS protocol, IP address or domain name, and TCP port number. For example, https://www.contoso.com, https://www.contoso.com:443 are supported origins. Knowledge authors must use only links with origin links as specified in the supported origins list.

After you've enabled this feature while creating knowledge articles, if knowledge authors add links whose origin links don't match any of the links specified in the origins list, an error message will be displayed for links that are hosted within an iframe. For example, if you add https://www.contoso.com in the origins list, knowledge authors can use https://www.contoso.com/about or https://www.contoso.com/overview. But if they use https://contoso.com/about or https://contoso.com/overview in the articles, the links will be broken and an error message will be displayed. Also, in the **Content** field on the knowledge article form, knowledge authors will see the following message: "Update your origins allowlist if any iframe in the article doesn't work or displays error."

For published articles, agents and portal users will see an error message in the article for the links that are hosted within an iframe. In such cases, you must update the origins list, so that all the existing iframe links will continue to work.

# Create and manage subjects in a subject tree

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] includes a subject organizational structure that lets you mark and categorize service cases, knowledge base articles, and products. By using the subject hierarchy, you can classify service cases to quickly provide service to your customer.
  
## Create or edit a subject  
  
1. In the Customer Service Hub sitemap, go to **Service Management** > **Subjects**.  
  
2.  To add a subject, click **Add Subject**.  
  
     -OR-  
  
     To edit a subject, in the subject tree, select a subject, and then  select **Edit Subject**.  
  
3.  In the **Subject** dialog box, enter the required information:  
  
    - **Title**: Type a name for the subject. This is a required field.  
  
    - **Parent Subject**: To search for and select a parent subject for the new subject, click the **Lookup** button.  
  
         -OR-  
  
         To make the new subject a parent subject, select the **Parent Subject** box.  
  
    - **Description**: Type a descriptive statement about the subject.  
  
4.  Click **Save**.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you select a subject in the subject tree and select **Add Subject**, select the **Parent Subject** box to make it a parent subject. If you do not select the box, the new subject will be added as a child of that subject.
  
## Remove a subject  

To remove a subject from the subject tree, select the subject and select **Remove Subject**.

  > ![Navigate Records](media/v9-navigate-records.png "Navigate Records")

When you select a record type from the menu, such as Accounts, Contacts, or Cases, you'll see a list of corresponding customer records (also known as Entity grid).

To view recently opened records, select the down-arrow next to the record type in the site map.

Here is what each entity record type is used for:

  - **Dashboards** collect all your most important data in one place. You can select from multiple dashboards as per your role.
  - **Activities** help you keep track of tasks, email messages, appointments, phone calls and much more.
  - **Accounts** are the companies you do business with.
  - **Contacts** help you manage and store information about the customers you work with.
  - **Social Profiles** let you track a contact's presence in social media.
  - **Cases** help you create and track your customer requests and issues.
  - **Queues** keep a track of cases waiting for you to work on.
  - **Knowledge Articles** capture your customer's questions, issues, feedback, and resolutions, so that other service reps can benefit from them.


2. Select **...** to go to **Training**, and access the documentation site to view the **Help Center**. 

3. You can also access **Service Management** from the site map. Service Management lets you define all the customer service admin settings from the Customer Service Hub site map.  Select **...** to go to **Service Management**.

## Quickly create new records
  
- To create records quickly by filling in only the most basic information, select the **New** button ![Create button](../customer-service/media/quick-create-button.png "Create button") given on the nav bar.

  > [!TIP]
  > On a mobile device, from the nav bar, tap ![Tap the ellipsis](media/ellipsis.png "Tap the ellipsis") and then tap **Quick Create Menu**.

## Email a link

You can email links to records so your colleagues can quickly find these records by selecting the links. To email links to records, select one or more records in the list, and then on the command bar, select **Email a link**. The default email client opens with the links to these records. The recipients will see all content in the records for which they have permission.  

## Know your forms

Forms are designed to help you quickly handle important customer service tasks and complete actions from a single place.

The different components of a form are explained in the following sections.
  
### Business processes

In the Customer Service Hub, forms for cases and knowledge articles include a process bar (also called a business process flow), which appears when you save the record for the first time.

When you select a process stage on the process bar, you'll see the steps to take to complete that stage. A flag on a stage indicates the stage you're currently on. When you select an active stage, you can see the **Next Stage** button move to the next stage in the process.  

The stages in the business process flow are displayed in floating mode, or docked mode. Stages can  be aligned in a vertical layout, instead of horizontal, which makes it easier to see what steps are required to move forward. You can also choose to include an optional step in the business process flow and define criteria to trigger it.

![Business process flows](media/business-process-flow.png "Business process flows")
  
If there is more than one process to follow, you can switch between them by selecting **Process** > **Switch Process** on the command bar, and then selecting the process you want to use.  Or you can choose to abandon the process if it no longer applies.
  
 When a business process flow based on multiple entities is applied to a case or a knowledge article, the following limitations apply:  
  
- The business process flow based on multiple entities isn't displayed on the form.  
  
- The **Switch Process** option only shows business process flows that are based on a single entity.  
  
- If there are only multi-entity business process flows for an entity, the **Switch Process** option isn't available.  

### Tabs on the form

Each case form is composed of one or more tabs. By default, the **Summary** tab shows information about the customer, interactions with the customer, and other related records. You can select different tabs to enter or see other miscellaneous details of a record.  
  
For example, here's a view of how the tabs appear on the case form:
  
![case-form-tabs](media/v9-case-form-tabs.png "Case form tabs")
  
 This table lists the default tabs for each record type and the information that they show for a particular record.  
  
|Record type|Default tabs|  
|-----------------|------------------|  
|Case|**Summary**. Includes the customer card, Timeline, and the Related section.<br />   **Details**. Tracks Case details, additional details, and social response details of the case. <br />**Case Relationships**. Shows merged cases, child cases, and associated knowledge articles. You can add a child case to the current case from the Child Cases list. It also shows a list of knowledge articles associated with the case.<br />**SLA**.

Shows related common entities.|  
|Social Profiles|**Social Profile**. Captures general information, and social profile details along with related social profiles.<br />**Related**. Shows related common entities.|  

### Contact card

See a complete view of your customer's touch points in the Contact card. This card is available in the **General Information** section of the **Summary** tab.  
  
![Contact card](media/contact-card.png "Contact card")

You can add a picture to the account or contact record in the Dataverse platform, and it will appear on this card. You can make calls to customers from the Contact card using Skype for Business – IP telephony.
  
For account records, the card shows contact details for the primary contact associated with the account. For contact records, the card appears if the contact is the customer value on the case form.  

## Work with Queues

Use queues to organize, prioritize, and monitor the progress of your work. In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, queues are containers used to store anything that needs to be completed or requires an action, for example completing a task or closing a case. To know more about creating and managing queues, see [Create and manage queues](set-up-queues-manage-activities-cases.md).

![Work with queues](media/queues-view.png "Queues view")


To know how to add a case to a queue, see [Add a case to a queue](customer-service-hub-user-guide-case-queues-and-routing.md).

## Understand Site

To create a new site, you need to go to **Advanced find** ![Advanced find](media/advanced-find-icon.png "Advanced find").  Then you can customize other entity forms (e.g. Account) by adding this site field.

  ![Create New Site](media/add-site-to-any-entity-1a.png "Create New Site")
 
## Understand Facility/Equipment

 To create a new Facility/Equipment item, you need to go to **Advanced find** ![Advanced find](media/advanced-find-icon.png "Advanced find"), where you can create Facility/Equipment.

  ![Create New Facility/Equipment](media/add-site-to-any-entity-1b.png "Create New Facility/Equipment")

### Related section

In the **Related** section (also known as Reference panel), use the tabs to see related records for the current record. This section is enabled by default for account, contact, case, and knowledge article records. Your customizer can add this section for all entities (including custom entities) that are enabled for interactive experience. The reference panel is also available in model-driven apps, for information, see [Reference Panel in model-driven apps ](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/navigation#reference-panel).

By default, the first tab in the Related section of a case record shows the **Recent Cases and Entitlements** for the current case record you're working on. 
  
![Reference panel](media/reference-panel.png "Reference panel")

The second tab in the Related section of a case record is the **Knowledge Base search**. Knowledge Base search lets you search for the knowledge articles related to a specific record. It also lets you view automatic suggestions. You can filter the search results to display articles that are Published, Draft, or Approved. For more information, see [Search for Knowledge articles](search-knowledge-articles-csh.md). 
  

The third tab in the Related section of a case record displays **Similar Cases**. Select **...** on a record to follow or unfollow the case, and explore other options. 

![Similar cases](media/similar-cases.png "Similar cases in Reference panel")

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure rules that help you view similar cases based on automatic suggestions. For more information, see [Use advanced similarity rules to view similar case suggestions](suggest-similar-cases-for-a-case.md).

Similarly,

- For **Accounts** records, you can view **Contacts**, **Recent Opportunities**, **Recent Cases**, and **Entitlements** in the Related section.
- For **Contacts** records, the Related section displays **Recent Opportunities**, **Recent Cases**, and **Entitlements**. 
- For **Knowledge articles** records, select an article and go to the **Summary** tab to view the **Related Information** panel. Here you can view **Related versions**, **Related translations**, **Related categories**, **Related articles**, and **Related products** for an article.

> [!NOTE]
> Your system administrator or customizer can choose if Related section should be included in a form. They can also decide on what related data should be displayed in the section for each form.


#### Reference Panel reflow

The Customer Service Hub is available to use on a desktop browser, and on a mobile device. Depending on the zoom level and the resolution of the system on which you are accessing the hub interface, the Reference panel adjusts the tabs and records for an optimum experience.

For example, on a browser, if you zoom in to about 100% or more, the tabs get docked on the top of the panel.

![reference-panel-zoomin](media/rp-zoomin.png "Reference panel reflow")

Similarly, if you zoom out to about 60-70%, the records appear in grid form.

![reference-panel-zoomout](media/rp-grid-zoomout.png "Reference panel reflow")

## Understand Activities

Activities are the tasks that you or your team perform while interacting with customers. An activity is any action which can be entered on a calendar and has time dimensions (start time, stop time, due date, and duration) that help determine when the action occurred or is planned to occur.

For example, you can make a record to track a phone call with a customer, or list an appointment scheduled with a customer to discuss a certain issue. You can create activities for yourself, or assign them to other service reps.

In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, the following activities are supported:
- Email
- Task
- Appointment
- Phone Call
- Social Activity

> [!NOTE]
> You can create and edit emails in the Customer Service Hub app on a desktop browser. However, on a mobile device email is read-only in the Hub app.

#### Open Activities view

In the Customer Service Hub site map, select **Service** > **Activities**. The **My Activities** view is displayed. 

![activities-email](media/activities-csh-email.png "Activities view")

- Select ![quick-create-activity](media/quick-create-button.png) in the nav bar to go to **Activities** to quickly add a new activity.

- Select the **My Activities** drop-down to switch between activity views.

- Select the  **Due** drop-down to see the list of activities that are due in coming time or are already overdue.

- Explore the command bar options to create a new activity like new **Task**, **Email**, **Appointment**, or **Phone call**.
  
  For example: To create a new email, select **Email** from the command bar.  The New Email activity form is displayed.
  
- Select **...** in the command bar and go to **Open Dashboards** to directly open activity dashboard.

- To view the status of an activity, click the activity record and see bottom-left in the activity form.

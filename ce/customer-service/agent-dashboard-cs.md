> - A preview is a feature that is not complete, as it may employ reduced privacy, security, and/or compliance commitments, but is made available before it is officially released for general availability so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Previews are provided "as-is," "with all faults," "as available," and without warranty.
> - This preview feature does not come with technical support and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won't be able to help you with issues or questions.  If Microsoft does elect to provide any type of support, such support is provided "as is," "with all faults," and without warranty, and may be discontinued at any time.
> - Previews are not meant for production use, especially to process Personal Data or other data that is subject to heightened compliance requirements, and any use of "live" or production data is at your sole risk. All previews are subject to separate [Terms and Conditions](../legal/supp-dynamics365-preview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is intended to help customer service managers or supervisors enhance their team's performance and improve customer satisfaction. This feature is not intended for use in making, and should not be used to make, decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365 Customer Service, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring, recording, and storing communications with end users. This also includes adequately notifying end users that their communications with agents may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their agents that their communications with end users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.

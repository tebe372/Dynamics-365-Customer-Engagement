# Create bookmarks to access personalized reports

The Microsoft Power BI bookmarks feature can be used to create and save custom views of the reports as bookmarks in Customer Service workspace or Omnichannel for Customer Service. The bookmarks will help you save multiple bookmarks, set a default bookmarks, and select any of the saved bookmarks to view the reports based on the context.

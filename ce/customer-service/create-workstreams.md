# Create workstreams

A workstream is a collection of routing and work distribution settings. Routing settings define how conversations should be routed to queues. Work distribution settings define how conversations should be allocated to agents within a queue.


Perform the following steps to configure the workstream:
1.	In the Omnichannel admin center app, go to the home page.
2.	On the left pane, select **Workstreams**, select **New**, and then select **Create a workstream**.
3.	Enter the following details for the workstream:
    - **Name:** Enter an intuitive name, such as **Contoso chat workstream**.
    - **Work distribution mode:** Select **Push** or **Pick**.
    - **Type:** Select Messaging.
    - **Channel:** Select a channel from the list.

4.	Select **Create**. The workstream that you created is displayed.

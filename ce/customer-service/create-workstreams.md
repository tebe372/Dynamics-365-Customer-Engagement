# Create work streams

A work stream is a collection of routing and work distribution settings. Routing settings define how conversations should be routed to queues. Work distribution settings define how conversations should be allocated to agents within a queue.


Perform the following steps to configure a work stream for live chat:
1.	In the Omnichannel admin center (preview) app, go to the home page.
2.	On the left pane, select Work streams, and then select Create a work stream.
3.	Enter the following details for the work stream:
    - Name: An intuitive name, such as Contoso chat work stream.
    - Work distribution mode: Select Push or Pick.
    - Type: Select Messaging.
Note: By default, Owner and Channel are predefined and unavailable for selection in the private preview release.
4.	Select Create. The work stream that you created is displayed.

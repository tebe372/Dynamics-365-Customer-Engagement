## Introduction

If your administrator has enabled the AI-suggested similar cases and knowledge articles, you can view the similarly resolved cases and knowledge articles that are displayed on the Smart assist pane when you open an active case.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Smart assist** pane is displayed only when you open the case in a new session tab by using the Shift+mouse click action. If you open to view a resolved case in an app tab when your in-progress case is open, smart assist will not be refreshed for the resolved case.

## Prerequisites

- AI-suggestions for similar cases and knowledge articles should be enabled by your administrator.
- Smart assist feature must be enabled by your administrator. More information: [Smart assist in Customer Service Workspace](csw-productivity-pane.md#smart-assist)
- The Productivity tools user role must be assigned to you.

## Understand the knowledge article components in Smart assist

When you open an active case to work on it, up to three top knowledge articles that match the case context are displayed in the **Smart assist** pane.

When you open an active case to work on it, up to top three resolved cases that you have access to are suggested by the AI model and displayed in the **Smart assist** pane. By default, the suggestions are made based on case title and description. Your administrator may change the settings to use other text fields for the AI model to get the case context.

# Topics dashboard

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Topics dashboard shows a detailed breakdown of cases and their assigned topics. Customer Service Insights uses AI-generated topics and natural language understanding to automatically group your cases to help you better understand how different case types and topic areas are impacting your organization’s support performance.

### Case topics drill down view

The case topics drill down view provides supervisors with a holistic look into individual topics in reference to key business metrics and can be valuable in understanding why end customers are contacting support. 

To access the case topics drill down, select any metric value for the required topic and select **Details**.

### Enable availability of topics for Power Virtual Agents bots

AI-discovered topics in Customer Service historical analytics are often prime candidates as topics for automation in Power Virtual Agents bots. If Power Virtual Agents bot is available in the region in which your Customer Service organization is located, the feature can be enabled by the administrator for use.

> ![Automate topics to Power Virtual Agents](media/automate-topics-to-PVA.png "Automate topics to Power Virtual Agents")

After a topic is identified as a good automation candidate, the automation workflow can be triggered by selecting **Power virtual agents** on the **Topic metrics** grid. Select **Details** and then select **Automate to bot** within the drill down view. This will launch the topic editing form.  

The suggested trigger phases as well as the topic based on the case title is provided. The first step is to select the Power Virtual Agents bot that is ideal for adding the topic to. If no bot exists, selecting **Create Bot** will redirect to the Power Virtual Agents application for bot creation. Both the topic name and trigger phrases can be modified, and in the case of trigger phrases, additional ones can be added.

> [!NOTE]
> Any bots created through the Microsoft Teams channel will not be listed in the bot selection list. Users who create bots by using the drill down page for a topic in Customer Service workspace will be redirected to Customer Service Hub for form completion.

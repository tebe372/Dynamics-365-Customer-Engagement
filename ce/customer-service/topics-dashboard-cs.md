> - A preview is a feature that is not complete, as it may employ reduced privacy, security, and/or compliance commitments, but is made available before it is officially released for general availability so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Previews are provided "as-is," "with all faults," "as available," and without warranty.
> - This preview feature does not come with technical support and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won't be able to help you with issues or questions.  If Microsoft does elect to provide any type of support, such support is provided "as is," "with all faults," and without warranty, and may be discontinued at any time.

All previews are subject to separate [Terms and Conditions](../legal/supp-dynamics365-preview.md).

The Topics dashboard shows a detailed breakdown of cases and their assigned topics. Customer Service Insights uses AI-generated topics and natural language understanding to automatically group your cases to help you better understand how different case types and topic areas are impacting your organization’s support performance.

# Use Timeline

Timeline is a control that allows you to view different activity types that are connected to an entity record and occur over time in a single stream. Some activities that can be logged in the timeline are notes, phone calls, emails, appointments, and tasks.

Timeline allows you to:

- Quickly access on the command bar to perform common actions with ease.
- Filter and view your important activities using multiple filter options.
- View and manage email conversation threads with ease.

## How to use timeline functionality

The following is an overview of how the timeline functionality works in each section on the entity form. The timeline section on the entity form is rich in features and functionality to help you navigate and streamline efforts.

The icons displayed in the top right nav in the Timeline give quick access to the following capabilities, when enabled by your system administrator:

- [Create a timeline record](#create-a-timeline-record)
- [Work with Filters](#work-with-filters)
- [Work with Records](#work-with-records)
- [Explore more commands](#more-commands)
- [Search Records](#search-records-on-timeline)
- [Add attachments](#add-an-attachment-to-a-note-in-timeline) 

## Create a timeline record

When enabled by your system administrator, the **Create a timeline record** ![](media\timeline-create-a-record-icon.png "Create a timeline record") icon allows you to quickly create appointments, send emails, and make notes and posts and associate them with other records. You can select the plus icon to view the options that are available for use.

 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![Create a timeline record](media\timeline-create-a-timeline-record.png "Create a timeline record")

For information on timeline record configuration, see:
- [How to configure activity record types](customer-service-hub-user-guide-timeline-admin.md#how-to-configure-activity-record-types)
- [Enable the ability to create directly from timeline](customer-service-hub-user-guide-timeline-admin.md#enable-the-ability-to-create-directly-from-timeline)

## Work with filters

When enabled by your system administrator, the timeline **Filter** further streamlines your productivity by allowing you to customize your experience and view data relevant to you. 

- **1:** The ![](media\timeline-filter-icon.png "Filter") icon allows you to **Filter**.
- **2:** A list of items that is enabled by your system administrator is displayed that you can filter.  

    ![Timeline filter functionality](media\timeline-filter-1.png "Timeline filter functionality")

For more information on timeline filter functionality and configurations see:
- [Enable filter pane](customer-service-hub-user-guide-timeline-admin.md#enable-filter-pane) 
- [How to filter activity types on timeline]() 

## Work with records

When working with records, you have key information at-a-glance, can view more by expanding records, and when you hover over a record, you have actions you can use.

### Expand all records

 When enabled by your system administrator, you can view timeline records at-a-glance in a collapsed format or expand a record to see more details for ease of use.

- **1:** When you select the ![](media\timeline-expand-icon.png "Expand all records") icon, it expands all records listed on your timeline.
- **2:** When the caret is in the upright position (^) in the bottom right corner, the record is displayed in the expanded view and a list of commands appear in the top right corner. Also, when you hover over an activity you want to view, the background turns grey.  When you hover away from the record, the background becomes transparent again.
- **3:** When the caret is in the down position (Ë…), the record is collapsed.

    ![Expand all records functionality](media\timeline-expand-all-records-1.png "Expand all records functionality")

For more information on expanding record functionality and configuration, see:
- [Expand all records in timeline](customer-service-hub-user-guide-timeline-admin.md#expand-all-records-in-timeline)
- [Expand records with images in timeline](customer-service-hub-user-guide-timeline-admin.md#expand-records-with-images-in-timeline)

## More Commands

The **More commands** icon contains refresh, sort, and email functionalities.

- **1:** When you select the **More commands** (![](media\timeline-more-commands.icon.png "More commands")) icon, the additional options are displayed.
- **2:** The **Refresh timeline** command allows you to update the details in the timeline.
- **3:** The **Sort newer to older** / **Sort older to newer** command allows you sort records.

    ![More commands timeline functionality](media\timeline-more-commands.png "More commands timeline functionality")

For information on using the **More commands** feature and configuration, see:
- [Quick entry record type and sort order default](customer-service-hub-user-guide-timeline-admin.md#quick-entry-record-type-and-sort-order-default)
- Threaded email views in timeline

## Threaded email views in timeline

To save valuable space, emails with multiple replies are consolidated into email threads and collapsed.

- **1:** Emails with multiple responses are grouped into threaded emails.
- **2:** To view the complete string of email responses, you can select **Show more** in the bottom left corner of the last visible email in the thread.
- **3:** When expanded, the most recent 10 email responses in the thread will display.  To display more, select **Show more** to expand the view again.
- **4:** Emails in the same thread are displayed as linked together.

![Timeline threaded email view functionality](media\timeline-threaded-email-views-1.png "Timeline threaded email view functionality")

### Enable threaded email views in timeline

Enabling the threaded email view is done via the timeline configuration in Power Apps. Threaded email views must be done in this setting for each specific timeline, for the specific form, for the specific entity.

You can use any of the following options for enabling threaded email views in timeline:

**Option 1:** 
1. Select the ![](media\timeline-more-commands.icon.png "More commands") **More commands** icon on the timeline, which will display a flyout menu.
2. Select **Always show email as conversations**. Now your emails will display in timeline threaded together.

![Enable threaded email timeline view - option 1](media\timeline-threaded-email-views-2.png "Enable threaded email timeline view - option 1")

**Option 2:**
1. On the command bar, select **Settings** > **Personalization Settings**. The **Set Personal Options** dialog box appears.
4. Select the **Email** tab.
5. Select the **Show emails as conversation on Timeline** check box.
6. Select **OK**.

    > ![Enable threaded email timeline view - option 2](media\timeline-threaded-email-views-3.png "Enable threaded email timeline view - option 2")

>[!Note]
> The **emails as conversation view** is based on the user's preference. Personal setting are tied to the user and not the form, which means once you enable the threaded email view, the setting is applied to all your timeline views. 

## Search records on timeline

When enabled by your system administrator, you can easily search for records in the timeline. When you search for a phrase in the timeline, it searches in the title or subject of the record or body or description fields of the record and displays the record for you.

- **1:** Use the **Search** bar on timeline to quickly find records.
- **2:** When you enter keywords or phrases, the search feature will retrieve and display results below the search bar.
- **3:** The keywords that you use to perform your search will be highlighted.

![Enable threaded email timeline view - option 2](media\timeline-search-records-1.png "Enable threaded email timeline view - option 2")

For more information, see, [Enable search bar](customer-service-hub-user-guide-timeline-admin.md#enable-search-bar).

## Work with notes and posts

Notes allows you to record richly formatted information and images for reference, summary, or investigation. You can easily add a mention to another user or a reference to a timeline record using Posts.  

### Add a note or post to a record on timeline

You can either add a **Note** or a **Post** to a record on timeline only if your system administrator has enabled the features.

1.	You can enter a **Note** to add to a record. If your system administrator does not have **Notes** enabled, you cannot add an attachment. Also, you can only add one attachment per note.
2.	You can enter a **Post** to add to a record.

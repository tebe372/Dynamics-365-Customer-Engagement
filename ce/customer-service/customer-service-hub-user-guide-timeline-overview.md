# Use Timeline

[!include[cc-early-access](../includes/cc-early-access.md)]

Timeline is a control that allows you to view different activity types that are connected to an entity record and occur over time in a single stream. Some activities that can be logged in the timeline are notes, phone calls, emails, appointments, and tasks.

Timeline allows you to:

- Quickly access on the command bar to perform common actions with ease.
- Filter and view your important activities using multiple filter options.
- View and manage email conversation threads with ease. 

## How to use timeline functionality

The following is an overview of how the timeline functionality works in each section on the entity form. The timeline section on the entity form is rich in features and functionality to help you navigate and streamline efforts.

The icons displayed in the top right nav in the Timeline give quick access to the following capabilities, when enabled by your system administrator:

- [Create a timeline record](#create-a-timeline-record)
- [Work with Filters](#work-with-filters)
- [Work with Records](#work-with-records)
- [Explore more commands](#more-commands)
- [Search Records](#search-records-on-timeline)
- [Add attachments](#add-an-attachment-to-a-note-in-timeline) 

## Create a timeline record

When enabled by your system administrator, the **Create a timeline record** ![Create timeline record](media\timeline-create-a-record-icon.png "Create a timeline record") icon allows you to quickly create appointments, send emails, and make notes and posts and associate them with other records. You can select the plus icon to view the options that are available for use.

For information on timeline record configuration, see [Configure activity record types](customer-service-hub-user-guide-timeline-admin.md#configure-activity-record-types)

## Work with filters

When enabled by your system administrator, the timeline **Filter** further streamlines your productivity by allowing you to customize your experience and view data relevant to you. 

![Timeline filter functionality](media\timeline-filter-1.png "Timeline filter functionality")

|Annotation|Description|

### How to filter records on timeline <a name="filter-records"></a>

Filters are valuable for sorting data. You can quickly filter activities, posts, and notes with multiple options to see what matters to you. The filter is available for the activities, posts, notes, and custom entities that are present in timeline. Timeline filters and displays the records and the count that are present in the timeline.

You can limit the records you're seeing by using the data filters. 

- When the **Filter** icon is transparent in the Timeline, it means there's no filter applied. When you select the icon, filter options are shown. <br>

    When you select the filter icon, the Filter by menu is displayed and you can filter items based on the following categories:

    |Category                   |Sub-category                            |
    |---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
    |Record type                |<li>Notes</li>                     <li>Posts</li><li>Activities</li>                     |
    |Activity type              |<li>Appointment</li><li>Campaign Activity</li> <li>Campaign Response</li><li>Email</li><li>Fax</li><li>Case Resolution</li><li>Letter</li><li>Opportunity Case</li>   <li>Order Case</li><li>Phone Call</li><li>Quote Close</li>           <li>Recurring Appointment</li><li>Social Activity</li><li>Task</li>   <li>Project Service Approval</li><li>Booking Alert</li><li>Conversation</li><li>Session</li><li>Customer Voice survey invite</li><li>Customer Voice survey response</li><li>Custom activities (as configured by your administrator)</li>|
    |Activity status            |<li>Active</li><li>Overdue</li>       <li>Closed</li>                         |
    |Activity due date (active) |<li>Next 30 days</li><li>Next 7 days</li><li>Next 24 hours</li><li>Last 24 hours</li><li>Last 7 days</li>   <li>Last 30 days</li>                   |
    |Posts by                   |<li>Auto post</li><li>Users</li>                          |
    |Modified date              |<li>Last 24 hours</li><li>Last 7 days</li><li>Last 30 days</li>                   |

    For example, when you select the **Activities** check box under **Record type** and **Overview** check box under **Activity status**, only the activities with status as Overdue are displayed. 

    ![Filter options](media\timeline-filter-options.png "Filter options")

- When the **Filter** icon is dark, it means filters are applied. To view what filters are selected, select the Filter applied icon ![Filter applied icon](media\timeline-filter-applied.png "Filter icon") **Filter**. The screen expands to show the filters selected/applied.</li>

- Select or clear the check boxes to apply or clear a specific filter.<br>

- To clear all the applied filters, select the **Clear all filters** icon ![Clear all fiters icon](media\timeline-clear-all-filters-icon.png "Clear all filters icon") icon.

## Work with records

When working with records, you have key information at-a-glance, can view more by expanding records, and when you hover over a record, you have actions you can use.

### Expand all records

 When enabled by your system administrator, you can view timeline records at-a-glance in a collapsed format or expand a record to see more details for ease of use.

### Enable threaded email views in timeline

Enabling the threaded email view is done via the timeline configuration in Power Apps. Threaded email views must be done in this setting for each specific timeline, for the specific form, for the specific entity.

You can use any of the following options for enabling threaded email views in timeline:

**Option 1:** 
1. Select the **More commands** icon on the timeline, which will display a flyout menu.

2. Select **Always show email as conversations**. Now your emails will display in timeline threaded together.

When enabled by your system administrator, you can easily search for records in the timeline. When you search for a phrase in the timeline, it searches in the title or subject of the record or body or description fields of the record and displays the record for you.

Notes allows you to record richly formatted information and images for reference, summary, or investigation. You can easily add a mention to another user or a reference to a timeline record using Posts.  

### Add a note or post to a record on timeline

You can either add a **Note** or a **Post** to a record on timeline only if your system administrator has enabled the features.

- You can enter a **Note** to add to a record. If your system administrator does not have **Notes** enabled, you cannot add an attachment. Also, you can only add one attachment per note.

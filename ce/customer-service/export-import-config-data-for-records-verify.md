# Verify migration of configuration data for the record channel

After you import the unified routing-related configuration data successfully from the source to target organization, perform the following steps in the target organization:

1. In the UI, make sure that the unified routing configuration and rulesets are rendered properly and don't display errors.

2. If skills and rating values are used in unified routing rulesets, then you need to manually link, associate, or create the users, bookable resources, and bookable resources characteristics records.
  
3. If capacity profiles are used in rulesets and workstreams for unified routing, then you need to manually link, associate, or create the users, bookable resources, and bookable resources capacity profile records.

# FAQs about unified routing in Customer Service, Omnichannel for Customer Service

## Overview

This topic contains the FAQs that you as an administrator, supervisor, or agent might have about unified routing.

### What SKUs must I have to get unified routing?​

Customers will get unified routing for entities, such as Cases, Leads, and custom entities as a part of the Customer Service Enterprise license. When you purchase channels (Chat and Digital messaging), you'll get unified routing for chat and messaging channels automatically.

### What will happen to my current workstreams after unified routing is installed?

For messaging channels, a migration utility will be available to upgrade the workstream and associated routing rules. For entity routing, you'll configure new workstreams and rules in unified routing.

### Why do I see workstreams that I didn't create in Omnichannel Administration?

These workstreams were created either in the Omnichannel admin center or Customer Service Hub app. In the Ommichannel Administration app, you'll see all the workstreams irrespective of the app that has been used to create them. We recommend that you manage the workstreams in the same app that you've used to create them.

### Will unified routing support activity routing?​

Yes, unified routing supports routing activities, including email.

### What happens to my existing queues after I migrate to unified routing?

The existing queues will be automatically migrated to unified routing.

### Will intelligent skill finder be available in all geographical regions?​

Intelligent skill finder requires AI Builder to create and train the machine learning (ML) model. If AI Builder is not available in the customer region where unified routing is, the customer will get a generic error when trying to setup the model​.

### Can I use intelligent skill finder with email activities?

Yes, intelligent skill finder can be enabled for any entity that is enabled for routing by using any text-based field. For email body skill finder, an additional step is required because email body (description) includes HTML tags that can impact the ML model. You'll extract the text from HTML, copy it into another text field, then configure the ML model against the new field.

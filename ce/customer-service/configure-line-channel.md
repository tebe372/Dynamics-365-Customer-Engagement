# Configure a LINE channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

Many customers use social messaging channels like LINE for their personal communication needs. Many also prefer using these messaging channels to engage with businesses. The asynchronous nature of these channels gives customers the convenience of getting their issues resolved as and when they find time, unlike real-time channels like Chat for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, where the session ends when the chat window is closed.

The LINE channel gives you an incredible opportunity to capitalize on the social media trend and engage with your customers in a seamless and personalized experience.

> [!NOTE]
> The LINE channel isn't available in the Government Community Cloud (GCC) region.

## Prerequisites

Following are the prerequisites before configuring the LINE channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable the LINE channel in an existing Omnichannel for Customer Service environment, you must [upgrade to the latest version of Omnichannel for Customer Service](upgrade-omnichannel.md).

1.	Create a LINE handle. More information: [Create and Manage a LINE profile](https://account.line.biz/signup)
2.	Create a LINE channel in the LINE Developers console. More information: [Create a LINE channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/getting-started/#creating-a-channel)

## Modify settings for a specific LINE account

1. In the Omnichannel Administration app, go to your LINE application and select the LINE account you want to modify. 

2. On the **General settings** tab, provide the following information:
    
    - **Language**: Select the preferred language for your LINE account.
    
    - **Work stream**: Select an existing work stream or create a new one.

    - **Enable file attachments for customers**: Set to **Yes** to allow customers to send file attachments to agents. Otherwise, set to **No**. 

    - **Enable file attachments for agents**: Set to **Yes** to allow agents to send file attachments to customers. When the agent sends an attachment, the app sends the blob storage URL to the channel. Otherwise, set to **No**. 
    
       To learn more about attachments, see [Enable file attachments](enable-file-attachments.md). 
       
       To learn more about uploading media in LINE, see [LINE developer documentation](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/).

3. On the **Automated messages** tab, [configure automated messages](configure-automated-message.md). 
    
4. On the **Surveys** tab, [configure a post-conversation survey](configure-post-conversation-survey.md).


## Create routing rules

1.	Go to **Work Distribution Management** > **Work Streams**.

2.	Open the out-of-the-box work stream or the one you created.

3.	On the **Routing rules items** tab, create a routing rule to transfer the message to an appropriate agent. Select the entity as **LINE Engagement Context**. For example, you can create a rule to transfer LINE chat from a customer named LINE to the default queue.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![LINE routing rule creation.](media/line-create-routing-rule.png "Create LINE routing rule")

## Customer and agent experiences

A customer can initiate a conversation in any of the following ways:

- LINE app on a mobile device
- LINE app on a desktop device
- [line.me/en/](https://line.me/en/)

If a customer initiates a conversation from the LINE website and then later switches to the mobile device, the previous conversation persists and the customer can continue the conversation.

The agent receives the notification of the incoming chat request, along with customer details. More information: [View notifications](oc-notifications.md)

Once the LINE social profile is linked to an user customer/contact record by the agent, subsequent LINE conversations are linked to the customer records and the customer summary is populated.

If the customer isn't identified by name, a new contact record can be created.

## Privacy notice

By enabling this feature, your data will be shared with LINE and flow outside of your organization's compliance and geo boundaries (even if your organization is in a Government Cloud environment). Please consult the feature technical documentation for more information [here](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-line?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true).

Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, such as laws relating to monitoring, recording, and storing communications with their end-users. This includes adequately notifying end-users that their communications with agents may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their agents that their communications with end-users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.

# Share knowledge articles in Omnichannel for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Enable knowledge article sharing in Omnichannel for Customer Service so that customer queries can be resolved quickly. You can configure an external portal in the **Customer Service Hub** app in a way that your customer service agents can share knowledge article links with the customers from within the Omnichannel for Customer Service app.

Follow these steps to enable knowledge article sharing:

1. In the Customer Service Hub sitemap, go to **Service Management** and select **Knowledge Base Management** > **Embedded Knowledge Search**.

2. In the **Support Portal Connection** section, enter the following:  

    a. **Use an external portal**. Select **Yes** to enable the external portal and share the article as a link. </br>

    b. **URL Format**. Type the portal URL that will be used to create external (public-facing) portal links for knowledge articles, which the service agents can share with the customers. The external URL is created in the following format: 
        </br> </br> *https://\<support portal URL>/kb/{kbnum}* 
  
     The placeholder "{kbnum}" is replaced by an actual knowledge article number.

3. Select **Save**.

# Manage changes to customer service and holiday schedules

## Introduction

This topic describes how you can manage the impact of changes to the customer service and holiday schedules of your SLA KPIs.

## Understand time calculation of SLA KPIs

To manage changes to customer service and holiday schedules of your SLA KPIs, you must first understand how the time calculation for SLA KPIs work. The time calculation for SLA KPIs works according to the Warning and Failure time, which are based on the customer service and holiday schedules associated with the SLA KPI instance.

Here is an example of a SLA KPI that describes how time calculation works:
Conditions set for the SLA KPI:
- Defined working hours: 9 AM to 5 PM (8 hours daily)
- Failure duration: 12 hours
- Holiday calendar: The next day is marked as a holiday
- Case is created today on 10 AM

So, after time calculation, the failure duration will be day after tomorrow 14:00 (2 PM). Here, the time calculation works in the following way: The working hours for the day 5PM â€“ 10AM = 7 Hours, which leaves 5 hours for tomorrow (calculated as failure duration - hours consumed today). The next day is skipped as it is a Holiday. So, the failure duration will be day after tomorrow: 9 AM + 5 hours= 14:00 (2 PM).

Apart from `WarningTime` and `FailureTime` calculation, SLA time calculation also involves calculating the Elapsed time, if there is a Pause and Resume scenario. The elapsed time is added to the final failure time to ignore the working hours spent during the Paused state.

For more information on creating customer service schedules, see: [Create customer service schedule and define the work hours](create-customer-service-schedule-define-work-hours.md#create-customer-service-schedule-and-define-the-work-hours).

For more information on creating holiday schedules, see: [Create and manage holiday schedules](set-up-holiday-schedule.md#create-and-manage-holiday-schedules).

## Best practices CS or Holiday schedule of the SLA

Whenever any SLA KPI instance is created, the Warning Time and Failure Time is created depending on the factors described in [Understand time calculation of SLA KPIs](#understand-time-calculation-of-sla-kpis) section. So, changing the calendar working hours doesn't impact the existing KPI instances.

However, you may also have the following scenarios which affect the existing KPI instances:

- Pause/Resume scenario
- SLA changed scenario
- SLA Item is changed
- SLA KPI instance is reapplied after terminal state (in case of Recalculation on Terminal State)

In the above scenarios, the latest calendar information and values are re-calculated with the new customer service schedule and the holiday schedule. However, if you want to change the existing customer service schedule which is already in use in the existing SLA KPI instances, you can implement the following suggestions.

The section describes the use cases and the best practices you can apply.  

As in above scenarios, 
Disclaimer: Please validate all business scenarios and use cases to ensure all the use-cases are met before applying the changes to production.


## Scenarios

**Scenario 1:**

Only 1 SLA KPI is set as Default.
-	1 Calendar
-	Multiple SLA items.
-	With or without a Pause and Resume scenario.
-	There is no need to update existing running KPI instances.

Recommendation:
 
- Don't modify the existing SLA and calendar. The earlier SLA can continue to remain in Active state on the production org. Create a similar SLA with a new calendar and the same kind of SLA items.
- Activate the new SLA and set as Default. This will ensure that all the new cases are created with the new SLA and time calculation will be done with the new calendar information.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not using a Default SLA, update your SLA condition to update the SLA ID in the Case entity accordingly. More information: [Apply SLAs on demand<a name="apply-sla-on-demand"></a>](define-service-level-agreements.md#apply-slas-on-demanda-nameapply-sla-on-demanda).

**Scenario 2**

- Multiple SLA
- Multiple Calendars
- Multiple SLA items.
- No Pause and Resume scenario / or with Pause & Resume state.
- No need to update existing running KPI instances.

Recommendation:

- Don't modify the existing SLAs and calendars. The earlier SLAs can continue to remain in Active state on the production org. Create similar SLAs with a new calendar and the same kind of SLA items. 
- Activate the new SLAs. This will ensure that all the new cases are created with the new SLA and time calculation will be done with the new calendar information.
- Update your SLA conditions to update the SLA ID in the case entity accordingly. More information: [Apply SLAs on demand<a name="apply-sla-on-demand"></a>](define-service-level-agreements.md#apply-slas-on-demanda-nameapply-sla-on-demanda).

**Scenario 3**

- Multiple SLA
- Multiple Calendars
- Multiple SLA items.
- No Pause and Resume scenario
- Need to update existing running KPI instances.

Recommendation:

- Modify the existing calendars. This will ensure that all the new cases are created with same SLA and time calculation is done with the new Calendar information. However, the existing running KPI instances won't consider the new calendar automatically. So, you have to initiate an event to allow the KPI instance to pick the new calendar. 

For example, introduce the Pause state and trigger a quick Pause and then Resume update on the case. This will trigger the KPI instance to pick the new calendar information. To initiate the Pause and Resume, you can either allow the end user to do this update on each case one by one or write a custom logic to run this update in dark hours.

For example, a flow can run in dark hours, with the following logic:
- Find the associated SLA from a calendar which needs to be updated.
- Find all the incidents which have same SLA ID field value as the above SLA. You can do this in batches to avoid running into scalability issues.
- Do a update on the case to put it in a Paused state.
- Do the next update on the case which puts it back into Resume.

> [!NOTE]
> This will be an intensive operation based on the SLA KPI instances and incidents in your environment.

**Scenario 4**

- Multiple SLA
- Multiple Calendars
- Multiple SLA items.
- Has Pause and Resume scenario
- Need to update existing running KPI instances.

Recommendation:

This is a partially supported scenario and will cause unexpected results for those KPI instances which were put into Paused or Resumed state before the new calendar was applied.
As those instances might have calculated elapsed time during pause/resume with old calendars already, so the final calculation will be partly with old calendar and partly with new calendar.

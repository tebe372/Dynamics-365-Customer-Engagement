# Introduction to intraday supervisor experiences

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> With the release of [real-time analytics reports in Omnichannel for Customer Service](enable-realtime-analytics-dashboard-administrator.md), our latest analytics capability, we announce that the intraday insights for Omnichannel for Customer Service will be deprecated on October 31, 2023. We recommend that you use real-time analytics reports, which provide real-time information about the health and key performance indicators of your organization. For more information on the deprecation, go to [Intraday insights for Omnichannel for Customer Service to be deprecated](deprecations-customer-service.md#intraday-insights-for-omnichannel-for-customer-service-to-be-deprecated).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is intended to help customer service managers or supervisors enhance their teamâ€™s performance and improve customer satisfaction. This feature is not intended for use in making, and should not be used to make, decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring, recording, and storing communications with end users. This also includes adequately notifying end users that their communications with agents may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their agents that their communications with end users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.

Customer service managers or supervisors are responsible for managing the agents who work with customers to resolve queries every day through various service channels.

Omnichannel for Dynamics 365 Customer Service provides dashboards that help supervisors keep track of the work that their agents do. As a supervisor, you can use these dashboards to perform these tasks:

- Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs)

- Monitor quality and workload of agent

- Monitor unassigned workload

- Manage agent and customer escalations

As a supervisor, you see the following tabs when you open the Omnichannel for Customer Service app:

- **My dashboard**: This tab provides information about the conversations that you're directly connected and engaged with customers as an agent, such as your ongoing conversations, items that are available for you to pick, and closed conversations. To learn more, see [Introduction to the agent interface](oc-introduction-agent-interface.md). 

- **Omnichannel intraday insights dashboard**: This tab provides an overview of information about the health and KPIs of agents in your organization. The information in this dashboard is displayed based on the last 24 hours conversations. To learn more, see [Omnichannel intraday insights dashboard](intraday-insights-dashboard.md). If you're unable to view the dashboards, contact your system administrator. More information: [Configure to view intraday insights dashboard](configure-intraday-dashboard-supervisor.md). The intraday insights reports are available only in the English language, out of the box. You'll need to customize the reports to make them available in a language of your choice.

  This tab also displays all the reports and dashboards configured in the corresponding Power BI workspace.

- **Ongoing Conversations dashboard**: This tab provides information about the conversations that agents are handling and are in active, open, wrap up, and waiting status reason. To learn more, see [Ongoing Conversations dashboard](ongoing-conversations-dashboard.md).

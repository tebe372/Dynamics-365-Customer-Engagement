#### **Search for records**

You can easily search for records in the timeline. When you search for a phrase, the timeline searches the title or subject and description or body of the content, and then displays the record to you.

  ![Timeline keyword search](../customer-service/media/timeline-keyword-search.png "Timeline keyword search")

#### **View and manage email conversations**

You can easily set email messages to show as conversation threads on the timeline, significantly reducing usability (scroll and clicks) when managing email activities.

#### Configure Timeline section for your users

To learn more about configuration, see [Set up timeline section (control)](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/set-up-timeline-control) and [FAQs for timeline control](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/faqs-timeline-control) in the Microsoft Power Apps documentation.

### Related section

In the **Related** section (also known as Reference panel), use the tabs to see related records for the current record. This section is enabled by default for account, contact, case, and knowledge article records. Your customizer can add this section for all entities (including custom entities) that are enabled for interactive experience. The reference panel is also available in model-driven apps, for information, see  [Reference Panel in model-driven apps ](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/navigation#reference-panel).

By default, the first tab in the Related section of a case record shows the **Recent Cases and Entitlements** for the current case record you're working on. 
  
![reference-panel](media/reference-panel.png "Reference panel")

The second tab in the Related section of a case record is the **Knowledge Base search**. Knowledge Base search lets you search for the knowledge articles related to a specific record. It also lets you view automatic suggestions. You can filter the search results to display articles that are Published, Draft, or Approved. For more information, see [Search for Knowledge articles](search-knowledge-articles-csh.md). 
  

The third tab in the Related section of a case record displays **Similar Cases**. Select **...** on a record to follow or unfollow the case, and explore other options. 

![similar-cases](media/similar-cases.png "Similar cases in Reference panel")

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure rules that help you view similar cases based on automatic suggestions. For more information, see [Use advanced similarity rules to view similar case suggestions](suggest-similar-cases-for-a-case.md).

Similarly,

- For **Accounts** records, you can view **Contacts**, **Recent Opportunities**, **Recent Cases**, and **Entitlements** in the Related section.
- For **Contacts** records, the Related section displays **Recent Opportunities**, **Recent Cases**, and **Entitlements**. 
- For **Knowledge articles** records, select an article and go to the **Summary** tab to view the **Related Information** panel. Here you can view **Related versions**, **Related translations**, **Related categories**, **Related articles**, and **Related products** for an article.

> [!NOTE]
> Your system administrator or customizer can choose if Related section should be included in a form. They can also decide on what related data should be displayed in the section for each form.


#### Reference Panel reflow

The Customer Service Hub is available to use on a desktop browser, and on a mobile device. Depending on the zoom level and the resolution of the system on which you are accessing the hub interface, the Reference panel adjusts the tabs and records for an optimum experience.

For example, on a browser, if you zoom in to about 100% or more, the tabs get docked on the top of the panel.

![reference-panel-zoomin](media/rp-zoomin.png "Reference panel reflow")

Similarly, if you zoom out to about 60-70%, the records appear in grid form.

![reference-panel-zoomout](media/rp-grid-zoomout.png "Reference panel reflow")

## Understand Activities

Activities are the tasks that you or your team perform while interacting with customers. An activity is any action which can be entered on a calendar and has time dimensions (start time, stop time, due date, and duration) that help determine when the action occurred or is planned to occur.

For example, you can make a record to track a phone call with a customer, or list an appointment scheduled with a customer to discuss a certain issue. You can create activities for yourself, or assign them to other service reps.

In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, the following activities are supported:
- Email
- Task
- Appointment
- Phone Call
- Social Activity

> [!NOTE]
> You can create and edit emails in the Customer Service Hub app on a desktop browser. However, on a mobile device email is read-only in the Hub app.

#### Open Activities view

In the Customer Service Hub sitemap, select **Service** > **Activities**. The **My Activities** view is displayed. 

![activities-email](media/activities-csh-email.png "Activities view")

- Select ![quick-create-activity](media/quick-create-button.png) in the nav bar to go to **Activities** to quickly add a new activity.

- Select the **My Activities** drop-down to switch between activity views.

- Select the  **Due** drop-down to see the list of activities that are due in coming time or are already overdue.

- Explore the command bar options to create a new activity like new **Task**, **Email**, **Appointment**, or **Phone call**.

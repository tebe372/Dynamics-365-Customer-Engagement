# Understand the knowledge article creation process

With the knowledge management module, you can create and manage knowledge articles that your users may be looking for. This will help reduce the call handling times for agents as they can look up information in a knowledge base to resolve customer queries right away, thereby increasing their productivity.

The following diagram describes the default process for creating and using knowledge articles in the Customer Service Hub. Create an article and mark it for review. The reviewer can approve or reject the article. If the article is rejected, it is sent back for edits or updates. If the article is approved, it is published on the portal. It is also available in search and can be translated.

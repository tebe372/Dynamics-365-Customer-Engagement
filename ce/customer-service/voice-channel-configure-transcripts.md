# Configure call recording, transcription, and real-time translation

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

As an administrator, you can enable live translation, transcription and recording of calls, which allows agents and supervisors to view the conversations with the customers in the language that's set as the default for them, and also transcripts of customer calls.

> [!NOTE]
> Many countries and states have laws and regulations that apply to the recording of PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), voice, and video calls, and may require that users first consent to the recording of their communications. It is your responsibility to use the call recording and transcription capabilities in compliance with the law. Before using call recording features, you must obtain consent from the parties of recorded communications in a manner that complies with all applicable laws for each participant.

### Storage location of your recordings and cost

The maximum file size of a recording can be 512 MB. The voice recording and transcript data resides in the following locations:

- **Data at rest**: Is stored in Dataverse wherever your Dynamics instance is located.
- **Data in transit**: For components within the Microsoft stack, we strive to ensure that data doesnâ€™t cross geographical boundaries during transit. The bring-your-own-carrier model has dependencies on third parties, and therefore, data needs to be reviewed end-to-end and will include components outside the Microsoft stack.

The data storage costs with two participants only is calculated approximately as follows and the cost can fluctuate:

- 20-minute call recording = 10240 KB
- 20-minute call transcript = 40 KB

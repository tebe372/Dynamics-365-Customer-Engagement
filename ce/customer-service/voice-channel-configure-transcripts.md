# Configure call recording, transcription, and real-time translation

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

As an administrator, you can enable live translation, transcription and recording of calls, which allows agents and supervisors to view the conversations with the customers in the language that's set as the default for them, and also transcripts of customer calls.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Many countries and states have laws and regulations that apply to the recording of PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), voice, and video calls, and may require that users first consent to the recording of their communications. It is your responsibility to use the call recording and transcription capabilities in compliance with the law. Before using call recording features, you must obtain consent from the parties of recorded communications in a manner that complies with all applicable laws for each participant.
> - If you use Power Virtual Agents bots as the interactive voice response (IVR) with the voice channel, the calls are transcribed in Power Virtual Agents even if the transcription and recording setting isn't enabled in the voice workstream.

Alternatively, you can delete the recordings from the [msdyn_ocrecording](developer/reference/entities/msdyn_ocrecording.md) entity by using the [DELETE](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/update-delete-entities-using-web-api) request.

### Storage location of your recordings and cost
 
For components within the Microsoft stack, the data doesnâ€™t cross geographical boundaries during transit. The bring-your-own-carrier model has dependencies on third parties with components outside the Microsoft stack, and the data needs to be reviewed end-to-end. The components can be in a different geographic location from the Azure Communication Services location as shown in the image below:

**Legend**

| Number | Description |
|-----|-------------------|
|1 | **Session Border Controller**<br>  For Microsoft calling plans where Microsoft is the carrier, Microsoft determines the location where the data is stored.<br> **Direct Routing**:  For the bring-your-own-carrier model, the data resides in the region where the Session Border Controller is hosted. |
|2 | **Azure Communication Services**:<br>  The data resides in the location where the Azure Communication Services subscription is acquired. |
|3 | **Microsoft Dataverse**:<br>  The Microsoft Dataverse server location, Dynamics 365 tenant, Cosmos DB, and Azure Speech Service should all be in the same location chosen during purchase |
|4 | **Kusto**:<br> Microsoft stores the data for telemetry in Kusto, which is located either in the EMEA or the East US cluster. |


The maximum file size of a recording can be 512 MB. The data storage costs with two participants only is calculated approximately as follows and the cost can fluctuate:

- 20-minute call recording = 10240 KB
- 20-minute call transcript = 40 KB

## Overview

This topic contains the FAQs that you as an administrator might have about the Customer Service admin center app.

### What's the difference between Omnichannel admin center and Customer Service admin center?

Customer Service admin center unifies all the administration settings in Customer Service Hub and Omnichannel admin center. The site map is task oriented, and only navigation to the entities has changed. You don't need to migration data, you just need to start to use this new app and get used to it.  

### Can I customize this new application?

Similar to other apps, you can use the App designer to  customize the site map entries. If you have custom entities that your administrators use to manage different aspects of your business, then you can add them to the Customer Service admin center site map, so that your administrators donâ€™t need to use a separate app. To avoid conflicts with site map entries that are available out of the box, we recommend that you create a new sub area to add your site map entries.

### When do you plan to deprecate existing admin experience?

After Customer service admin center becomes generally available, we will leave some time for customers to get used it and provide feedback. This new app will co-exist with the existing admin experience. We'll then announce the deprecation of the legacy app. We recommend that you start using this app for the seamless benefits.

# FAQs about Customer Service admin center

## Overview

This topic contains the frequently asked questions (FAQs) that you as an administrator might have about the Customer Service admin center app.

### What's the difference between Omnichannel admin center and Customer Service admin center?

Customer Service admin center unifies all the administration settings in Customer Service Hub, Omnichannel admin center, and app profile manager. The site map is task oriented, with overview pages and feature landing pages to easily locate each capability. The user experience is consolidated and improved, and you don't need to migrate any data. Try the new app for centrally managing the features.

### Can I customize this new application?

Similar to other apps, you can use the App designer to  customize the site map entries. If you have custom entities that your administrators use to manage different aspects of your business, then you can add them to the Customer Service admin center site map, so that your administrators donâ€™t need to use a separate app. To avoid conflicts with site map entries that are available out of the box, we recommend that you create a new sub area to add your site map entries.

### When do you plan to deprecate existing admin experience?

After Customer service admin center becomes generally available, we will leave some time for customers to get familiar with it and provide feedback. This new app will coexist with the existing admin experience. We'll then announce the deprecation of the existing admin experience in Customer Service Hub, Omnichannel admin center, and app profile manager. We recommend that you start using this app for the seamless benefits it offers.

### Why can't I see this app in my environment?

The app will be enabled automatically in all the Customer Service organizations, but it follows an availability schedule, so some regions will get it before the others. For the North America region, the app is available from March 04, 2022.

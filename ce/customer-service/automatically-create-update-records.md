# Automatically create or update records in Customer Service Hub

In Dynamics 365 Customer Service Hub, you can automatically create or update system or custom records from incoming activities, such as emails, social activities, and custom activities. In this section, you will learn about creating rules for automatically creating records for cases from incoming emails.

## Set up rules for creating or updating records automatically

Every organization has multiple applications to capture customer interactions. The ability to channel external data into the Common Data Service platform records can significantly improve the efficiency of your sales, marketing, and service teams, and increase the quality of your data. You can now direct this data from various applications and external sources into the Common Data Service platform with the help of *record creation and update rules*.

 A record creation and update rule consists of rule items that define the conditions for creating or updating records, and also defines what actions or steps to take on the records.

## Activities and entities supported by rules for creating or updating records automatically

 By default, Dynamics 365 Customer Service supports creating records from the following activities:  

- Email
- Social activity
- Task
- Phone call
- Appointment
- Service activity
- Custom activity

These activities can be converted to any default (system) entity records or custom entity records. For example, you could create a lead, opportunity (system record), or incident (custom record) from an incoming email.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Permission or role to create rules
- Information on the queues for which you want to create the rules

## Configure rules for creating or updating records automatically

You can configure a rule that when active will be run for incoming emails. Using the feature to create rules, you can define the conditions when a rule can be run.

1. In Customer Service Hub site map, go to **Service Management**, and select **Automatic record creation and update rules**. The **Record creation and update rules** page appears.

2. Select **New**. The **New Record Creation and Update Rule** page is displayed.

3. On the **Basic** tab, in **Step one details**, enter the following details:
  
   - **Rule name**: Enter a name for the rule.
   - **Queue to monitor**: Select a queue on which the rule will be activated. For email activity, you must select a queue to be able to activate the rule.
   - **Activity type to monitor**: Select **Email** in the list.

4. Select **Save**. The **Step two: conditions to evaluate and actions to take** area is enabled.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Automatically create record rule](media/arc-csh-rule.png " Automatically create record rule")

5. In **Step two: conditions to evaluate and actions to take**, select **New**. The **Condition builder** page is displayed.
6. Perform the following steps:

   a. In **Condition** > **Condition name**, enter an intuitive name.

   b. In **Condition that must pass to continue (pass if blank)**, select **Add**.
   c. Use the following options To define the criteria for the rule to be evaluated:

      i. Add row

      ii. Add group

      iii. Add related entity

7. In **Actions to take** > **Record to create**, make sure the value is **Case**. A case will be created if the conditions specified are met for the email activity.

8. In **Configure in Microsoft Power Automate**, select **Save and open in Power Automate**. The Power Automate application opens in a new tab where you can configure criteria that must be evaluated for the email activity. To learn more about using Power Automate, see the [documentation for Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started).

9. Select **Save & Close**. The condition builder is closed.

10. In **Step three: additional actions to take after matching with a condition**, select an option based on your requirement for **Automatically reply to email**.

11. If you select **Yes**, select an email template in the **Select email template** list box.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Automatically create record rule configured](media/arc-csh-rule-all-steps-configured.png " Automatically create record rule configured")

  > [!NOTE]
  > The rule will be in the draft status till you activate it.

## Configure advanced settings for rules

On the **Advanced** tab of the **Record creation and update rule** page for a rule, you can configure actions that can be automatically performed before the conditions for the rule are evaluated.

1. On the **Automatic record creation and update rules** page, select the rule in the list that you want to update. The *<rule_name>* page appears.
2. Select the **Advanced** tab, and do the following in **Before evaluating conditions**:

   - **Allow emails from unknown senders:** Set it to yes if you want records to be created when email messages arrive from senders whose email addresses aren't present in any records. A contact record is also created.

        This option, in conjunction with the Automatically create records in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement option in the rule owner's Personal Options, determines whether a case and contact record is created. To learn more, see [Set personal options](../customerengagement/on-premises/basics/set-personal-options.md).

   - **Manage unknown senders by:** Select one of the following options:
     - **Creating a new contact automatically:** Specify if you want a contact to be created automatically.
     - **Mapping in Power Automate manually:** Specify if you want to evaluate and set up the resolution for the contact in Power Automate.
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > If you select to map the contact manually, make sure that you create a mapping in Power Automate for the customer field. More information: [Manually map a contact in Power Automate](#configure-in-power-automate)
   - **Require a valid entitlement on the connected case:** If you select **Yes**, the Common Data Service platform creates a case only if an active entitlement exists for the customer.

        If the sender of the email is a contact with a parent account, the Common Data Service platform creates a record if the contactâ€™s parent account has a valid entitlement, and the contact is listed in the **Contacts** section of the entitlement or if the **Contacts** section is empty (which means the entitlement is applicable to all contacts for the customer).

   - **Wait for a specific amount of time after the connected case has been resolved:** If you select **Yes**, select a time value in the **Select the amount of time** box that appears.

    If set to no, a case will be created even if a related case exists. When set to yes, no new case will be created till the specified period of time lapses after a related case is resolved. For example, if you have set the value to yes and specify one hour, and a case exists for a printer issue, when a mail comes for the same printer issue, another case will not be created till one hour lapses after the existing printer issue case is resolved.

3. In **Advanced settings**, by default the user who is creating the rule is listed in the **Owner whose permissions the rule uses to run** box. You can add more users or change the default value.
4. Select **Save** or **Save & Close**.

## Activate a rule for creating or updating records automatically

 For any record creation and update rule to apply to a matching incoming activity, after you add the rule items, you must activate the rule.

## Change the order of rule items to be evaluated

The rules are run in the order they are listed in the rule items list. If the incoming activity matches the condition specified in the rule item one, the case is created and the rest of the rule items are not evaluated. If more than one rule item exists for a rule, you can reorder the rule items.

## Use activity monitor to review and track rules

[!include[cc-early-access](../includes/cc-early-access.md)]

You can review and track the health of the automatic record creation rules and resolve issues around them. By default, the activity monitor captures failed events. You can customize the events that you want to monitor by using the monitor options in the application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The activity monitor tracks the rules only till they are evaluated in Customer Service Hub before the rule is run in Power Automate.

The following details are available for the rules:

- **Current state:** Displays the state, such as, Failed, Skipped, or Ready for Power Automate.
- **Rule name:** Name of the record creation rule.
- **Monitored activity type:** Activity type, such as email, task, or appointment.
- **Monitored activity item:** Displays the subject of the activity type.
- **Condition name:** The name of the condition in which the issue occurred.
- **Reason:** Displays information on how the rule was handled. For example, if the value in Current state for a rule is Skipped, no action would have been taken because the rule condition, such as **Allow email from unknown senders** was set to No. Therefore, no further action was required for the rule.
- **Evaluated on:** Displays the date and time of the issue.

1. On the **Record creation and update rules** page, select **View activity monitor** on the command bar. The **Activity monitor for record creation and update rules** page displays the list of rules with their statuses.
2. Use the Advanced filters option to narrow down the view to list rules, such as list only those rules that match a specified condition.
3. Double-click a rule or activity to view the activity monitoring summary that is displayed on the **Activity monitor** *<rule_name>* page.
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - Use the browser navigation option to go back to the previous page.
    > - If you navigate to an active rule from the activity monitor page, a message appears stating that the rule is active and therefore is read-only.
    > - The legacy rules will also be monitored and listed on the activity monitor view.

4. Perform the following steps to select the states you want to monitor:
   1. Select **Monitor options** on the command bar. The **Monitor options** dialog box appears.
   2. Select any or all the following states:
      - Ready for Power Automate / workflow
      - Failed
      - Skipped

## How do record creation and update rules work with queues

 In a record creation and update rule, when you specify a queue for a source type, any incoming activity from that source is added as a queue item for that specified queue. That is, if a rule for a particular source activity and queue combination is active, the rule processes the incoming activity on that queue to create or update records.  

 For an email source type, specifying a queue is mandatory. For all other source types including custom activities, it is optional.  

> [!NOTE]
> When an automatic record creation (ARC) rule is applied to an Email queue item, it gets deactivated.

## Manage automatic record creation and update rule from a queue form

 You can create or manage an automatic record creation and update rule from a queue form. To learn more, see [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create or change a queue](set-up-queues-manage-activities-cases.md)

## Manually map a contact in Power Automate<a name="configure-in-power-automate"></a>

Perform the following steps in Power Automate to manually map a contact:

1. Edit the rule in which you want to configure the manual mapping.
2. On the **Condition builder** tab, select **Save and open Power Automate**. The Power Automate workflow opens on a new tab.
3. In the **Create a record (don't rename this step)** step of the workflow, specify the required value in the **Customer (Contacts)** box.
4. Make sure that you remove the default mappings from **Contact (Contacts)** and **Customer (Accounts)**.
   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Configure manual mapping for creating contact](media/arc-manual-power-automate.png " Configure manual mapping for creating contact")

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you want to map an account, make sure that you remove the default mappings from the **Contact (Contacts)** and **Customer (Contacts)** boxes and specify only an account in the **Customer (Accounts)** box for the workflow to run without errors.

5. Save and close.

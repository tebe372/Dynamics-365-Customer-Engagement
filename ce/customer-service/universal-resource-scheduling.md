# Search resource availability and create bookings for requirement groups

Use the Search Resource Availability for Requirement Group API and the Create Requirement Group Bookings API to book the resources that meet the needs you identify in your requirement groups. 

- The [Search Resource Availability for Requirement Group](#bkmk_sra_rg) API returns available time slots for resources when you search by using requirement groups.
- The [Create Requirement Group Bookings](#bkmk_crgb) API uses the available time slots for resources to generate booking records for your requirement groups.

You pass the details of a requirement group in your API calls and retrieve a list of available resources and their open time slots. This is helpful for self-scheduling scenarios, where a user wants to view the availability of resources, or for portal scheduling scenarios where a customer wants to view resource availability from a website or app.

### Prerequisites

- Dynamics 365 version 9.0 or above with Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.x.x

### Output 

Returns `HandlerExecuted` value which is of Boolean type.

## Using the Requirement Group API

In the following scenario, you schedule a requirement group via API. You'll need a service created with resources before you can schedule a booking. Follow these steps to create a service activity.

### Service configuration 

![Service configuration ](media/ur-scheduling-1-new.png "Service configuration")

  1. In the site map, under **Scheduling**, select **Service**.
  2. Go to **Resource Requirements**.
  3. Create a service activity. For this example, we've created **Test Requirement Group**.

### Service Activity configuration  

![Service Activity configuration](media/ur-scheduling-2-new.png "Service Activity configuration")

  1. In the site map, under **Scheduling**, select **Service Activities**.
  5. Go to **Service Activities**.
  6. For **Subject**, select **Test Requirement Group**.
  7. For **Service**, select **Test Requirement Group**.

> [!NOTE]
> This automatically creates a resource requirement group that has the same name as the service activity. 

Now you have a requirement group automatically created that has one technician (resource) to be scheduled to perform service at your customer's location. 

### Resource Requirement Group grid 

The following image is an example configuration of the Resource Requirement Group page. 

![Active Requirements Group](media/ur-scheduling-3-new.png "Active Requirements Group")

> [!NOTE] 
> To access the **Requirement Group** page from the Customer Service Hub app, you need to navigate there via a URL. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the following URL to reach the **Resource Requirements Group** page: <<YourOrgURL>YourOrgURL>?appid=guid&pagetype=entitylist&etn=msdyn_requirementgroupr.


![Test Requirements Group](media/ur-scheduling-4-new.png "Test Requirements Group")

3. Go to **General**.
4. Name field **Test Requirement Group**.
5. Enter name in **Owner** field.
6. Template field.
7. Template Required, select **No**.

### Search against your organization

In this next scenario, we show how to pass values for a specific requirement group (Entity Reference - GUID), Required Resources<!--what is this?--> to complete work and match the resource to the organizational unit.      

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> - To run the Requirement Group API, you need GUIDs for:
>   - Requirement group
>   - Bookable resources
>   - Organizational unit (which can be retrieved by using the [Web API](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/query-metadata-web-api))
> - If the API is called from a client (browser or canvas app) based on JavaScript, you need to have the extended SOAP SDK. The extended SOAP SDK is not an official Microsoft release, but you can is provided in the downloadable sample files for guidance. 
> - We recommend that you test this search in your development or test environments to validate your scenarios and results before running it in your production environment.

To execute this search against your organization, you need to download the [sample files](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/customer-service/service-scheduling/search-resource-availability-create-bookings), and then follow the steps below:   

1. Modify the hard-coded input parameters in the msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroupSample.js file to reflect the GUIDs of records in your org. (Example: requirement group, resources, organizational unit).    

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-5.PNG)

[Sample Search Requirement Group](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/sushant-service-scheduling/customer-service/master/search-resource-availability-create-bookings)

2. Add the files in the sample folder as web resources in your organization 

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-6-new.png)

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-7-new.PNG)

3. Navigate to the newly added new_msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroupSample.htm page. Example: <<YourOrgURL>>//WebResources/new_msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroupSample.htm   

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-8.PNG)

4. Open the browser's developer tools by using the F12 function key. Set breakpoints as needed, and inspect the request/responses in the developer tool's console.  

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-9.PNG)

  We can see there are multiple sets of time slots that are returned with each Set corresponding to a matching available Resource mapped to the underlying Requirement of the Requirement Group.   

  After the time slot Sets are returned by the API, you can display them on your custom web portal, app, or a Power App (model/canvas).    

5. After you choose a specific time slot set (Set number 1 in this example), update your new_msdyn_CreateRequirementGroupBookingsSample.js web resource in your org to pass the Resource Assignments (Requirement guid, Resource guid) and the Requirement Group as shown in the example below:    

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-10-new.PNG)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Find the complete sample code here: [Create Requirement Group](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/customer-service/service-scheduling/search-resource-availability-create-bookings).

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-11-new.png)

6. Navigate to the newly added new_ msdyn_CreateRequirementGroupBookingsSample.htm page. (Example: <<YourOrgURL>>//WebResources/new_msdyn_CreateRequirementGroupBookingsSample.htm) to invoke a call to the Booking API and create the booking.

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-12.png)

7. Open the browser's developer tools by using the F12 function key. Here you'll see that the Handler executed value is set to True, indicating that the bookings were created successfully.    

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-13.png)

  We can also verify this by going back into the organization and checking the associated bookings of the Service/Requirement group we created, as shown in the following illustrations.    

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-14-new.png)

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters](media/ur-scheduling-15-new.png)

Other possible scenarios that might leverage these APIs are:   
- Build a custom web app or a Dynamics 365 portal to provide appointment scheduling for users. The app will show available time slots for the service or product being offered by using multiresource requirements (requirement groups).
- Build a Power Apps canvas app to support self-scheduling scenarios for line-of-business apps.    

See the [Additional resources](#bkmk_seealso) section for links to additional help resources.

### Sample code

The sample code given below shows how to implement `msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup` message.

```csharp
void Main()  
{   
// Authentication   
String machineName = "aurorav?????";   
String orgName = "CITTest";   
String domain = $"{machineName}dom.extest.microsoft.com";   
String uri = $"http://{machineName}.{domain}/{orgName}/XRMServices/2011/Organization.svc";   
String username = "administrator";   
String password = "";

// Connect to organization
Microsoft.Pfe.Xrm.OrganizationServiceManager osm = new
Microsoft.Pfe.Xrm.OrganizationServiceManager(new Uri(@uri), username, password, domain);

searchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup(osm);  
createRequirementGroupBookings(osm);  
}   

void searchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup(OrganizationServiceManager osm) 
{
var req = new OrganizationRequest()
{
RequestName = "msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup"
};  

//Version  
req["Version"] = "1.0.0";
req["RequirementGroup"] = new EntityReference("msdyn_requirementgroup", Guid.Parse(""));

var response = osm.GetProxy().Execute(req);
}   

void createRequirementGroupBookings(OrganizationServiceManager osm)
{
var req = new OrganizationRequest()
{   
RequestName = "msdyn_createRequirementGroupBookings"
};   
 
//Version
req["Version"] = "1.0.0";
req["RequirementGroup"] = new EntityReference("msdyn_requirementgroup", 
Guid.Parse("d723dd8f-f4f4-e911-a81d-000d3af9eba2"));
req["Start"] = DateTime.Today.AddDays(1);
req["Duration"] = 60;
EntityCollection resourceAssignment = new EntityCollection();
var entity = new Entity();
entity["RequirementId"] = "";
entity["ResourceId"] = "";
entity["BookingStatusId"] = "";
resourceAssignment.Add(entity); 
req["ResourceAssignment"] = resourceAssignment;   

var response = osm.GetProxy().Execute(req); 
}  
```

## Example scenarios for migrating from the legacy scheduling API to Universal Resource Scheduling

The scenario-based examples in this section add more details about mapping from the legacy API to the new Universal Resource Scheduling API.   

### Scenario 1: Get two resources for each schedule proposal  

*The following screenshot from the legacy API is provided for reference in this scenario.*

![Legacy setup screenshot for reference for scenario 1](media/ur-scheduling-16-new.png "Legacy screenshot for reference for scenario 1")

1. Create one site (**Site1**), one user (**User1**), and one equipment resource (**Facility/Equipment** tab), with the name **Eq1**, with the site set to **Site1**. 

2. Create the business closure and work hours for the user (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM) and the equipment (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM). 

3. Create a new service (**Service1**), and then add **required resources** as **Choose 2** from User1, Eq1. Save and close the service.

![Schedule Service Activity screenshot for scenario 1](media/ur-scheduling-17-new.png "Service Activity screenshot for scenario 1")

4. Go to the homepage and schedule a service activity and then, select **Service1**, and then select **Schedule** > **Find available slots**. 

5. Verify that two resources are returned for each proposal in accordance with the criteria you set.  

#### Universal Resource Scheduling API code for scenario 1 

```csharp
void searchRequirementgroup(Microsoft.Pfe.Xrm.OrganizationServiceManager osm)
{ 
var req = new Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest() 
{ 
RequestName = "msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup"
};

  req["Version"] = "1.0.0"; 
  Entity requirementSpecification = new Entity();

  //Setting from date 

  requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_fromdate", DateTime.Parse("2019-12-  
  26T18:30:00.000Z"));

  //Setting to date 

  requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_todate", DateTime.Parse("2019-12- 
  27T18:29:00.000Z"));

  //Requirement group GUID 
  req["RequirementSpecification"] = requirementSpecification; 
  req["RequirementGroup"] = new   
  Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.EntityReference("msdyn_requirementgroup", Guid.Parse("XXXXXXXX"));

  //Executing the request and getting response
  var response = osm.GetProxy().Execute(req); 
  response.ToString(); 
  response.Dump();
} 	 
```

### Scenario 2: Verify that search results are correct for scheduling 

*The following screenshot from the legacy API is provided for reference in this scenario.* 

![Legacy setup screenshot for reference for scenario 2](media/ur-scheduling-18-new.png "Legacy setup screenshot for reference for scenario 2")

1. Create the following: 
  - Two sites: Micr0s0ftSite1 and Site2
  - Two users: User1 and User2 (Site2)
  - Go to **Settings**> **Service management** tab and create a site(with the name `Site1`), two resources on the **Facility/Equipment** tab (namely, Eq1 and Eq2) and go to setting> Security and create a user(User1). Two equipment resources on the **Facility/Equipment** tab<!--Is this correct for the UI string? --> (Eq1, Eq2), where Eq1 belongs to Site1 and Eq2 belongs to Site2
 
2. Create the business closure and work hours for the user (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM) and the equipment (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM). 

3. Create a new service with status **Reserved** and required resources as **Choose 2** from **same site** from User1, User2, Eq1, Eq2. Save and close the service. 

![Service Activity screenshot for scenario 2](media/ur-scheduling-19-new.png "Service Activity screenshot for scenario 2")

4. Go to the homepage > **Service Activity** > **Schedule**, and then select the service you created in step 3. Select the site as **Site1**, and then click on **Find available time**. 

5. Verify that the search results that are returned are correct for the site selected in the search criteria.

#### Universal Resource Scheduling API code for scenario 2

```csharp
void searchRequirementgroup(Microsoft.Pfe.Xrm.OrganizationServiceManager osm)
{
  var req = new Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest()
  {
  RequestName = "msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup"
  };
req["Version"] = "1.0.0"; 
Entity requirementSpecification = new Entity();

//Setting from date
requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_fromdate", DateTime.Parse("2019-12-26T18:30:00.000Z"));

//Setting to date
requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_todate", DateTime.Parse("2019-12-27T18:29:00.000Z")); 

//Setting up the Site as filter criteria for search.	      
requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_organizationalunit",Guid.Parse("XXXXXXXXXXXX")); 

req["RequirementSpecification"] = requirementSpecification;

//Requirement group GUID      
req["RequirementGroup"] = new EntityReference("msdyn_requirementgroup", Guid.Parse("XXXXXX"));

var response = osm.GetProxy().Execute(req);
response.ToString();
response.Dump();

}
```

### Scenario 3: Get proposed schedules that occur within the working hours for an equipment resource

![Legacy setup screenshot for reference for scenario 3](media/ur-scheduling-20-new.png "Legacy setup screenshot for reference for scenario 3")

1. Create two sites (Site1, Site2), and then create three equipment resources (Eq1, Eq2, Eq3). 

2. Create the business closure and work hours for all equipment (3:00 PM to 6:00 PM). 

3. Create a new service (**Service1**) Choose 1 from (Random) Eq1, Eq2, #q3.

![Service Activity screenshot for scenario 3](media/ur-scheduling-21-new.png "Service Activity screenshot for scenario 3")

4. In the **Schedule Service Activity** dialog box, search for proposals for Service1 by adding a required resource as **Eq1** for a specific date range. 

5. Verify that the proposed schedules that are returned occur within the working hours of the equipment for that date. 

#### Universal Resource Scheduling API code for scenario 3

```csharp
void searchRequirementgroup(Microsoft.Pfe.Xrm.OrganizationServiceManager osm)
{
var req = new Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest() 
{
RequestName = "msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup"
};
req["Version"] = "1.0.0"; 
Entity requirementSpecification = new Entity();

//Setting start date          
requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_fromdate", DateTime.Parse("2019-12-26T18:30:00.000Z"));
//Setting end date
requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_todate", DateTime.Parse("2019-12-27T18:29:00.000Z"));

//Setting the eq1 as required resource	 	

requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_resourcerequirementid",Guid.Parse("XXXXXX")); 
req["RequirementSpecification"] = requirementSpecification; 

//Setting the requirement group GUID
req["RequirementGroup"] = new EntityReference("msdyn_requirementgroup", Guid.Parse("XXXXX"));

//Executing the request and getting response. 
var response = osm.GetProxy().Execute(req); 
response.ToString(); 
response.Dump(); 
} 
```

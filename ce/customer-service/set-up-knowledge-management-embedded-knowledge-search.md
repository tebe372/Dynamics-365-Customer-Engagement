# Use embedded knowledge search to set up knowledge management

A comprehensive knowledge base is a key to increased customer satisfaction and improved productivity of users. Give users quick access to the knowledge base by setting up knowledge management in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Usage of [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../includes/pn-parature.md)] knowledgebase as a knowledge management solution has been deprecated. For more information, see [Important changes coming](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming).
  
After knowledge management is set up, users will be able to:  
  
- Search for relevant KB articles right from Dynamics 365 Customer Service as they're working on a record.  
  
- See the content of the KB article inline, including images and videos.  
  
- Give timely and consistent information to customers when working on their cases by using actions like opening the article and sharing the information or emailing the article link to customers.   

> [!NOTE]
> With the latest release of Dynamics 365 Customer Service app, embedded knowledge search in service management is available in the Customer Service Hub. We recommend that you set up knowledge management using embedded knowledge search in the new experience.

   - **URL Format**. Type the portal URL that will be used to create external (public-facing) portal links for knowledge articles, which the service agents can share with the customers. The external URL is created in the following format: 
        </br> </br> *https://\<support portal URL>/knowledgebase/article/{kbnum}*

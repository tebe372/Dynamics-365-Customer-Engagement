# Configure knowledge management

## Introduction

A comprehensive knowledge base is a key to increased customer satisfaction and improved productivity of users. Give users quick access to the knowledge base by setting up knowledge management in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Usage of [!INCLUDE[pn_parature](../includes/pn-parature.md)] knowledgebase as a knowledge management solution has been deprecated. For more information, see [Important changes coming](/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming).
  
After knowledge management is set up, users will be able to:  
  
- Search for relevant knowledge base articles from Customer Service while they're working on a record.  
  
- Set up the search logic, suggest as you type option, and search filters to get only the required knowledge articles, thereby providing timely and consistent information to customers while working on their cases.

- Use smart assist to receive AI suggestions on related knowledge articles and similar cases.

- See the content of the knowledge base article inline, including images and videos.

## Setup overview

You can set up knowledge management on the Customer Service admin center, Customer Service Hub, or manually for a model-driven app.

- [Set up knowledge management](#set-up-knowledge-management)
- [Set up knowledge management settings page manually for a model-driven app](#set-up-knowledge-management-settings-page-manually-for-a-model-driven-app)

After you have configured knowledge management on your app, you must also set up the various other aspects of knowledge management, based on your organizational requirements, such as:

- [Configure knowledge base article URLs](#configure-knowledge-base-article-urls)
- [Create and manage categories](create-manage-categories.md#create-and-manage-categories)
- [Knowledge article templates](create-templates-knowledge-article.md#knowledge-article-templates)
- [Set up AI suggestions for article keywords and description](#set-up-ai-suggestions-for-article-keywords-and-description)
- [Set up a search provider in Customer Service Hub](set-up-search-providers.md#set-up-a-search-provider-in-customer-service-hub)

## Set up knowledge management
  
[!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)] You must also be the tenant administrator of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)].

 You can set up knowledge management in the Customer Service admin center or Customer Service Hub app. The settings configured for knowledge management in the Customer Service Hub app are carried over to the Customer Service admin center app, and vice versa.

> [!NOTE]
> During the creation of knowledge articles, duplicate detection rules aren't supported on the Knowledge Article entity.

## Set up knowledge management settings page manually for a model-driven app

> [!NOTE]
> The embedded knowledge search control is deprecated in the web client. You must use the Knowledge Settings page in Unified Interface.

 If you are using the custom model-driven app, you need to manually update your sitemap with the Knowledge Settings page. To update the sitemap:
 
 1. Select your custom app.
 
 2. Select **Open in app designer**.
 
 3. Select **Site Map**.
  
 4. Select **Add > Subarea** to create a new sub area for your area.
 
 5. In the **Properties > SUB AREA** section, provide the following information:
    * Type: Select **URL**. 
    * URL: Enter  ```/main.aspx?pagetype=inlinedialog&name=KnowledgeSettings```

## Configure knowledge base article URLs

Knowledge articles can be configured with their portal URLs, and then agents can copy and share the URL links.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can configure knowledge articles with their own URLs, you must create a portal using your domain name. For information on how to create a portal, see [Create a portal in an environment containing customer engagement apps](/powerapps/maker/portals/create-dynamics-portal).

You can configure a knowledge base article URL in the Customer Service admin center or Customer Service Hub app by performing the following steps:

1. Go to the **Support portal connection** section.

### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)

  1. In the site map, select **Knowledge** in **Agent experience**. The **Knowledge** page appears.
  1. On the **Knowledge** page, go to the **Portal** section and select **Manage**. The **Portal** page appears.
  1. On the **Portal** page, go to the **Support portal connection** section.

### [Customer Service Hub](#tab/customerservicehub)

  1. In the site map, go to **Service Management** and select **Settings** in **Knowledge Base Management**.
  1. On the **Settings** page, go to the **Support portal connection** section.

---

2. Set the **Use an external portal** toggle to **Yes**.

3. In the **URL format** field, enter the URL name.

 4. Select **Save**.

The knowledge base article link is now active and can be copied and shared.

## Set up AI suggestions for article keywords and description

You can enable knowledge authors to get suggested keywords and description based on the article content stored in the built-in knowledge article entity. More information: [Configure AI suggestions for article keywords and description](configure-ai-suggested-article-keywords-description.md#configure-ai-suggestions-for-article-keywords-and-description).

## Set up knowledge search logic

If you have Dataverse search enabled, you can apply knowledge search logic for your knowledge articles to help agents find only the articles they need. By default, knowledge search works by the `searchMode=any` logic, which brings up articles that match any of the keywords used in your search. If you search for Contoso Coffee, the search results will show articles that have either "Contoso" or "Coffee", as seen in the following example:

- Article 1: Contoso machine repair
- Article 2: Coffee powder quality
- Article 3: Contoso coffee order price
- Article 4: Coffee machine order for Contoso
- Article 5: Espresso coffee machine troubleshooting

You can enable the knowledge search to work by the `searchmode=all` logic, which matches all the keywords that you used in the search. If you search for Contoso Coffee, the search results will show articles that match both "Contoso" and "Coffee", as seen in the following example:

- Article 1: Contoso coffee order price
- Article 2: Coffee machine order for Contoso

You can set up the knowledge search logic in the Customer Service admin center or Customer Service Hub app by performing the following steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** page.

### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)

  1. In the site map, select **Knowledge** in **Agent experience**.
  1. On the **Knowledge** page, in the **General settings** section, select **Manage**. The **General settings** page appears.

### [Customer Service Hub](#tab/customerservicehub)

  * In the site map, go to **Service Management** and select **Settings** in **Knowledge Base Management**. The **Settings** page appears.

---

2. In the **Knowledge search experience** section, set the **Set search mode as all** toggle to **Yes**.

3. Select **Save**.

More information: [Search across table data using Dataverse search](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/webapi/relevance-search#searchmode-any--all-optional)

## Enable suggest as you type

You can improve your agent's productivity by setting the **Enable suggest as you type** toggle to **Yes**, which provides suggestions on the most relevant records as agents type keywords into the Search box. Matching results start appearing inline to the search box. The matched text is highlighted to show the presence of the keyword. On selecting the record, the agent is directly taken to the record.

1. In the Customer Service admin center site map, select **Knowledge** in **Agent experience**.
2. On the **Knowledge** page, in the **General settings** section, select **Manage**. The **General settings** page appears.
3. In the **Knowledge search experience** section, set the **Enable suggest as you type** toggle to **Yes**.
4. Select **Save**.

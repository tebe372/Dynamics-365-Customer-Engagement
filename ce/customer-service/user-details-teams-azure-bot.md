If you integrate an Azure bot with the Microsoft Teams channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service, you may want to get user details. The Azure bot needs to use the Microsoft Graph SDK to fetch user details. For more information, refer to [Get user details with Microsoft Graph](/../../graph/tutorials/bot-framework.md?tutorial-step=4)

## Privacy notice

You understand that your data may be transmitted and shared with external systems and that your data may flow outside of your organization's compliance boundary (even if your organization is in a Government Cloud environment). For example, your messages will be shared with the bot which could be interacting with a third-party system based on the integration done by you. For more information on how we process your data, please refer to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

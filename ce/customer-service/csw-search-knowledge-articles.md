# Search for knowledge articles in Customer Service workspace

In Customer Service workspace, knowledge base search lets you search for relevant knowledge articles to resolve a case. The knowledge area is available on the productivity pane.

## Prerequisites

- The productivity pane and knowledge search must be enabled in the app profile manager.
- The anchor tab should be a case or conversation for the knowledge search pane to be displayed.
- Dataverse search must be enabled.

The knowledge base search uses the dataverse search mechanism in the knowledge base search control area. More information: [Knowledge base search control powered by Dataverse search](search-knowledge-articles-csh.md#knowledge-base-search-control-powered-by-dataverse-search). Before you begin using dataverse search, your administrator must configure certain view columns in the Quick Find view columns list. More information: [Before you begin using Dataverse Search](search-knowledge-articles-csh.md#before-you-begin-using-dataverse-search).

## Use the knowledge search pane to search articles

In Customer Service workspace, for a case, when you select the Knowledge Search tab, knowledge articles that match the case title are displayed on the **Knowledge search** pane. These articles are displayed based on relevance and full-text search mechanisms.

The knowledge articles are applicable for all knowledge-enabled entities. By default, the full-text search displays 10 results and Dataverse search displays 50 results. You can also use the search box to enter keywords and search for articles if those displayed by default are not relevant.

## Use the knowledge search pane to work on your articles

You can also perform the following actions on your knowledge article from the **Knowledge search** pane.

### View the knowledge article on the application tab

Select an article title to view the article on an application tab. You can view up to 10 articles on the application tab.

You can perform the following actions for the knowledge article:

- Copy URL to copy the external URL of the article so you can share it with your customers over channels like chat or email.
- Provide feedback by selecting the thumbs up or thumbs down icon.
  - Make sure that the knowledge article entity is enabled for feedback. To learn more, see [Enable an entity for feedback/ratings](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/enable-entity-feedback).
  - Customer service agents and customer service managers can create, or view feedback based on their role and privileges on feedback entity. Out of the box, customer service agents can create, view, or edit their own feedback only. Customer service managers or knowledge managers can view feedback submitted by all agents.
- When you select thumbs down, the **Comments** box to provide feedback appears. Optionally, provide additional information and reasons for the feedback.

### Filter knowledge articles

With the help of text and visual filters, you can filter the knowledge articles.

For example, there are a total of 50 articles in five different languages such as French, English, Japanese, Spanish, and Danish. The language filter will show only these five languages. |

# Search for knowledge articles

In Customer Service workspace, knowledge base search lets you search for relevant knowledge articles to resolve a case. The knowledge area is available on the productivity pane.

## Prerequisites

- The productivity pane and knowledge search must be enabled in app profile manager.
- The anchor tab should be a case or conversation for the knowledge pane to be displayed.

## Use the knowledge pane to search articles

In Customer Service workspace, for a case, when you select the knowledge tab, knowledge articles that match the case title are displayed on the **Knowledge** pane. These articles are displayed based on relevance and full-text search mechanisms.

The knowledge articles are applicable for all knowledge-enabled entities.

By default, the full text search displays 10 results and relevance search displays 50 results.

You can filter search results to see all draft, published, or approved articles. See articles that are categorized as internal and external. You can also filter the articles based on date and language.

When you select the filter icon, you can see the **Filter by** menu where you can filter the items based on the following categories.

## How knowledge base search powered by relevance search works

The knowledge base search is enabled to use the relevance search mechanism in the knowledge base search control area.

[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [How relevance search works](/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization)

The relevance search mechanism uses Azure search service to index and search records. Relevance search provides improved search functionality, such as better relevance, highlighted search keyword text, and search within attachments and notes. With relevance search, you can also configure search fields in the knowledge article entity.

[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Configure searchable fields for Relevance Search](/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization)

> [!NOTE]
> To enable relevance search for knowledge article entity, see [Enable relevance search](/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization) and [Select entities for Relevance Search](/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization).</br>
If relevance search is not enabled for the entity, standard full-text search is used.

For more information, see [Understand knowledge base search mechanisms](knowledge-base-search-methods.md).

### Before you begin using relevance search

Relevance search uses the scoring concepts as defined by Azure search. To be able to search the knowledge base using relevance search, certain view columns should be mandatorily configured in the Quick Find view columns list. If any of these columns are deleted or missing, the search query will display an error.

> [!NOTE]
> An admin can configure the knowledge article quick find view columns list by navigating to **Settings > Customizations > Entities > Knowledge Article > Views > Quick Find View > View Columns**.

The required view columns are as follows:

- Article Public Number
- Title
- Created On
- Keywords
- Knowledge Article Views
- Language
- Major Version Number
- Minor Version Number
- Rating
- Status
- Modified On
- Content

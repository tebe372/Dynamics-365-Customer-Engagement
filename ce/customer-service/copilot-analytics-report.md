# View copilot analytics report


Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service helps agents to complete tasks related to conversations, cases, and email more easily. With the Copilot report in Customer Service historical analytics, supervisors and customer service managers can identify the impact that Copilot is having across their customer service operation.

To view the Copilot report, open Customer Service historical analytics and select the **Copilot** tab.

## Copilot report

You can use filters to focus on the information that's important to you:

- **Duration**: Filters the data by the selected value of day, week, or month.
- **Time zone**: Filters the data for the selected time zone.

The Copilot report displays the following metrics.

# View agent dashboard and agent conversations

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

When you sign in to the Omnichannel for Customer Service app, the Omnichannel Agent Dashboard is the default view. You can set any dashboard as the default view by selecting the **Set As Default** option. The dashboard displays the following streams:

- My work items
- Open work items
- Closed work items

## My work items

In the **My work items** section, you can see the conversations (work items) that you are actively working on. Select the ellipses and select the **Open** option to open the work item in a session.

## Open work items

In the **Open work items** section, you can see the conversations (work items) that are in an open state from all queues in which you are added as a member. Select the ellipses and select the **Assign to me** option to assign the work item to yourself. When you select a work item, you get a notification, and when you accept it, a session starts and customer summary or case page loads.

The work item that you pick is moved from the **Open work items** section to the **My work items** section. If you reject the request, then the work item remains in the **Open work items** section.

## Closed work items

In the **Closed work items** section, you can see all the conversations that you've closed on the same day. To view a closed work item, select the ellipsis button (**...**) for it, and then select **Open** to view the details.

When you open a record from the **Closed work items** section, you can view the attributes of the closed conversation record. This will not re-open or re-activate the conversation.

## Sort work items

On the dashboard, you can sort the work items by the following categories:

- Modified On
- Work distribution mode (For open work items only)
- Customer
- Work stream
- Created On
- Transfer Count

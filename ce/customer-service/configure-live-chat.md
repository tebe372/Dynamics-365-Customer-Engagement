# Quickly configure a chat widget

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Use the Omnichannel admin center app to quickly configure and add a chat widget to your portal to chat with your website visitors. To configure a chat widget and embed it in portal, you must:

## Step 1: Create a workstream for chat

1. Sign in to Dynamics 365, and open the Omnichannel Admin center app.
2. In the site map, go to **Workstreams** in **General Settings**, and select **New** from the command bar.
3. On the **Create a workstream** dialog box, do the following:
   
   - **Name**: Specify a workstream name
   - **Work distribution mode**: Select **Push** or **Pick**.
   - **Type**: Select **Messaging**.
   - **Channel**: Select **Chat**.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![New work stream.](media/omnichannel-new-workstream.png)

4. Select **Create**.

## Step 2: Configure a chat widget

1. On the workstream page that you created, select **Set up chat**.
2. On the **Live chat setup** wizard that appears, enter the details. More information: [Configure a chat widget in Omnichannel admin center](add-chat-widget.md#configure-a-chat-widget-in-omnichannel-admin-center).

## Step 3: Embed chat widget in portal

> [!NOTE]
> The chat widget requires session storage and local storage to be functional in your customersâ€™ browsers. Make sure to notify your customers to enable cookies in their browsers so these services can work properly.

Follow these steps to embed your chat widget into a Power Apps portal. For steps to embed your chat widget into your website, see [Embed chat widget in your website or Power Apps portal](embed-chat-widget-portal.md). For steps to embed your chat widget into mobile experiences, see [Render a live chat widget on the mobile app](render-live-chat-widget-mobile.md).

1.	[Open the Portal Management app](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-portal).
2.	Go to **Portal** > **Content Snippets**.
3.	Find the **Chat Widget Code** content snippet and open it.
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Go to Chat Widget Code content snippet in portal.](media/portal-content-snippet.png "Go to Chat Widget Code content snippet in portal")
4.	On the **General** tab, scroll down to the **Value (HTML)** section.
5.	Paste the chat widget snippet code in the **HTML** tab.
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Paste code snippet of a chat widget.](media/paste-snippet.png "Paste code snippet of a chat widget")
6.	Save the changes. The chat widget is now embedded into the portal. By default, the chat widget is displayed in minimized mode as follows:

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Chat widget in minimized mode.](media/oc-chat-widget-minimized-mode.png "Chat widget in minimized mode")
    
You can maximize the chat widget by selecting it.

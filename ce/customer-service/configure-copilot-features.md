## Enable summarization of conversations

Copilot case summaries are designed to help support agents quickly understand the context of a case, enabling them to resolve customer issues more efficiently. Agents get a concise summary of the case, which includes key information such as the case title, customer, case subject, product, priority, case type, and case description.

To allow Copilot to summarize conversations, perform the following steps:

1.	In Customer Service admin center select **Productivity** in Agent Experience.
2.	In **Productivity**, select **Manage**  in **Copilot help pane (preview)**.
1. Select **Make case summaries available to agents** to display a summary of the case to on the Case page. 
1. Select the following options to define when you want the conversations to be summarized:
   - **When an agent joins the conversation**: To display the conversation summary when an agent has joined the conversation. This is applicable to conversations escalated to a human agent from a bot, transferred conversations, or when the agent invites a collaborator.
   - **When the conversation ends**: To display the summary when the conversation ends.
   - **Allow agents to create a case with a button in the summary**: To display the **Create Case** button in the summary generated when an agent ends the conversation.
   - **On demand, by selecting a button to summarize the conversation**: To display the conversation summary when an agent selects the summarize button on the conversation.
  
   > [!NOTE]

### Record feedback

In the corresponding Copilot configuration pages, you can select **Record transcripts of agent interaction with Copilot, agent actions, and agent feedback on AI suggestions** to record how agents are interacting with Copilot and understand its impact. Agents can share feedback about Copilot actions. This helps Copilot perform better. You can use the data to analyze knowledge sources, and also build usage reports.

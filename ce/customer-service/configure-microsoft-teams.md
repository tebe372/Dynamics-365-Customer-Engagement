# Configure a Microsoft Teams channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Microsoft Teams channel

Using Microsoft Teams as an engagement channel for support of internal functions&mdash;such as technical support, human resources, and finance&mdash;allows organizations to connect their employees with internal support personnel by using the Omnichannel Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Teams is provisioned in your environment. More information: [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](omnichannel-provision-license.md)

  > [!NOTE]
  > To enable the Teams channel in an existing Omnichannel for Customer Service environment, you must upgrade to the latest version of Omnichannel for Customer Service. More information: [Upgrade Omnichannel for Customer Service](upgrade-omnichannel.md)

- An app is created and configured in **Teams** > **App Studio**.

### Modify settings for a specific Teams account

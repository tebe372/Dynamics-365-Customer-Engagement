This article contains information on frequently asked questions about the create record automatically and activity monitor features in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

## What are the scenarios in which the rule skips from creating records automatically?

Some of the scenarios in which the automatically create records rule skips from creating records are explained as follows:

### Reason 1

Email is from an unknown sender.

**Resolution**: On the **Advanced** tab of the **Record creation and update rule** page, select **Yes** for **Allow emails from unknown senders**, and choose an option in **Manage unknown senders by** according to your business needs. More information: [Configure advanced settings for rules](automatically-create-update-records.md#configure-advanced-settings-for-rules).

### Reason 2

A resolved case is already connected with this record.

**Resolution**: On the **Advanced** tab of the **Record creation and update rule** page, select **Yes** for **Wait for a specific amount of time after the connected case has been resolved**, and specify the time in the **Select the amount of time** option. More information: [Configure advanced settings for rules](automatically-create-update-records.md#configure-advanced-settings-for-rules).

### Reason 3

No valid entitlement for this email sender.

**Resolution**: On the **Advanced** tab of the **Record creation and update rule** page, select **No** for **Require a valid entitlement on the connect case**.

### Reason 4

No applicable reason can be specified.

**Resolution**: If the reason is empty and the state says **Ready for workflow/Power automate**, and the case doesn't get created, then check system jobs if it's a legacy rule, or check flow runs if it's a modern rule.

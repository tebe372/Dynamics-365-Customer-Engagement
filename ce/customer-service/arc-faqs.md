### Reason 2

A resolved case is already connected with this record.

**Resolution**: On the **Advanced** tab of the **Record creation and update rule** page, select **Yes** for **Wait for a specific amount of time after the connected case has been resolved**, and specify the time in the **Select the amount of time** option. More information: [Configure advanced settings for rules](automatically-create-update-records.md#configure-advanced-settings-for-rules).

### Reason 3

No valid entitlement for this email sender.

**Resolution**: On the **Advanced** tab of the **Record creation and update rule** page, select **No** for **Require a valid entitlement on the connect case**.

### Reason 4

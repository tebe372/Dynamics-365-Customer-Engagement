To protect an agent's privacy, you can configure your chat widget to display either the full name, first name, last name, or nickname of the agent to the customers. If you'd like to hide your agentâ€™s identity and anonymize, choose to display the nickname. The values for the names are retrieved from the user record created in Omnichannel for Customer Service. For information on creating users, see [Create users in model-driven applications and assign security roles](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles). You can add nickname of a user in the Omnichannel user record in Web Client.

> [!NOTE]
> The selected agent's name is displayed in the chat widget only while the agent is chatting with a customer. For consultation or chat transfer, the full name of the agent is used.

1. In Customer Service admin center, go to the workstream of the chat widget in which you need to configure the settings, select edit for the required chat widget, and on the **Chat channel Settings** page, go to the **Chat widget** tab.

1. In the **Agent display name** field, select one of the following options:

    - **Full name:** Full name of the agent.

    - **First name:** First name of the agent. By default, first name is selected.

    - **Last name:** Last name of the agent.

    - **Nick name:** Nickname of the agent. If a nickname is not available in the user record, the full name is displayed to the customers.

1. Select **Save**.

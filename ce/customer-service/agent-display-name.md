# Configure agent display name

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

To protect an agent's privacy, you can configure your chat widget to display either full name, first name, last name, or nickname of an agent to the customers. If you would like to hide your agentâ€™s identity and anonymize, choose to display the nickname. The values for the names are retrieved from the user entity record created in Omnichannel for Customer Service. For information on creating users, see [Create users in model-driven applications and assign security roles](../admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles.md). You can add nickname of a user in the Omnichannel user record in Web Client.

> [!NOTE]
> The selected agent display name is displayed only in the chat widget while chatting with a customer. For consultation or chat transfer, full name of the agent is used.

1. Do one of the following depending on the app you're using:
   - In Omnichannel admin center, go to the workstream of the chat widget in which you need to configure the settings, select edit for the required chat widget, and on the **Chat channel Settings** page, go to the **Chat widget** tab.
   - In Omnichannel Administration, go to **Channels** &gt; **Chat**, open the chat widget in which you need to configure the settings, and select the **General settings** tab.

2. In the **Agent display name** field, select one of the following:

    - **Full name**: Full name of the agent.

    - **First name**: First name of the agent. By default, first name is selected.

    - **Last name**: Last name of the agent.

    - **Nick name**: Nickname of the agent. If a nickname is not available in the user record, the full name is displayed to the customers.

3.	Select **Save**.

# User Guide (Customer Service Hub)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Empower your agents to work smarter and faster with a modern, interactive experience tailored to their role.

The Customer Service Hub in Microsoft Dynamics 365 is optimized for the Customer service module. It is a focused, interactive interface, designed to simplify your day-to-day job. It shows you all your vital information in one place, and lets you focus on the key activities that require your attention.

Customer Service Hub is based on the Unified Interface framework. Some of the key highlights are:

- Seamless and intuitive user interface
- UI reflow and adaptivity across devices and form factors

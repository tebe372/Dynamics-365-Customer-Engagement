Agents can collaborate with others directly in Teams while they're working in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. To help them easily recap an ongoing customer interaction, turn on AI-generated conversation summaries. Agents can include a summary when they link a case to a Teams chat or channel. The summary quickly provides context and relays any steps they've already taken.

## Components of an AI-generated conversation summary

The conversation summary feature uses an AI natural language model to summarize a transcript of an active conversation. Summaries are limited to the first 7,000 characters of a transcript.

A summary includes the following components:

- **Issue description** summarizes the key customer problems to solve in a conversation. The model needs at least three customer messages to generate the issue description.

- **Resolution tried** summarizes any troubleshooting steps or possible solutions that agents have tried. If the model can't identify a resolution from the transcript, this section is blank.

## Regional availability and supported languages

AI-generated conversation summary is available in the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom.

This feature is supported only in English.

For more information, see [Regional availability and service limits for Customer Service](cs-region-availability-service-limits.md).

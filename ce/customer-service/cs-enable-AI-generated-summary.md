Agents can collaborate with other agents and contacts directly while they're working in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. To help agents easily recap an ongoing customer interaction, turn on auto-summarization for conversations. Agents can generate a conversation summary when they either transfer a conversation, add a user to consult, or start a linked Teams chat. The summary quickly provides context and relays any steps they've already taken.
> [!NOTE]
>  - Auto-summarization for conversations is in preview for messaging channels and voice conversations with transcription enabled.
>  - This feature is generally available for Microsoft Teams conversations.

## Components of an auto-summarize conversations (preview)

The conversation summary feature uses an AI natural language model to summarize a transcript of an active conversation. Summaries are limited to the first 7,000 characters of a transcript.

A summary includes the following components:

- **Issue description**: Summarizes the key customer problems to solve in a conversation. The model needs at least three customer messages to generate the issue description.

- **Resolution tried**: Summarizes any troubleshooting steps or possible solutions that agents have tried. If the model can't identify a resolution from the transcript, this section is blank. If the case is resolved or the conversation ends, the application displays this label as **Resolution**.

## Regional availability and supported languages

The auto-summarization of conversations is available in the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom.

This feature is supported only in English.

# SLA limitations

The following limitations apply to SLAs created in the Unified Interface apps:

- The **Applicable When** and **Success Conditions** won't work as expected if they're configured for related entities.

    - The **Applicable When** conditions, if defined on the related entity, will work only for the first time when the conditions are met, and the KPI instance will be set to **In Progress**. After that, any update to the related entity won't cancel the existing KPI instance if the conditions of the same SLA item are false. The update will also not create a new KPI instance if there's a change in the SLA item.
    - The **Success Conditions** defined on the related entity will never be true and the KPI instance once set to **In Progress** will never succeed, even if conditions are met. It will continue to be in **In Progress**, **Nearing NonCompliance**, or **Noncompliant** status.

    To use related entities, you can add the related attribute values to the parent entity.
    
- Multiple SLA items can't be defined with the same **Applicable When** criteria and KPI.
- You can’t use nested related entities with the **Under** or **Not Under** operator as part of the conditions for SLAs. So, you'll need to change the **Applicable When**, **Success**, and **Pause** conditions to add one level of related entities only with the **Under** or **Not Under** operator.
- You can’t directly use the **Under** or **Not-Under** operator as conditions when configuring **Applicable When** or **Success** conditions for SLA items, so use related entities when using the **Under** or **Not Under** operator.
- You need to avoid using the **Modified On** field in the target entity as part of **Applicable When** or **Success** conditions of SLA items or as the **Applicable From** field of SLA KPI instances. Changes to the **Modified On** field in the target entity might not initiate SLAs and might result in incorrect updates to SLA KPI instances.

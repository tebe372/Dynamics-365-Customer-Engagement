# Customize the Customer summary form

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

You can customize the following for the **Customer summary** page:

- Add or remove custom controls
- Add a web resource or iFrame to the form
- Customize the layout

> [!NOTE]
> However, for a conversation entity, you can't add custom fields, forms, or views.

By default, the **Customer summary** page displays the sections that are listed in this topic. For information on how to customize these sections, see [Customize quick view forms](customize-quick-view-form.md).

## Customer profile

The **Customer profile** section provides details about the customer or account. These details include the name of the customer or account, category or job, title, relationship type, city, and the preferred channel of engagement. You can modify the quick view forms in this section by navigating to the respective entity forms. 

## Conversation summary

The **Conversation summary** section fetches details based on the context of the incoming conversation request.

This section includes **Pre-chat survey** and **Visitor details**. The details on these tabs help you to understand contextual channel-specific information about the conversation with the customer. The **Pre-chat survey** tab shows responses from the customer on the pre-chat questions.

The **Visitor details** tab provides some information such as the customer is authenticated or not, browser used by the customer for contacting support, an operating system used by the customer, location of the customer, interacting language of the customer, and so on. In addition, conversation and transfer details.

If the customer signs in to the portal to initiate a chat with the support, then as an agent, you can see the **Authenticated** field value as **Yes** in the **Visitor details** tab of the **Conversation summary** section. Otherwise, the **Authenticated** field value is shown as **No**.

## Issue snapshot

For an incoming conversation request, the system links an existing case to the conversation and shows it on the **Issue Snapshot** section. This section shows information such as the title of the case, the priority, the status of the case, the product, and the owner. You can modify the quick view forms in this section by navigating to the respective entity forms.

## Recent cases

This form section displays the recent cases that relate to the customer. You can modify the quick view forms in this section by navigating to the respective entity forms.

## Timeline

This section displays case-related and customer-related activities in the form of a timeline. You can create quick notes based on the discussion with the customer. Use the **Linked records** field to switch the timeline based on the Case, Contact, or Account record linked to the conversation.

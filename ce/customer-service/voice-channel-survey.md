Post call surveys help measure customer satisfaction in the contact center.Â  Surveys are also an incentive for agents to provide high quality service. Having the survey right after the call provides the customer the opportunity to offer feedback while it is fresh in their minds.

Automatic
The IVR bot informs the customer about a post-call survey at the end of the call. 
After the agent disconnects, the call is automatically transferred to a post-call survey bot.

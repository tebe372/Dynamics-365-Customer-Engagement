# lcw:onMessageReceived  (Omnichannel for Customer Service JavaScript API reference)

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

This event is triggered when a new message is received by the chat widget. You can use this event to create custom experiences when a new message comes in for the user. For example, playing a sound notification or updating the page title to catch the userâ€™s eye. 

The message can either be sent by a user (for example, an agent in Dynamics) or the system (for example, an automated message), so the possible values for messageType are "user" and "system". This event will contain data in the payload to explain the source of the message. 

## Sample payload

```JSON
{ 

detail: { 

messageType: "user" 

} 

} 
```

## Example

```javascript
window.addEventListener("lcw:onMessageReceived", function handleWidgetMessageReceivedEvent(payload){ // Handle the live chat widget message sent event });
```

# Bot sessions and licensing

A bot session is defined as a conversation in which a bot is invoked. The bot can be invoked at the beginning, during, or end of a conversation.

- If two different bots are invoked in the same conversation, it is considered a single conversation.
- A conversation with a bot that's escalated to a human agent is considered a bot conversation.

The add-in applications such as Chat, Digital Messaging, and Voice channel are licensed per user. See the [Licensing](system-requirements-omnichannel.md#licensing) section that includes information on the required subscriptions to use the chat and voice channels. 

For more information on licenses and pricing, see the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544).

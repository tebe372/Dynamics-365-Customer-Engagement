# Add search providers

With Integrated search provider, you can configure external data sourcesproviders such as enterprise websites based on the site map protocol. After configuring, the articles from the external providers will be ingested into Microsoft Dataverse, so that agents can view a consolidated list of knowledge article search results and experience a single ranking of articles across data search sourcesproviders. You must add your search providers through using the Integrated search provider providers option from the Customer Service admin center app.

## Prerequisites
- You must prepare the metadata mapping schema file, with your article properties, to be able to validate the knowledge article schema.More information: Develop metadata mapping schema 
- If your website is registered using Azure Active Directory, youâ€™ll need to use OAuth, and provide the Resource Id, Tenant Id, Client Id, and the Client secret generated from the AAD Application registration page. More information: Apply authentication

## Add integrated search providers

2.	In the **Integrated search providers** section, select **Manage**.
3.	Select **New**.
4.	On the **Add an integrated search provider** page, do the following:
    1. In the **Provider info** section, enter the following information:
        1. **Search provider name**: Enter the name of the search provider.
        1. **Description**: Enter the description of the search provider.
The **Data source** and **Owner** are auto filled.
        1. Select the authorization check box.
        1. Select **Next**.
    1.	In the **Authentication** section, enter the following information:
        1. **URL**: Provide the root URL of the website along with the protocol (http:// or https://)
        1. **Sitemap URL**: Provide the sitemap URL of the source website.
        1. **Authentication type**: Select **None** or **OAuth** from the dropdown list. If you select **OAuth**, provide the **Resource Id**, **Tenant Id**, **Client Id**, and the **Client secret** generated on the AAD Application registration page. More information: Apply authentication.
        1. Select **Test connection**. You will get a confirmation message that states whether the test connection has passed or failed. In case of an error message, check and correct the details provided.
        1. Select **Next**.
    1.	In the **Knowledge article schema** section, validate the knowledge article schema by copying and pasting your article properties and schema JSON in the field provided to you. More information: Develop metadata mapping schema for knowledge articles. Refer to Appendix: Sample metadata mapping template an example.
       1. Select **Validate json**. You will get a message to denote whether the Json validation has passed or failed. In case of an error, the error message will state the parameter with the incorrect value.
       1. Select **Next**.
    1.	In the **Refresh schedule** section, specify the refresh intervals:
        1. **Refresh frequency**: Select between 15mnts and 7days from the dropdown. Your selection specifies the frequency at which newly created or updated articles will be ingested from the external search provider.
        1. **Lookback period**: Select between 2hrs and 8hrs from the dropdown list. Your selection specifies the additional time period for which the articles would be ingested that might have been missed during syncing and ingestion.
        For example, if you set the **Refresh frequency** at 15mnts and Lookback period at 2hrs, your data will be refreshed for the last 2hrs and 15mnts, in every 15mnts. 
        1.	Select **Next**.

    1.	Select **Save and close**.

In case of an error, save will fail and you will see a notification. You need to correct the error and try saving the search provider again.

However, customers with billing locations in United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Puerto Rico are the only ones who can use Microsoft as a carrier. Other customers can select a different carrier using certified Session Border Controllers (SBCs). More information: [Azure direct routing certified Session Border Controllers&mdash;Azure Communication Services](/azure/communication-services/concepts/telephony/certified-session-border-controllers)
> - <sup>**2**</sup>  Microsoft as a carrier is available only in specific billing postal codes, however bring your own carrier via Azure direct routing is supported everywhere using certified SBCs. More information: Azure direct routing certified Session Border Controllers&mdash;Azure Communication Services. Though Azure direct routing is in public preview everywhere, it will provide generally available level of support for Dynamics 365 customers where the voice channel is generally available in the region. Country-specific cloud deployments for the voice channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service are excluded, you must use the general region deployment. For example, in the preceding table, country cloud for  local deployment in United Kingdom is **"To be announced"** and is not part of the Europe geographical region availability. If you want your data to stay within the country, you'll need to wait for country-specific local deployment of the voice channel.

## Language limitations by feature

### What languages are supported in the voice channel at general availability

For our GA release of voice channel, language support is feature-specific.

We use Azure Cognitive Service Speechâ€™s speech-to-text for transcription, so we plan on supporting all of the languages that speech-to-text supports today. Power Virtual Agents is available only for a subset of languages, so for Power Virtual Agents-based IVR, we will support the languages that Power Virtual Agents supports. We also support a bring-your-own bot through Azure Bot Service for IVR that will be constrained by the languages that speech-to-text supports. For AI suggestions, we have added more languages as of April 2021.

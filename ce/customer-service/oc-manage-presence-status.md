[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Presence is an indication of your availability or status in the application.

## Prerequisites

For the presence status or presence icon to display correctly, enable in your browser for all modes.

## View your presence status

You can view your presence status on the navigation bar. You can select the presence icon to launch the presence dialog and update your presence.

- ![Offline presence status.](media/oceh-offline-icon.png "Offline presence status")  Offline

- ![Appear away presence status.](media/oceh-appear-away-icon.png "Appear away presence status")  Appear away

- ![Do not disturb presence status.](media/oceh-do-not-disturb-icon.png "Do not disturb presence status")  Do not disturb

- ![Busy presence status.](media/oceh-busy-icon.png "Busy presence status")  Busy

- ![Available presence status.](media/oceh-available-icon.png "Available presence status")  Available
  
- ![Inactive presence status.](media/oceh-appear-away-icon.png "Appear away presence status")  Inactive
  
## Update your presence status

You can update the presence status in the following two ways:

- **Manually**: To view and set the presence manually based on your availability, select the presence icon on the navigation bar. In the **Set Your Presence Status** dialog, select a status from the list. The list shows the following standard presence statuses:

  - Offline
  - Appear away
  - Do not disturb
  - Busy
  - Available
  
   You might also see other presence statuses that your administrator configured for you.

- **Automatically**: When a conversation (work item) is assigned to you, Omnichannel for Customer Service sets your presence status based on your capacity as follows:

  - When your capacity is fully utilized, then Omnichannel for Customer Service sets your presence to **Do not disturb**.
  - When your capacity is partially utilized, then Omnichannel for Customer Service sets your presence to **Busy**.
  - When your capacity isn't utilized, then Omnichannel for Customer Service sets your presence to **Available**.
  - If you already have 10 sessions open, which is the maximum multisession limit, and a new work item comes in, then Omnichannel for Customer Service changes your presence to **Do not disturb**.
  - When you miss a notification and the missed notifications setting is enabled, then the presence changes to **Inactive**.
  - When you reject a work notification and the agent reject notification setting is enabled, then the presence changes to **Do not disturb**.

## Presence status conditions

Your presence status pertains to the following conditions:

- Omnichannel for Customer Service determines your presence based on your used or released capacity. The presence changes from **Available** to **Busy**, **Busy** to **Do not disturb**, **Do not disturb** to **Busy**, or **Busy** to **Available**.

- If your presence is **Away** or **Offline**, then Omnichannel for Customer Service doesn't update the presence. But, you can manually change it.

- If you change your presence to **Do not disturb**, then Omnichannel for Customer Service doesn't update the presence. But, you can manually change it.

- If you are inactive or signed out due to any reason, the system will clear your presence status and recalculate a fresh status when you resume your work or sign in again.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The system waits for 2.5 minutes after which the agent is considered as inactive and will be marked as offline when the agent does any of the following actions:
  >
  > - Closes the browser
  > - Signs out of Customer Service workspace
  > - Closes or signs out of the device
  > - Disruption to Internet
  > - Minimizes the browser
  > - Leaves the browser open without any activity

## Presence status scenarios

The following scenarios describe how your presence status can change while you work with your customers.

- **Reconnect**: When the connection is lost because of network issues, or when you refresh the browser and connect back, then Omnichannel for Customer Service picks up your last known presence. 

- **Sign in**: When you sign in, your presence is set to the default presence if no work items have been assigned to you. If work items have been assigned, then your presence is automatically determined. However, if your default presence status is Away or Offline, then Omnichannel for Customer Service doesn’t change your presence.  

- **Accept work items**: When you accept a work item or it's assigned automatically, then Omnichannel for Customer Service  determines your presence based on your work capacity. But, if your presence status is Away or Offline, or if you've manually changed your presence to Do not disturb, then Omnichannel for Customer Service doesn’t change your presence. 

- **Close work items**: When you close a session, or resolve, cancel, or reroute a case, then Omnichannel for Customer Service determines your presence based on your work capacity. But, if your presence status Away or Offline, or if you've manually changed your presence to Do not disturb, then Omnichannel for Customer Service doesn’t change your presence.

- **Reset agent presence**: When your presence is based on the missed notification or the agent reject notification, then Omnichannel for Customer Service determines your presence based on your work capacity.

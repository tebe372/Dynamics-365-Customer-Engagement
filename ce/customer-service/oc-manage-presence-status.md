# Manage presence status

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Presence is the indication of your availability or status.

  > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
  > ![Agent presence status.](media/oceh-presence-icon.png "Agent presence status")

## View your presence status

As an agent, you can view your presence status that is shown in the nav bar. Select the icon to launch the presence dialog. Each presence status is indicated by an icon:

  - ![Offline presence status.](media/oceh-offline-icon.png "Offline presence status") - Offline

  - ![Appear away presence status.](media/oceh-appear-away-icon.png "Appear away presence status") - Appear away

  - ![Do not disturb presence status.](media/oceh-do-not-disturb-icon.png "Do not disturb presence status") - Do not disturb

  - ![Busy presence status.](media/oceh-busy-icon.png "Busy presence status") - Busy

  - ![Available presence status.](media/oceh-available-icon.png "Available presence status") - Available
  
  - ![Inactive presence status.](media/oceh-appear-away-icon.png "Appear away presence status") - Inactive
  
If you can't see your presence status, make sure that cookies are not blocked in your browser in any mode.
 
## Update your presence status

Presence status is updated in two ways:
- **Manually** - Change the status manually according to your availability.<br> To view and set the presence, select the presence icon from the nav bar and then select the status from the list. The list shows five standard presence statuses:

  - Offline
  - Appear away
  - Do not disturb
  - Busy
  - Available
  
   You might also see other additional presence statuses that your administrator configured for you.

  > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
  > ![Set your status.](media/oceh-presence.png "Set your status")

- **Automatically** - The status is set automatically based on the work item assignment. That is, when a conversation (work item) is assigned to you, the status is updated based on the capacity as follows:

  - When your capacity is fully utilized, the presence is set to **Do not disturb**.
  - When your capacity is partially utilized, the presence is set to **Busy**.
  - When your capacity is not utilized, the presence is set to **Available**.
  - When you miss a notification and the missed notifications setting is enabled, the presence is set to **Inactive**.
  - When you reject a work notification and the agent reject notification setting is enabled, the presence is set to **Do not disturb**.

# Provision unified routing for Customer Service

## Introduction

Perform the steps mentioned in this topic to provision unified routing in Customer Service. By default, unified routing is not enabled.

## Provision unified routing for only Customer Service

To provision unified routing in Customer Service, do the following:

1. In Dynamics 365, go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.
   
   ### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)

   - In the site map, select **Routing**. The **Routing** page appears.

   ### [Customer Service Hub](#tab/customerservicehub)

   - Go to the **Service Management** site map, and select **Service Configuration Settings** in **Service Terms**. The **Service Configuration Settings** page appears.


1. If consent is already provided by the tenant administrator, go to step 5.

    If consent to access is not provided by the tenant administrator, in the **Unified routing** section, the following message with a link to the consent page is displayed:

      "Unified routing requires application permissions. A tenant administrator must provide consent before it can be turned on. Provide consent."

1. Select **Provide consent**. The following consent form is displayed on a new tab.

    > ![Consent to allow access to data.](media/data-consent.png "Consent to allow access to data")

    For information on consent, see [Consent to access data to provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](data-access-consent.md)

1. Select **Consent on behalf of your organization**, and select **Accept**.

1. After access is granted, you can close the page to return to the **Service Configuration Settings** page.

1. Set the toggle to **Yes** for **Turn on unified routing**. A message that unified routing is being provisioned appears.

After unified routing is provisioned, **Unified Routing** appears in the site map.

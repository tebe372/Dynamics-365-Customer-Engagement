# Create workstream for record routing

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

You can configure settings for record routing in Customer Service Hub, Omnichannel admin center, or Omnichannel Administration.

## Prerequisites

To route entity records, you must enable entity for routing using entity records channel configuration. To learn more [Entity records routing](entity-channel.md#step-2-enable-entity-for-activities-and-queues).

For configuring unified routing, make sure that the toggle for unified routing is set to yes in the **Service Configuration Settings** section of Customer Service Hub.

## Configure record routing in Omnichannel admin center or Customer Service Hub

Perform the following steps to configure record routing:

1. If you are using Omnichannel admin center, on the site map, select **Record routing** under **General settings**. If you are using Customer Service Hub, on the site map, select **Record routing** under **Unified routing**.
2. On the **Record routing** page, select **Add**.
3. In the **Add a record type** dialog box, select an entity from the **Record type** list, and select **Add**. The entity is added and listed on the **Record routing** page.
4. Select the entity for which you want to configure routing.
5. On the page that appears, configure the intake rules in the Intake rules section. More information: [Configure intake rules](#configure-intake-rules)
6. If you want to route the record using a workstream, configure the workstream in the **Workstreams** section.

### Configure intake rules

Perform the following steps to configure the intake rules that can be evaluated based on the hierarchy of the rules that you set up.


### Create workstreams for record routing



## Create entity record workstream in Omnichannel Administration

This section describes how to create a workstream for an entity that has been enabled for routing.

1. Sign in to the Omnichannel Administration app.

2. Select **Work Streams** under **Channels** in the sitemap.

3. Select **New** in the **Active Work Streams** page.

4. Specify the following in the **New Work Stream** page.

    | Tab | Field | Value | Description | 
    |---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
    | Work Distribution | Name | Case Work stream | Provide a name to the work stream. <br> **Note:** The value provided is an example.  |
    | Work Distribution | Channel | Entity Records | Select the **Entity Records** channel from the list.|
    | Work Distribution | Entity | Case | Select an entity from the drop-down menu. <br> If you want to create a entity, select **+ New**. To learn more, see [Enable entity for routing](entity-channel.md#step-3-enable-entity-for-routing). |
    | Work Distribution | Capacity | 50 |Specify the units of capacity that are required to process a conversation for the work stream in the text box. <br> **Note:** <ul><li> The value provided is an example. </li></ul> |
    | Work Distribution | Work distribution mode | Push | Select **Push** when you want to automatically route the cases to the agents. <br><br> Select **Pick** when you want the agents to explicitly pick a conversation from the **Open work items** in agent dashboard. |
    | Work Distribution | Allowed presences | Allowed, Busy | Set the allowed presence status <br><br> Select the option and type a presence status in the search box. Select a status from the list. <br> **Note:** <ul><li> The value provided is an example. </li></ul>|

5. Select **Save** to save the work stream.

> [!Note]
> When you enable an entity for routing, the Omnichannel Administration app creates a default work stream for each entity. If you create a new work stream or update the default work stream according to your business scenario, you need to update the work stream information in **Entity Records distribution Flow**. To learn more, see [Update entity records work distribution flow](multiple-ws-entity-record-routing.md#update-entity-records-work-distribution-flow).

## Upgrade path for preview users

If you are upgrading from preview release to the latest version, then earlier configured work streams will be obsolete. You need to create a new entity records channel and then redefine the work streams. To learn more, see [Entity records routing](entity-channel.md).

You can view the Bot dashboard in the Omnichannel for Customer Service app. On the **Home** tab, select the plus (**+**) icon, and then select **Analytics and insights**. On the page that appears, select the **Bot** tab.

## Report details

The reports summarize the key performance indicators for the specified time period and the percent change over the period. You can filter these areas by duration, channel, queue, and agent.

## Bot Hourly detail drill down view

The Bot hourly details drill down view provides more granular insight into the hour-by-hour breakdown of key conversation metrics within the contact center. The metrics are the same as the day-by-day view ensuring that supervisors can consistently analyze their contact center operation regardless of desired duration granularity. 
To view the drill down, select any single metric value on the desired day, then select **Hourly details**.

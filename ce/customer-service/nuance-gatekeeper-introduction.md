As we move forward into an AI world with increased speed, experiences have become more seamless with manual labor becoming unnecessary for everyone. This is true about the experiences tied to call centers and customer care too.

Nuance Gatekeeper is a biometric authentication and fraud prevention technology that can be integrated with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service. It offers a streamlined verification process that allows contact centers to identify customers through natural conversation without relying on specific questions, security codes, or secret questions and answers.

By using voice biometrics, Nuance Gatekeeper can quickly and accurately verify a customer's identity, significantly reducing the risk of fraud and protecting customers' personal data from unauthorized access. The integration with Nuance Gatekeeper in Customer Service helps agents deliver efficient, personalized service and helps fraud teams prevent, detect, and investigate more fraud.

## How Nuance Gatekeeper works in Customer Service

After Nuance Gatekeeper is integrated with the voice channel, it analyzes how a person sounds, how they talk, while characterizing their device, network, location, and other factors for signs of fraud. All of this happens seamlessly in the background of each engagement, so your customers can get the service they need without remembering pass codes, PINs, or security questions.

Nuance Gatekeeper uses deep neural networks to determine a single, transparent authentication decision for every engagement. The platform is built on the following pillars of biometric security and AI decision-making: 

- **Voice**: Authenticate customers based on the distinct characteristics of their voice, regardless of age or language. 
- **Channel**: Identify device, ANI, channel, location, and network to flag suspicious signals such as hidden network origins, SIM swapping, and spoofing. 
- **AI risk engine**: Deep neural networks analyze interactions to determine true matches and prevent fraud.

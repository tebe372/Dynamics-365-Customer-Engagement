The **Summary** report is displayed in the default view in the Customer Service workspace. The report includes a variety of charts with graphical views of your organization's key performance indicators (KPIs).

By default, the report shows you KPIs for the past one day and for all channels, queues, and agents in your system. You can use the data filtering options to select data for specific time periods, channels, queues, agents, conversation status, direction, and time zone. Additionally, you can also pause the updates by using the **Pause updates** button.

# View and understand the Summary report in Omnichannel real-time analytics

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The **Summary** report is the default report that appears when you select the Omnichannel real-time analytics dashboard in Customer Service workspace. This report provides KPIs across the volume of customer interactions and service levels, along with the available agent capacity in real time. You can filter these areas by time, channels, queue, time zone, or conversation status.

For details on metrics displayed in the Summary report, go to Omnichannel analytics metrics.

## Interactive charts

You can view different types of charts on the report, such as bar, horizontal bar, and donut chart. The visual display helps you see the changes and patterns in the data, and act quickly to address the most important issues.

When you select a component on the chart, the data gets filtered accordingly and you'll be able to view data related only to the selected component. For example, if you select the **Busy** piece in the **Agent availability status** chart, the dashboard will refresh and you’ll see only the agents who are currently in the **Busy** state.

For details on metrics displayed in the Summary report charts, go to Omnichannel analytics metrics.

## Drill-down reports

### Conversations over time drill-down

You can view additional details about conversations, when you select the **Show more** link on the **Conversations over time** KPI. You can drill through conversations over time and analyze data by selecting the **Channel** or **Queue** tabs.

### Agent availability status drill-down

You can view additional details about agent availability, when you select the **Show more** link on the **Agent availability status** KPI. You can drill through agent analytics by selecting the **Availability status** or **Capacity unit** tabs, which will help you effectively manage agent activity in real time.

# View and understand the Summary report in Omnichannel real-time analytics

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The **Summary** report is the default report that appears when you select the Omnichannel real-time analytics dashboard in Customer Service workspace. You can filter these areas by time, channels, queue, time zone, or conversation status. More information: [Overview of Omnichannel real-time analytics dashboards (preview)](intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md#overview-of-omnichannel-real-time-analytics-dashboards-preview)

This report provides the summary of customer conversations over time, and by channel or queue. Statistics about the channel through which a conversation comes in helps you analyze and manage queue distribution accordingly. For example, higher abandoned conversations can often lead to decreased customer satisfaction. You can take care of high abandoned conversations by looking into operational metrics such as agent availability and queue distribution in real time.

Additionally, you can also track customer sentiment to analyze whether customers are getting adequate support. For example, a high average handle time might indicate that agents are taking more than the required time to resolve customer issues. Depending on the issue, you could then provide the required training or support to help agents resolve customer issues faster.

In addition to the metrics that you already see on the Summary dashboard, you can also add more metrics by editing the visual display of your report. More information: [Customize visual display](customize-reports.md#customize-visual-display)

For details on metrics displayed in the Summary report, go to Omnichannel analytics metrics.

## Interactive charts

You can view different types of charts on the report, such as bar, horizontal bar, and donut chart. The visual display helps you see the changes and patterns in the data, and act quickly to address the most important issues.

When you select a component on the chart, the data gets filtered accordingly and you'll be able to view data related only to the selected component. For example, if you select the **Busy** piece in the **Agent availability status** chart, the dashboard will refresh and you’ll see only the agents who are currently in the **Busy** state.

For details on metrics displayed in the Summary report charts, go to Omnichannel analytics metrics.

### Conversations over time drill-down

### Agent availability status drill-down

You can view additional details about agent availability, when you select the **Show more** link on the **Agent availability status** KPI. You can drill through agent analytics by selecting the **Availability status** or **Capacity unit** tabs, which will help you effectively manage agent activity in real time.

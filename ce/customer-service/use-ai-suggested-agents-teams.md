## Introduction

You can chat with experts who have worked on cases similar to yours to quickly resolve customer issues. To chat with experts, your administrator must enable the option to collaborate with other agents in Microsoft Teams.

## Collaborate with AI-suggested agents in Microsoft Teams

In Customer Service workspace, when you open a case, **Teams chat (Preview)** appears in the app side pane on the right. The conversations pertaining to the most recent cases that are similar to the case you're viewing are loaded.

If no similar cases exist, a message is displayed that no suggested contacts can be found.

You can do the following:

1. Select **New linked chat**. The following options appear:
   - A box to type agent names to create linked chats.
   - Suggested contacts who worked on similar cases.
   - The option to send an introductory message that summarizes the case and includes details, such as the following:
     - Status
     - Case title
     - Case number
     - Customer
     - Description
     - Priority

2. Type an agent name or select from the suggested contacts. You can select more than one agent and then select **Start chat**.

3. Optionally, you can edit the group name.

4. In the **Other chats** list, you can select **More commands** for a contact, and then select **Link to this Case**. The linked chat is pinned to the pane at the top.

5. Use the filter option to list the chats pertaining to a particular conversation.

The agent who receives the chat message gets a link to the case record for which you started the chat. The agent can select the link and open the case to view the details.

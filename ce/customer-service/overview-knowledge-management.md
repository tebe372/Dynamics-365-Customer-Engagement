# Overview of knowledge management

Knowledge management plays a vital role in enabling organizations to deliver world-class customer care by providing organizations the ability to author, categorize, deliver, analyse, and share information through a knowledge base.

Knowledge management comes across as a powerful tool that empowers primary service providers, such as agents to deal with customer issues right away, thereby building customer credibility. Agents get access to rich, high-quality knowledge resources across consistent and contextual Omnichannel experiences with intelligent discoverability that drives customer satisfaction and productivity.

Depending on the role that you play in an organization, here’s a glimpse into how you can leverage knowledge management and help your business grow.

### Create and design knowledge articles:
  - Role: Knowledge author
    - Create rich and well-formatted content for emails or knowledge articles using the new rich text editor. More information: [Use the rich text editor to create knowledge articles and emails](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#use-the-rich-text-editor-to-create-knowledge-articles-and-emails).
    - Review knowledge articles for accuracy before they’re published or made available to others. More information: [Review and reject or approve a knowledge article](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#review-and-reject-or-approve-a-knowledge-article).
    - Use templates to create knowledge articles quickly with prepopulated fields in the selected template. Templates also help knowledge managers and authors maintain consistency in branding, language, and structure. More information: [Create a knowledge article template](create-templates-knowledge-article.md#create-a-knowledge-article-template).
    - Set up a default knowledge article authoring language. More information: [Set a default knowledge article authoring language for your organization](set-knowledge-article-authoring-language.md#set-a-default-knowledge-article-authoring-language-for-your-organization).
### Manage the lifecycle of knowledge articles:
  - Role: Knowledge Author
    - Create major and minor versions of a knowledge article, and keep your articles up to date with the latest information while keeping track of changes throughout the lifecycle of your products and services. More information: [Create and manage article versions](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#create-and-manage-article-versions).
    - Create a translation for a knowledge article record in multiple languages.More information: [Create a knowledge article translation](work-knowledge-articles.md#create-a-knowledge-article-translation).
    - Publish articles as soon as they're approved or schedule them for later publication. You can also set expiration dates on articles. More information: [Schedule or publish an article](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#schedule-or-publish-an-article).
### Search multiple knowledge providers:
  - Role: Administrator
    - Use search providers to federate the search of files, documents, or articles from data sources outside of your organization. More information: [Set up a search provider in Customer Service Hub](set-up-search-providers.md#set-up-a-search-provider-in-customer-service-hub).
### Set up search logic and search filters:

### Integrate knowledge management with a Power Virtual Agents bot:

# Overview of knowledge management

Knowledge management plays a vital role in enabling organizations to deliver world-class customer care by providing organizations the ability to author, categorize, deliver, analyze, and share information through a knowledge base.

## Benefits of knowledge management

* Knowledge management with its knowledge article base empowers primary service providers, such as agents resolve customer queries right away, thereby increasing agent productivity.
* Agents get access to rich, high-quality knowledge resources across consistent and contextual Omnichannel experiences which enables quick resolution of issues, thus reducing the average call handling time for agents.
* Knowledge management search capabilities across channels help reduce support tickets through self-service, and drives customer satisfaction.

# Features of knowledge management

Depending on the role that you play in your organization, here’s how you can leverage the features of knowledge management and help your business grow.

## Create knowledge articles

### Create and design knowledge articles
As a knowledge author, you can do the following:
   - Create rich and well-formatted content for emails or knowledge articles using the new rich text editor. More information: [Use the rich text editor to create knowledge articles and emails](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#use-the-rich-text-editor-to-create-knowledge-articles-and-emails).
   - Review knowledge articles for accuracy before they’re published or made available to others. More information: [Review and reject or approve a knowledge article](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#review-and-reject-or-approve-a-knowledge-article).
   - Use templates to create knowledge articles quickly with prepopulated fields in the selected template. Templates also help knowledge managers and authors maintain consistency in branding, language, and structure. More information: [Create a knowledge article template](create-templates-knowledge-article.md#create-a-knowledge-article-template).
   - Set up a default knowledge article authoring language. More information: [Set a default knowledge article authoring language for your organization](set-knowledge-article-authoring-language.md#set-a-default-knowledge-article-authoring-language-for-your-organization).
### Manage the lifecycle of knowledge articles
As a knowledge author, you can do the following:
  - Create major and minor versions of a knowledge article, and keep your articles up to date with the latest information while keeping track of changes throughout the lifecycle of your products and services. More information: [Create and manage article versions](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#create-and-manage-article-versions).
  - Create a translation for a knowledge article record in multiple languages.More information: [Create a knowledge article translation](work-knowledge-articles.md#create-a-knowledge-article-translation).
  - Publish articles as soon as they're approved or schedule them for later publication. You can also set expiration dates on articles. More information: [Schedule or publish an article](customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article.md#schedule-or-publish-an-article).
### Search multiple knowledge providers
As an administrator, you can do the following:

Use search providers to federate the search of files, documents, or articles from data sources outside of your organization. More information: [Set up a search provider in Customer Service Hub](set-up-search-providers.md#set-up-a-search-provider-in-customer-service-hub).

## Search knowledge

### Set up search logic and search filters
As an administrator, you can do the following:
  - Set up a knowledge search logic for your knowledge articles to help agents find only the articles they need. More information: [Set up knowledge search logic](set-up-knowledge-management-embedded-knowledge-search.md#set-up-knowledge-search-logic).
  - Create filters to help your agents more quickly find what they’re looking for. More information: [Enable search filters for knowledge articles](enable-knowledge-article-search-filters.md#enable-search-filters-for-knowledge-articles).

## Self-service 

### Integrate knowledge management with a Power Virtual Agents bot 
As an administrator you can do the following:
  
  - Integrate Power Virtual Agents bot with knowledge management to make it easier to use customized conversations in your bot. This frees up your agent’s time to deal with complex issues that need human intervention, as the bot helps answer questions, perform actions, and solve issues that are simple in nature. More information: [Integrate knowledge management with a Power Virtual Agents bot](integrate-KM-with-PVA.md#integrate-knowledge-management-with-a-power-virtual-agents-bot).

More information:[Configure Knowledge search insights for Dynamics 365 Customer Service](enable-knowledge-search-insights.md#configure-knowledge-search-insights-for-dynamics-365-customer-service).

# Overview of knowledge management

Knowledge management plays a vital role in enabling organizations to deliver world-class customer care. Allowing the agents to create rich, high-quality knowledge resources and showing the right knowledge content across engagement modalities (including self service, assisted service, and onsite service), expedites issue resolution and drives customer and agent satisfaction and productivity. 

The Dynamics 365 Customer Service knowledge management solution lets you:

- **Create and design knowledge articles:** Create rich and well-formatted content for emails and knowledge articles by using rich text editor.
- **Manage the article lifecycle:** Use out-of-box business process flows to manage article lifecycles, or create new processes.
- **Manage the article version history:** Manage updates to articles without disrupting the live or published articles.
- **Translate articles:** Provide translations of an article in multiple languages.
- **Publish articles:** Publish articles as soon as they're approved, or schedule them for later publication. You can also set expiration dates on articles.
- **Track and analyze article statics:** Track how many time an article is used, viewed, and sent to customers.
- **Search multiple knowledge providers:** Use search providers to federate the search of files, documents, or articles from data sources outside of your organization.
- **Set up search filters:** Create filters to help your agents more quickly find what theyâ€™re looking for.

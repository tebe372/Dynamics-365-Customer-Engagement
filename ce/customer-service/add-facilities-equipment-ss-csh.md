# Add facilities and equipment to schedule service

## Introduction

Facilities and equipment are resources you use to perform services for your customers. Facilities could be physical spaces like service bays or conference rooms and equipment could be tools or other assets. Add these resources to Dynamics 365 Customer Service to ensure optimal services for your customers.  

## Create a new facility or equipment record

Make sure that you have the required security role or equivalent permissions.

You can create a new facility or equipment record in the Customer Service admin center (preview) or Omnichannel admin center app.

1. Go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.

    2. In the **Facilities & equipment** section, select **Manage**.
        
        The **Local Facilities/Equipment** view is displayed. You can switch between various system views using the drop-down list.  

   ### [Customer Service Hub](#tab/customerservicehub)

    1. In the site map, go to **Scheduling**.
    2. From the list of entity records, select **Facilities/Equipment** in **Scheduling**.

By default, this is set to the time zone you’ve selected in the **General** tab of the **Set Personal Options** dialog box.

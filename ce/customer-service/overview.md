# Overview of Dynamics 365 Customer Service

*<a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/customer-service/overview/" target="_blank">Try Dynamics 365 Customer Service for free</a>*

Welcome to Dynamics 365 Customer Service! We are delighted to offer you a suite of capabilities to ensure your business can deliver the best customer service experience possible to your customers. We believe that knowing your customers enables you to personalize each experience and optimizes your agents' productivity so you can earn customers for life. 

The agent experience is the heart of Dynamics 365 Customer Service. The key to improving satisfaction in service delivery is enabling agents to take customer requests from any channel, handle multiple sessions at a time, interact with multiple apps without losing context, and enhance their workflow with productivity tools.  

We offer several app experiences for you to choose from, depending on your support organization’s needs.

Use [!INCLUDE[pn-ms-dyn-365-for-customer-service](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-365-for-customer-service.md)] to:

- Track customer issues through cases
- Record all interactions related to a case
- Share information in the knowledge base
- Use unified routing to efficiently route work items
- Manage conversations across channels, including voice
- Use AI-driven embedded insights and analytics to improve customer satisfaction
- Collaborate with experts in Microsoft Teams
- Create and track service levels through service-level agreements (SLAs)
- Define service terms through entitlements
- Manage performance and productivity through reports and dashboards
- Create and schedule services
- Participate in chats


## Administer Customer Service

You can configure and manage the different capabilities in Customer Service by using any of the following apps based on the licensing module that you've purchased. While you can use any of the admin apps to set up the features in Customer Service, we recommend that you use the latest apps and centrally manage the features in a robust framework.

- **Customer Service admin center (preview)**: Helps in managing the different features of Customer Service in one place. You can configure all the features of the customer support, operations, and agent experiences through the new app. You can manage core customer service and other features, such as service terms, service scheduling, and all the channels in Omnichannel for Customer Service. More information: [Customer Service admin center (preview) at a glance](cs-admin-center.md)

- **Omnichannel admin center**: Helps in managing all your chat and digital messaging channels, including the voice channel. You can configure enterprise-grade routing and assignment capability by using the unified routing infrastructure to route service requests on all channels. More information: [Omnichannel admin center at a glance](oc-admin-center.md)

- **Customer Service Hub**: Helps in managing knowledge articles and routing of cases and is available for use on desktop browsers and mobile devices. Use the **Service Management** site map to set up features, such as case management, queues, routing rules, service terms, insights, and service scheduling. More information: [Get started with Customer Service Hub](customer-service-hub-user-guide-basics.md)

- **App profile manager**: Helps in creating and managing targeted app experiences for agents and supervisors as an alternative to building and maintaining custom apps. You can create custom profiles with specific session templates, conversation channels, and productivity tools. You can then assign these profiles to agents and supervisors who use the Customer Service workspace and Omnichannel for Customer Service apps. More information: [Introduction to the app profile manager](../app-profile-manager/overview.md)

  > [!NOTE]
  > The capabilities offered by the app profile manager are also available in the new Customer Service admin center (preview) app. We recommend that you use the new app.

- **Omnichannel Administration**: Helps in setting up and managing the chat and digital messaging channels and other features in Omnichannel for Customer Service. More information: [Omnichannel Administration](omnichannel-administrator.md)
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > The Omnichannel Administration app won't be supported after April 30, 2022, and will be deprecated in a future release. We recommend that you use the Omnichannel admin center app. The latest features, such as unified routing and voice channel, can be configured and used only in this admin app. For more information about the deprecation announcement, see [Omnichannel Administration app is deprecated](../customer-service/deprecations-customer-service.md#omnichannel-administration-app-is-deprecated).

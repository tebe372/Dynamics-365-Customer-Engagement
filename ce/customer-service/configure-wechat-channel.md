# Configure a WeChat channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## WeChat channel

Using social messaging channels such as WeChat, which has a large user base in Asia, lets organizations enhance business efficiencies in certain geographical areas by integrating these services into Omnichannel for Customer Service.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The WeChat channel isn't available in the Government Community Cloud (GCC) region.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

- WeChat is provisioned in your environment. More information: [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](omnichannel-provision-license.md)
 
  > [!NOTE]
  > To enable the WeChat channel in an existing environment, you must upgrade to the latest version of Omnichannel for Customer Service. For information, [Upgrade Omnichannel for Customer Service](upgrade-omnichannel.md).

- An active subscription to the WeChat service account or sandbox account (if using sandbox for testing) exists and is stored as a contact on your phone. You'll initiate WeChat conversations by contacting the subscription account. More information: [WeChat documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2124569)

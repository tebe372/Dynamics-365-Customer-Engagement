# Use sites to manage your service locations

## Introduction

Create sites to define the locations where you provide service to your customers. When youâ€™re scheduling resources, you can define which resources will work on which site.

You can also create a site in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) 9.1 also. More information: [New features in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](../customerengagement/on-premises/whats-new.md#support-for-site-entity-in-unified-interface)

## Create a site

Before you begin, make sure you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions.

2. Navigate to either on the Customer Service Hub or on Customer Service admin center (preview) app. Depending on your app, perform the following steps:

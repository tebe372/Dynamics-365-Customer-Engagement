# Availability of Customer Service Hub

[!include[cc-early-access-2020w1](../includes/cc-early-access-2020w1.md)]

In 2020 release wave 1, the Customer Service Hub solution that is built on the Unified Interface framework will be automatically installed in all the environments that have any model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 installed.

The salient features of the integrated solution are as follows:

- Existing customers can access **Customer Service Hub** in their environment. To learn more: [Introduction to Customer Service Hub](user-guide-customer-service-hub.md).
- Users with the **Customer service app access** security role will be able to view and use the app. To learn about granting or revoking the role, see [Assign a security role to a user](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).
- If you delete the app manually, it will be installed automatically during the next update cycle.

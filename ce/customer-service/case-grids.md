The modernized Case grid helps you increase agent productivity by providing quick access to information, such as last customer interaction, case age, and the next SLA breach. The modern UI presents data in an intuitive manner that helps supervisors and agents perform inline edits and quick operations with minimal clicks, thereby facilitating decision-making.

## Key features

The following are some of the key features:

- New view called **Enhanced Active Cases** with a set of pre-defined columns.
- View icons for **Priority** and the **Origin** channel.
-	View avatars for the assigned **Owner**.
- View key data, such as **Case Age**, **Next SLA Breach**, and **Last Interaction** with attachments.
- Perform inline edits and update data for columns. For example, you can double-click on the **Status Reason** column to change the status of the case or set the toggle to **Yes** or **No** in the **Is Escalated** column. The data update is auto saved.
- Use quick navigation to respond to the latest interaction.

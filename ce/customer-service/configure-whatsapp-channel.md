# Configure a WhatsApp channel through Twilio

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Overview of WhatsApp channel through Twilio

Many customers use social messaging channels like WhatsApp for their personal communication needs and prefer to use the WhatsApp channel to engage with businesses also.

The success of social media customer service, like all other customer service, depends on the quality of care provided. Communications from agents should be timely, accurate, sensitive, brief, and friendly, which ultimately improves the customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.

The WhatsApp channel feature lets you integrate WhatsApp through Twilio with Omnichannel for Customer Service to engage with customers who prefer the WhatsApp channel.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure channels are provisioned in your environment. For information, see [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](omnichannel-provision-license.md).
  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > To enable the Twilio channel in an existing Omnichannel environment, you must upgrade to the latest version of Omnichannel for Customer Service. For information, [Upgrade Omnichannel for Customer Service](upgrade-omnichannel.md).

- Obtain a Twilio account with an appropriate subscription or a Twilio sandbox account. For information on configuring a Twilio sandbox account, see [Integrate a Twilio sandbox account with Omnichannel for Customer Service](#integrate-a-twilio-sandbox-account-with-omnichannel-for-customer-service)

- Connect Twilio Number to your WhatsApp Business Profile. To learn more, see [Connect your Twilio Number to your WhatsApp Business Profile](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/whatsapp/tutorial/connect-number-business-profile).

## WhatsApp message types and 24 hours session rule

- **Template messages:** These are the outbound messages that agents send through Twilio using one of the pre-approved templates. They are typically transactional messages, such as delivery alerts and appointment reminders, sent to users who have opted in to receive messages from your organization. For messages requiring localization, you must get the message approved by WhatsApp in each language. For more information about WhatsApp message templates, see [WhatsApp documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/).

- **Session messages:** According to WhatsApp, session messages are incoming messages from a customer or outgoing replies by an agent to the incoming messages, within 24 hours. A messaging session starts when agents receive a message from a customer. It lasts for 24 hours from the most recently received message. Session messages do not need to follow a template, and can include media attachments.

- **24 hours session rule:** A messaging session starts when an agent receives a message from a customer or replies to the incoming message from the customer. When the customer sends a message, the agent has 24 hours to reply from the time the agent received it. However, after 24 hours, the agent can send a message to customer only by using a predefined and approved template.

### Integrate a Twilio sandbox account with Omnichannel for Customer Service

1. In Twilio, go to the **Programmable SMS** > **Programmable Messaging** > **WhatsApp sandbox**.
2. In the **WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN** box, enter the Twilio inbound URL that you generated in Omnichannel for Customer Service, and save the changes.
3. To test the WhatsApp channel with the Twilio sandbox, you can send a WhatsApp message to the number provided by Twilio with a unique code that is also provided by Twilio. You can also use the sandbox message template provided by Twilio to test sending messages outside of the 24-hour window.

## Create routing rules

1.	Go to **Work Distribution Management** > **Work Streams**.
2.	Open the out-of-the-box work stream or the one you created.
3.	On the **Routing rules items** tab, you can create a routing rule to transfer the message to an appropriate agent. Select the entity as **WhatsApp Engagement Context**. For example, you can create a rule to transfer WhatsApp chat from a customer to the default queue.

When you create conditions for routing rules, the **WhatsApp Engagement Context (Conversation)** entity enables you to set the **Customer Phone Number** and **Customer First Message** attributes. The **Customer First Message** attribute lets you create a pre-filled message that will automatically appear in the text field of a customer chat, which can be used for routing.

## Modify settings for a specific WhatsApp phone number 

1. In the Omnichannel Administration app, go to your WhatsApp application and select the WhatsApp phone number you want to modify. 

2. On the **General settings** tab, provide the following information:
    
    - **Language**: Select the preferred language for your WhatsApp phone number.
    
    - **Work stream**: Select an existing work stream or create a new one.

    - **Enable file attachments for customers**: Set to **Yes** to allow customers to send file attachments to agents. Otherwise, set **No**. 

    - **Enable file attachments for agents**: Set to **Yes** to allow agents to send file attachments to customers. When the agent sends an attachment, the app sends the blob storage URL to the channel. Otherwise, set **No**. 
    
       To learn more about attachments, see [File attachments](enable-file-attachments.md).

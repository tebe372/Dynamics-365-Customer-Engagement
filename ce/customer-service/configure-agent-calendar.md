As an administrator, you can help agents in your organization plan their work hours by viewing their work schedules at a glance. The **My Schedule** view in the Dynamics 365 Customer Service workspace app lets agents quickly view their working hours, non-working hours, breaks, and any scheduled time off. The calendar view is a read-only visual that provides daily, weekly, and monthly views. It also has an agenda view that provides a list-type view of the agent's schedule.

# Configure the agent calendar view (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note.md)]

As an administrator or a supervisor, you can help agents in your organization view their work schedules. The **My Schedule** view in the Dynamics 365 Customer Service workspace app lets agents quickly view their working hours, nonworking hours, breaks, and any scheduled time off. The calendar view is a read-only visual that provides daily, weekly and monthly views of an agent's schedule. It also has an agenda view that provides a list-type view of the agent's schedule.

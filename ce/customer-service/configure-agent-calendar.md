You can help agents in your organization to plan for their work hours by viewing their work schedules at-a-glance. The calendar view in the Dynamics 365 Customer Service workspace app lets agents quickly view their working hours, their non-working hours, and any scheduled time off. The calendar view is a read-only visual that provides daily, weekly, and monthly views.

You can configure real-time analytics in Omnichannel for Customer Service and give your supervisors access to real-time metrics and KPIs that reflect the situation in the contact center as they oversee agents handling customer conversations coming through multiple channels.

The following real-time analytics reports are available:

- Summary
- Voice
- Agents
- Ongoing conversations

Make sure that you have the required administrator permissions for Dynamics 365. You can configure Omnichannel real-time analytics reports in the Customer Service admin center app.

1. In the site map, select **Insights** in **Operations**. The **Insights** page appears.
1. On the **Insights** page, **Report Settings** section, go to  **Real-time Analytics (preview)** and select **Manage**.
1. On the **Real-time analytics (preview)** page, set the **Enable Omnichannel real-time analytics** toggle to **On**.
1. In the **Additional options** section, select the **Add real-time analytics for Omnichannel voice** option.
You will see the above option, only if your organization has the Voice feature configured.

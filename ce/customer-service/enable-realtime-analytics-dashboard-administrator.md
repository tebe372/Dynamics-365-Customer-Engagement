You can enable real-time analytics in Omnichannel for Customer Service and give your supervisors access to real-time metrics and KPIs that reflect the situation in the contact center as agents handle customer conversations coming through multiple channels.

The following real-time analytics reports are available:

- Summary
- Voice
- Agents
- Ongoing conversations

You can enable Omnichannel real-time analytics reports in the Customer Service admin center app.

Make sure that you have the required administrator permissions for Dynamics 365.

1. In the site map, select **Insights** in **Operations**. The **Insights** page appears.
1. On the **Insights** page, **Report Settings** section, go to  **Real time analytics (preview)** and select **Manage**.
1. On the **Real time analytics (preview)** page, set the **Enable Omnichannel real-time analytics** toggle to **On**.
1. In the **Additional options** section, select the **Add real-time analytics for voice** option.
You will see the above option, only if your organization has the Voice feature enabled.

## Provide report access to additional security roles
Perform the following steps to enable users with different privileges to access reports beyond the default ones.

1. In Dynamics 365, navigate to **Settings** and select **Advanced settings**.

1. Select **Security** and then **Security roles**.

1. Select the security role that you want to enable access for. For example, agent manager.

1. Select the **Custom Entities** tab.

1. Grant Read privileges to the following entities:

   - **Omnichannel for Customer Service real-time analytics**
   - **Insights**
1. Select **Save and close**. The agent manager can now see the Omnichannel for Customer Service real-time analytics report.

You can see the reports by navigating to the **Service** > **Analytics and Insights** > **Omnichannel for Customer Service real-time  analytics** page. By default, the **Summary** page is displayed.

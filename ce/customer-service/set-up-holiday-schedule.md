# Create and manage holiday schedules

Avoid having your service level agreements (SLAs) affected when your service organization is closed by creating a holiday schedule and adding it to your service calendar.  
  
For example, if your service organization has an SLA to reply to email cases within two business days, you can create a holiday schedule and add it to your service calendar. Then, if a customer submits an email case on that holiday, your SLA is clear and is not affected by the holiday closure.  

> [!NOTE]
> With the latest release of Dynamics 365 Customer Service app, holiday schedule in service management is available in the Customer Service Hub. We recommend that you create and manage holiday schedules using the new experience.
 
## Create a holiday schedule 

You can create a holiday schedule in the Customer Service admin center or Customer Service Hub app
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_custsvcmgr_sysadmin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-custsvcmgr-sysadmin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)] [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  

2. Go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.

    ### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)

      1. In the site map, select **Calendar** in **Operations**. The **Calendar** page appears.
      1. In the **Holiday calendar** section, select **Manage**.                                                                         
        
         The **All Holiday Schedules** view is displayed. You can switch between various system views using the dropdown list.  

    ### [Customer Service Hub](#tab/customerservicehub)

     1. In the site map, go to **Service Management**.
     1. From the list of entity records, select **Holiday Schedule** in **Service Terms**.                                                              
       
        The **All Holiday Schedules** view is displayed. You can switch between various system views using the dropdown list.  
  
3. Select **New** and in the **Create Holiday Schedule** dialog box, enter a name and description for the holiday, and then select **Create**.  
  
4. When the holiday opens, select **New** in the **Holidays** grid to add the holiday to your customer service calendar.  
  
5. In the **Add Holiday** dialog box, specify the **Name**, **Start Date**, **End Date**, and **Duration** of the holiday, and then select **OK**.  
  
   The holiday is created and associated with your customer service calendar. After the customer service schedule is associated with an SLA, then your SLA during business hours is not affected.

# Create and manage holiday schedules

Avoid having your service level agreements (SLAs) affected when your service organization is closed by creating a holiday schedule and adding it to your service calendar.  
  
For example, if your service organization has an SLA to reply to email cases within two business days, you can create a holiday schedule and add it to your service calendar. Then, if a customer submits an email case on that holiday, your SLA is clear and is not affected by the holiday closure.  

> [!NOTE]
> With the latest release of Dynamics 365 Customer Service app, holiday schedule in service management is available in the Customer Service Hub. We recommend that you create and manage holiday schedules using the new experience.
 
## Create a holiday schedule  (Customer Service Hub)
Follow these steps to create a new holiday schedule:
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_custsvcmgr_sysadmin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-custsvcmgr-sysadmin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)] [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. In the Customer Service Hub sitemap, go to **Service Management** and select **Service Terms** > **Holiday Schedule**.
  
4. Select **New** and in the **Create Holiday Schedule** dialog box, enter a name and description for the holiday, and then select **Create**.  
  
6. When the holiday opens, select **New** in the **Holidays** grid to add the holiday to your customer service calendar.  
  
7. In the **Add a Holiday** dialog box, specify the **Name**, **Start Date**, **End Date**, and **Duration** of the holiday, and then select **OK**.  
  
   The holiday is created and associated with your customer service calendar. After the customer service schedule is associated with an SLA,  then your SLA during business hours is not affected.

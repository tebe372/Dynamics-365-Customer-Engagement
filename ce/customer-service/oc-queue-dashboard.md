# Queue dashboard

The Queue dashboard gives you a broad overview of the customer service experience in your organization by providing insights into how specific queues are operating.

To view the Queue dashboard, go to Omnichannel historical analytics and select **Queue** in the workspace.

By default, the dashboard shows you KPIs for the past month and for all channels, queues, and agents in your system. The data filtering options allow you to select data for specific time periods, channels, queues, agents, conversation status, and timezone. To filter data by duration, channel, queue, agent, conversation status, or timezone, select a value from the respective drop-down list.

> [!NOTE]
If you switch to a different dashboard, the filter you specify persists and is applied to the data on all dashboards.

## Queue Hourly details drill down view

The Queue hourly details drill down view provides more granular insight into the hour-by-hour breakdown of key conversation metrics within the contact center. The Conversation summary and Conversation details metrics are the same as the day-by-day view ensuring that supervisors can consistently analyze their contact center operation regardless of desired duration granularity.

# Introduction to Nuance Cloud IVR 

Nuance Cloud IVR bot is a part of the Digital Contact Center Platform, an open, extensible, and collaborative platform for seamless, omnichannel customer engagement.
The IVR bot allows customers to communicate effectively and resolve their issues efficiently, as if they were speaking with a live agent. Customers can resolve issues on their own using the IVR bot that leads to improved satisfaction and reduced costs.

## How the Nuance Cloud IVR bot works in Customer Service

The bot can be integrated with the voice channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service to enable contextual call transfer. This helps customers to interact with the Nuance IVR bot first and then an Omnichannel for Customer Service agent if the call is escalated.


When an agent accepts a call that’s been transferred from the Nuance Cloud IVR bot, the [Customer Summary](oc-customer-summary.md) page displays the complete information about the customer, along with the conversation transcript of the steps taken by the IVR to resolve the customer issue.

The app displays an error message if there’s no data or  partial customer data.

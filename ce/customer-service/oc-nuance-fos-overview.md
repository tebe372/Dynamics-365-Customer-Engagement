# Introduction to Nuance Cloud IVR 

Nuance Cloud IVR bot is a part of the Digital Contact Center Platformâ€”an open, extensible, and collaborative platform for seamless, omnichannel customer engagement.
The IVR bot allows customers to communicate effectively and resolve their issues efficiently, just as if they were speaking with a live agent. Customers can resolve issues on their own using the IVR bot that leads to improved satisfaction and reduced costs.

# View active conversation for an incoming conversation request

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Customer Summary** form is renamed as **Active Conversation** form.

## Scenario 1: Incoming conversation request for an existing customer record 

When you receive an incoming conversation request, you see a notification and accept the request, a session starts and the **Active Conversation** page appears with the details of the customer and case.

## Scenario 2: Incoming conversation request with an associated record

When you get an incoming conversation request, you see a notification and accept the request. However, if there are no records present in Omnichannel for Customer Service based on the incoming conversation request, you can create a record. To learn more see, [Create a record](oc-create-record.md) and [Link a record](oc-search-link-unlink-record.md).

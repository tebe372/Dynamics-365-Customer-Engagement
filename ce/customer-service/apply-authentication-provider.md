# Apply authentication for search providers

Use the following information to apply authentication as your organization requires.

- **None**: No authentication is required.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Open Authorization (OAuth) 2.0 with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) requires a resource ID, a client ID, and a client secret. OAuth 2.0 works only with Cloud mode.

## OAuth 2.0

> [!NOTE]
> The resource ID, client ID, and client secret values depend on how you set up Azure AD–based authentication for your website.

### Scenario 1

The same application serves both as an identity provider for your website and as the client app that is used to access the website. In this case, the client ID and resource ID are the application ID of the app, and the client secret is the secret that you generated in the app.

After the client app is configured, be sure you create a new client secret in the **Certificates & Secrets** section of the app.

Follow these steps:

1. On the **Branding & properties** tab, in the **Home page URL** field, enter the appropriate information.

1. On the **Authentication** tab, select **Add a platform**. The **Configure platforms** dialog box appears.
1. Select **Web**. The **Configure Web** dialog box appears.
1. In the **Redirect URIs** field, enter the appropriate information.
1. Select the **ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows)** checkbox.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the user token that Azure sends is used for authentication in your website, your website must include the route that is specified in the **Redirect URI** field. Otherwise, that route isn't required.

1. Select **Configure**.
1. On the **Overview** tab, copy the value of the **Application (client) ID** field.

    :::image type="content" source="media/client_id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Overview tab, showing the Application (client) ID field.":::

1. On the **Certificates and secrets** tab, either use the client secret that is provided in the **Generated by App Service** field, or follow these steps to create a new one:

    1. Select **New client secret**. The **Add a client secret** dialog box appears.
    1. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the secret.
    1. In the **Expires** field, specify when the secret expires.
    1. Select **Add**.

### Scenario 2

One application serves as an identity provider for your website, and a second application serves as the client app that is used to access the website. In this case, the client ID is the application ID of the second app, and the client secret is the secret that is configured in the second app. However, the resource ID is the ID of the first app.

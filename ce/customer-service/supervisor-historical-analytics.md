# Supervisor view of historical analytics for unified routing

## Introduction

Historical analytics for unified routing helps supervisors, customer service managers, administrators with insights into the effectiveness of the routing configurations. Using these analytics, they can optimize their routing strategy to improve their customer satisfaction and workforce efficiency.

The historical analytics reports must be enabled and provisioned for you to be able to view the metrics.

## View the historical analytics reports for unified routing

For the records routed using unified routing, the CSR Manager can view the historical analytics in Customer Service Hub and Customer Service workspace. Similarly, the Omnichannel supervisor can view the conversations-specific report in Customer Service workspace and Omnichannel for customer service.

In these reports, you can view the performance of the routed items, queues, and agents. By looking at the metrics, you can determine why a particular work item has landed in a queue, why an agent got one service request over the other, why one of their queues is seeing unwarranted load, while other is starved, and check the diagnostics reports for work items to view and understand how the work items have been routed. Routing diagnostics provide information on the classification and assignment rules that were used to classify and assign the work items.

## Route records using the Save & Route or the Apply Routing Rules option

After you set up and enable a record for routing, you can manually start routing a record either by:
- selecting a record on the home page grid and then selecting **Apply Routing Rule** on the toolbar.
- opening a record form and then selecting  **Save & Route** on the form command bar.

> [!Note]
> The **Apply Routing Rule** button doesn't display on the home page grid of Activities.

To manually route records:

1. Sign in to your model-driven app.

2. Select the record you want to route on the home page grid and then select **Apply Routing Rules**. 
   Alternatively, open the record form and select **Save & Route** on the form command bar. 

   The **Route Case** dialog box appears.

3. Select **Route**. The record is routed based on the active routing rule set.

# Route records in Customer Service using unified routing

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

## Overview

After you set up and enable a record for routing, you can manually start the routing for the records using the save and route button on the entity record forms. As an administrator, you can also route these records automatically using Power Automate. The routing options are as follows:

- Manually route records by using **Save & Route** and **Apply Routing Rules**
- Automatically route records by using custom Flow

## Manually route the record

After you enable a record for routing, you see the **Save & Route** option on the form ribbon on the command bar and **Apply Routing rules** on the record view ribbon on the command bar. You can use these commands to route the record.

1. Sign in to your model-driven app.

2. Select a record that your administrator has enabled routing. <br> For example, in this procedure, **Leads** is enabled for routing, and hence, you can see the button in the Leads form command bar.

3. Select **Leads** in the site map, and you can view the **Apply Routing rules**  in the entity view ribbon command bar. Selecting the **Apply Routing rules** button also routes the record.

4. Select a lead record from the **My Open Leads** view.

5. Select **Save & Route** the command bar. The **Route Case** dialog box appears.

6. Select **Route**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
    > ![Manual trigger](media/manual-trigger.png "Manual trigger")

The record will be routed based on the active routing rule set.

## Automatically route using Flow

You can set up a custom flow that is based on conditions, such as when a record is created and updated, to route the records automatically. Let's see how to set up a custom flow for create condition.

To enable automatic trigger to route the records:

1. Sign in to Power Automate.

2. Select the environment for which you want to update the Flow.

3. Select **My Flows** in the site map.

4. Select **New** and select the **Automated-from blank** option. Select **Skip** in the **Build an automated flow** dialog.

5. Type **Common Data Service**, and select it from the list. The Common Data Service connector enables you to connect to the Microsoft Dataverse environment.

6. Type **When a record is created, updated or deleted** in the search box, and select it from the list. **When a record is created, updated or deleted** is the trigger condition step.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select Dataverse and When a record is created, updated or deleted trigger](media/route-trigger1.png "Select Dataverse and When a record is created, updated or deleted trigger")

7. Specify the following in the **When a record is created, updated or deleted** trigger.

    | Field | Description | Example Value |
    |-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
    | Trigger condition| Specify the condition to fire the trigger. That is, when you select a trigger condition, based on this state, the entity record will be routed automatically. <br> <br> The list of possible values are: <ul> <li>Create</li> <li>Create or Delete</li> <li>Create or Update</li> <li>Create or Update or Delete</li> <li>Delete</li> <li>Update</li> <li>Update or Delete</li>| Create |
    | The entity name | Specify the entity collection name for which you want to fire the trigger. |  Leads |
    | Scope | Specify where this trigger must be applied. | Organization |

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
    > ![Specify the trigger condition](media/route-trigger2.png "Specify the trigger condition")

8. Select **New step**. The **Choose an action** step appears.

9. Enter **Perform an unbound action** in the search box, and select the action from the list. The **Perform an unbound action** step appears.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
    > ![Select perform an unbound action](media/route-trigger3.png "Select perform an unbound action")

10. Enter **msdyn_ApplyRoutingRuleEntityRecord** in the **Action Name** field.

11. Enter the entity collection name and unique identifier of the record in the specified format against the **Target** field:

    Format: `<entity collection name>(unique identifier of the entity)`
    Example: leads(Lead)

    > [!Note]
    > 1. Open your browser and go to `https://<org_name>/api/data/v9.0/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='<entityname>')`
    > For example: `https://contoso.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='lead')`.
    > 2. Search for `LogicalCollectionName`, and you can view the entity collection name for a particular entity.
    > For example: `"LogicalCollectionName":"leads"`
    > Here, `leads` is the entity collection name.
    
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
    > ![Select Perform an unbound action example](media/route-trigger4.png "Select Perform an unbound action example")


12. Select **Save**.

Now, based on the flow that is defined, whenever a record, say lead, is created, the flow applies the **ApplyRoutingRuleRecord** action on the record. Similarly, you can create a custom Flow based on your business scenarios.

> [!Note]
> - For case entity record, an out-of-the-box trigger is shipped to route the cases automatically. The routing is based on the **Route Case** field value in the case entity record. 
> - If **Route Case** is set to **Yes**, the record will be routed upon creation.
> - If **Route Case** is set to No, the record will not be routed upon creation.
> - By default, for all the cases created from user interface, the **Route Case** field is set to **No**. Hence, the routing for these is not triggered.
> - You can also build a custom flow to automatically trigger routing for cases using any other field per your business scenario, as explained in this topic.

# Use the inbox

The inbox in Customer Service workspace gives you quick view of your assigned cases and conversations. It's designed to be your central place to locate, manage, and complete your day-to-day work. It can help you efficiently work on high velocity tasks, and promote inbox sessions to regular sessions when you need more time to resolve cases and finish your conversations.

The view you see in your inbox depends on how your administrator has configured it. More information: [Configure the inbox](configure-inbox.md).

The asynchronous channels available in the conversation inbox are as follows:
 - SMS
 - Persistent chat
 - Facebook
 - WeChat
 - LINE
 - WhatsApp
 - Microsoft Teams.

## View the inbox

1. In Customer Service workspace, select **Inbox** on the sitemap.

1. Select either **Cases** or **Conversations** to view a respective list of assigned items.
   
1. Select the item to work on. It opens in a new tab. Alternatively, you can open an item in a new tab by selecting the **new session** icon.

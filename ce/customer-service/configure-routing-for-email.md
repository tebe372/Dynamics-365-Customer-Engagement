# Configure unified routing for email records

In Customer Service, you can configure emails to be routed as a work item and added to queues so that they can be picked up by agents.

***PMs, dev leads, help elaborate the introduction.***

## How you can configure routing of email records

When an email comes from a customer, you can use one of the following methods to handle the mail:

- **Route email as a case**: One of the ways in which you can enable emails to be routed as cases is by configuring the automatically create or update records option. However, this method requires manual intervention in which the user has to use the Save and route option on the case form. Moreover, such work items will not appear on the agent dashboard and agents will not receive notifications about assignment. More information: [Automatically create or update records](automatically-create-update-records.md)

- **Route email as a record**: You need to configure the following settings to route the email as a record.

  1. **Configure a dedicated mailbox and share the mail ID with customers**. Customers can write to the configured mail ID and the mails are converted to cases and routed to the queue that's associated with the mailbox.
  
  1. **Server-side sync**. More information: [Server-side sync](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/admin/server-side-synchronization?view=op-9-1)
  
  1. **Power Automate flow**. Configure the flow in Power Automate to automatically route the work items to agents. The routed records will appear on the agent dashboard as work items. More information: [Route records automatically](routing-trigger-automatic.md)

    1. **Configure workstreams**: Create workstreams, and configure classification and route-to-queue rules. More information: [Create workstreams](create-workstreams.md)
    
    1. **Configure queues**: Create queues, and configure assignment methods. More information: [Create queues for unified routing](queues-omnichannel.md)


The high-level process of how email can be routed using unified routing is depicted in the following architecture diagram.

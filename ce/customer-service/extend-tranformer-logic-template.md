# Extend transformer logic on templates

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Customers can overwrite the out-of-the-box transformer logic by creating a plug-in and registering it as `msdyn_GetKAObjectFromTemplate` message.

Follow the procedure given below to extend the transformer logic for your knowledge article templates.

1. Create a plug-in by following the steps mentioned in [Create a plug-in project](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/tutorial-write-plug-in#BKMK_create).
2. You can write your own mapping logic with the transformed `kaobject` using `context.OutputParameters["Result"]` as Entity. In this example, we will show how you can pre-populate the knowledge article content section with "Hello World". In the plug-in that you created, replace the comment `// Plug-in business logic goes here` with the sample code given below.

```csharp
Entity kaobject = new Entity();
kaobject = context.OutputParameters["Result"] as Entity;
// Changing the content of knowledge article object to "Hello World"
kaobject["content"] = "Hello World";
```
3. Follow the steps mentioned in [Register a plug-in](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/tutorial-write-plug-in#BKMK_register) to register your plug-in.
4. Now, when you create a new knowledge article from the existing template, you will be able to see the content section pre-populated with "Hello World".

# Pricing Scenarios

The voice channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service is built over Azure Communication Services. Prices for Azure Communication Services are based on a pay-as-you-go model. The prices in the following examples are for illustrative purposes and may not reflect the latest Azure pricing.

## Pricing


Calling and screen-sharing services are charged on a per minute per participant basis at $0.004 per participant per minute for group calls. Azure Communication Services doesn't charge for data egress. To understand the various call flows that are possible, see: [Call flow basics](/azure/communication-services/concepts/call-flows)

With the voice channel, Omnichannel for Customer Service provides agents with the ability to receive and make public switched telephone network (PSTN) calls through a native calling experience in Dynamics 365.

Each participant of the call will count in billing for each minute they're connected to the call. This holds true regardless of whether the user is video calling, voice calling, or screen-sharing.

Customers are billed based on the following:

- Teams meeting organizer's license covers the usage generated by Teams users joining Teams meetings and participating in calls via built-in experience in Teams web, desktop, and mobile client. The Teams license does not cover the usage generated in third-party Teams extensions and Teams apps. 

- PSTN call pricing is based on the type of number and location in which a call is terminated (destination), with few scenarios having rates based on origination location.


### Pricing example: Inbound audio call from the customer via Microsoft Teams

Mae is a customer and calls your US toll-free number (acquired from Communication Services) from Microsoft Teams. Customer Service routes the call landing on the Azure Communication Services to the agent, Matias. Matias accepts the incoming call from Mae, and the call lasts for 20 minutes.

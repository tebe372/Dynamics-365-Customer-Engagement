# Pricing scenarios for voice calling

With the voice channel, Customer Service provides agents with the ability to receive and make public switched telephone network (PSTN) calls through a native calling experience.

As you plan to configure and use the voice channel for your business needs you'd want to understand the pricing and billing models, so that you can optimize your costs. The voice channel is built over Azure Communication Services. Azure Communication Services allows you to use phone numbers to make voice calls and send SMS messages with the PSTN.

The prices for Azure Communication Services are based on a pay-as-you-go model. Each participant of the call is considered in the billing for each minute they're connected to the call, irrespective of the call being a video or voice call, or screen-sharing.

Calling and screen-sharing services are charged on a per minute per participant basis at $0.004 per participant per minute for group calls. Azure Communication Services doesn't charge for data egress. To understand the various call flows that are possible, see: [Call flow basics](/azure/communication-services/concepts/call-flows)

For more information about licenses and pricing, see: [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544).

## Pricing scenarios for inbound and outbound calling

The pricing calculations for the following inbound and outbound calling scenarios are listed in this section:

- Inbound: Customer calls from a mobile, call is escalated to a human agent from an IVR bot
- Inbound: Customer calls an agent from Microsoft Teams
- Inbound: Customer calls through Microsoft Teams, Supervisor joins the call to monitor the conversation
- Inbound: Customer calls from a mobile, the Supervisor is invited to consult the conversation
- Inbound: Customer calls from Microsoft Teams, call is transferred to an agent through Teams PSTN
- Outbound: Agent calls the customer
- Inbound: Azure direct routing
- Outbound: Azure direct routing

### Inbound: Customer calls from a mobile, call is escalated to a human agent from an IVR bot

Mae calls your US toll-free number (acquired from Azure Communication Services) from a mobile. The call is routed to a Power Virtual Agents Interactive voice response (IVR) bot. Mae interacts with the bot for two minutes. The bot then escalates the call to a human agent, Matias. The call lasts for eight minutes.

:::image type="content" source="media/Customer-call-escalated-human-agent-IVR.png" alt-text="Inbound call from customer through Teams":::

**Cost calculation**

- One participant on PSTN (inbound from Mae)x 10 minutes x 0.022 per participant per minute = $0.22.
- One participant on Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) (inbound to Power Virtual Agents bot) X 2 x $ 0.004 per minute = $0.008.
  > [!NOTE]
  > The VOIP call to the Power Virtual Agents bot is not covered by the intelligent voice bot minutes included in the Voice Channel for Dynamics 365 Customer Service license.
- One participant on VOIP (inbound to Matias)x 8 x 0.004 per participant per minute= $0.032.

**Total cost for the call**: $0.22 + $0.008 + $ 0.032+ $0.04= $0.26.


### Inbound: Customer calls an agent from Microsoft Teams

Mae is a customer and calls your US toll-free number acquired through Azure Communication Services from Microsoft Teams. The call is routed to an agent, Matias, who accepts the incoming call. The call lasts for 20 minutes.

:::image type="content" source="media/customer-calls-from-teams.png" alt-text="Pricing example 1-Inbound call from customer through Teams":::


**Cost calculation**

- One participant on Microsoft Teams (Inbound from Mae)x 20 minutes x rate per participant per minute*.
- One participant on the PSTN (inbound from Mae) x 20 minutes x 0.022 per participant per minute = $0.44.
- One participant on VOIP (inbound to Matias) x 20 x 0.004 per participant per minute= $0.08.

*Mae's participation is covered by the Teams license.

**Total cost for the call**: $0.44 + $0.08 = $0.52 + applicable Teams charges.

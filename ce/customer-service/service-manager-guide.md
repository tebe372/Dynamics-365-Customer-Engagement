# Service Manager Guide (Customer Service and Customer Service Hub)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Easily set up and manage your customer service tasks from one place by using Service Management. Set up everything related to customer service, like defining parent-child case hierarchy, creating queues, routing rule sets, rules for automatic case creation, service level agreements (SLAs), entitlements, and customer service schedule. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you have previously installed any portal solution, to create a case in the Customer Service Hub or to use the Merge cases command, you must turn off the **Read-only in mobile** option for the Case entity. More information: [Turn off Read-only in mobile option](../customize/edit-entities.md#enable-or-disable-entity-options).

## Access Service Management

Use the Service manager to set up various service management tasks for customer service. You can access service management using either of the following ways:

- In the Customer Service Hub sitemap, select **...** to go to Service Management. To know more about the Customer Service Hub sitemap, see [Understand the sitemap navigation](customer-service-hub-user-guide-basics.md#understand-the-sitemap-navigation).

# Schedule a service activity

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Use service activity to schedule service appointments by searching for an available time for a service activity. You can either search for an open time using search criteria that, at a minimum, include selecting a service, or you can define a more complex set of criteria. You can also create a service activity without checking for conflicts in the scheduled service. The service activity appears as a color block on the service calendar  
  
> [!NOTE]
> You canâ€™t create a recurring service activity. Create individual service activities as needed.

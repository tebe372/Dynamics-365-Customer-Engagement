# Introduction to migration of legacy Service scheduling data

Using the new scheduling experience in Customer Service Hub, you can schedule all your resources optimally and efficiently to plan service activities for your customers. You can now migrate your data to the new scheduling experience using the data migration wizard in the Customer Service Hub app.

To learn more, see [Understand the new scheduling experience](basics-service-service-scheduling.md).

Consider the following scenarios before you begin migration:

- If you havenâ€™t been using the legacy scheduling experience and you are setting it up for the first time in the Customer Service Hub app, see [Set up the new scheduling experience](basics-service-service-scheduling.md#set-up-the-new-service-scheduling-experience).

    > [!Note]
    > As an admin, you should configure all your entity records in the new experience manually from the user interface. You must follow the order as given in the [Scheduling scenario](basics-service-service-scheduling.md#scheduling-scenario) while configuring entity records in the new scheduling experience.

- If you've been using the legacy scheduling experience and plan to migrate to the new scheduling experience in the Customer Service Hub app, use the migration solution. The new migration package lets you migrate scheduling entity records. To learn more, see [Migrate entity records](migrate-entity-records.md) and [Install Scheduling solution](#install-scheduling-solution).

# Keyboard navigation support in [!INCLUDEpn-dynamics-crm]

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Keyboard shortcuts give you an alternate way to do common tasks, instead of using your mouse or tapping with your finger. And because many keyboard shortcuts are the same across all Microsoft products, some of these might already be familiar to you.

> [!NOTE]
> The shortcut keys described in this section refer to the U.S. keyboard layout. Depending on your country/region and layout, you may not have the same keys. 

## Navigate submenus with a screen reader

If you use a screen reader, follow the steps given below to access any of the submenus that are displayed when you hover the mouse over a navigation link.
1. Navigate between the menu options using standard link navigation.
2. Activate the link by pressing Enter or the space key as you would usually do. A list of submenus will be displayed.
3. To access these submenu options, use the assistive technology (AT) shortcut key to navigate to the next button. For example, if you use the NVDA screen reader, you would use the “b” shortcut key (NVDA+b). To navigate through all the options, press the key repeatedly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>There are several areas in the user interface (UI) that have auto-collapse built in for menus. This  includes the Navigation Bar and Form Navigation. Both expand when clicked, but after 30 seconds of inactivity, the items collapse.

## Navigate through stages of a process using the keyboard

If you’re in a record, for example a lead, this section shows you the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the different stages in the sales process to qualify the lead, and how to make selections in those stages. For example, if you want to move easily from the Qualify stage through to the Close stage, try these keyboard actions:

- After you select a stage, get to the fields by pressing the down arrow.
- If a stage is collapsed, just press Enter to expand it.

> [!NOTE]
> The process name is an icon at the bottom of the page, not the top.

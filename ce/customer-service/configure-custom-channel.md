## Overview

As an organization, you want the ability to integrate your line-of-business (in-house) messaging channels or other messaging channels with Omnichannel for Customer Service. The custom messaging channel capability lets you bring in your own channels, so you can engage better with customers. Here are some of the messaging channel integrations that are supported:

- [Direct Line](bring-your-own-channel.md)
- Telegram

### Value proposition

- Integrate line-of-business (in-house) messaging channels that are specific to your organization.

- Easily configure the administrator experience in the Omnichannel admin center app.

- Create a single and unified agent experience in the Omnichannel for Customer Service app.

## Prerequisite

You must have channels provisioned in your environment. More information: [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](omnichannel-provision-license.md)

## End-to-end walkthrough

1. Register your custom messaging channel

1. Add the custom messaging channel to bot channel registration

1. Create a work stream

## Register your custom messaging channel

**To integrate your messaging channel with Omnichannel for Customer Service**

1. Register your custom channel in **Azure Bot Service** by selecting a multitenant bot. To learn how to register, see [Register a bot with Azure Bot Service](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration).

2. Save the **Microsoft App ID** and **Client secret** values safely for future use. These two values are required to create a custom channel configuration in the Omnichannel admin center app. More information: [Get registration password](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration#get-registration-password).

## Add the messaging channel to bot channel registration

After registering your messaging channel, add the messaging channel to the bot channel registration. More information: [Connect a bot to channels](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-channels)

## Create a workstream

After you add the messaging channel to the Bot Channel registration in Azure Bot Service, create a workstream for the custom channel.

### Configure a workstream

### Create a custom messaging account in Omnichannel Administration

After you create a workstream for a custom channel, you need to create a custom channel with the details of the **Microsoft app ID** and **Client secret** that you retrieved while registering your messaging channel in Azure Bot Service.

To create a custom channel, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Omnichannel Administrator.

2. Select **Custom** under **Channels**.

3. Select **New** in the **Active Custom messaging account** view.

4. In the **New Custom messaging account** page, specify the values for the following fields:

    | Section | Field | Description | Example  value |
    |-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
    | Account details |Name| Specify a name for the custom channel.| Contoso custom channel |
    | Account details |Microsoft app ID| Copy and paste the **Microsoft app ID** that you saved earlier from the Azure Bot Channel Registration page. <br> To learn more, see [Get registration password](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration#get-registration-password). | cae1d83e-8b07-4fca-8072-c2eb3444vxyz |
    | Account details |Client secret| Copy and paste the **Client secret** that you saved earlier from the Azure Bot Channel Registration page.  <br> To learn more, see [Get registration password](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration#get-registration-password).| |


5. Select **Validate app ID + secret**  to validate the **Microsoft app ID** and **Client secret** values. After the validation, a toast notification is displayed. Also, the **Last validated** field shows time and date. This ensures that bots are active and client secret refreshes are consumed.

    > ![Account details in custom channel.](media/custom-channel-1.png "Account details in custom channel")

6. Select **Save** to save the changes. After you save, in the **Callback information** section, the **Message endpoint (URL)** field is generated with a URL. Copy the URL from the field.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Callback information for custom channel.](media/custom-channel-2.png "Callback information for custom channel")

7. Go to the **Azure Portal** > **Bot Channel Registration** page, paste the URL into the **Message endpoint** field, and save the changes.

8. In the **Channels** section, select **New Custom messaging channel**. The **New Custom messaging channel** page is displayed.

   After you create a **Custom messaging account**, you need to create a custom messaging channel, which is the actual channel from which Omnichannel for Customer Service agents will receive messages from the customer.

9. On the **New Custom messaging account** page, specify the values for the following fields:

    | Section | Field | Description | Example  value |
    |-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
    | Details | Name | Specify a name for the custom channel | Contoso channel |
    | Details | Custom Messaging Account | The **Custom messaging account** field is populated. However, you can change the value using the lookup. | Contoso custom channel |
    | Details | Channel ID | Select a channel from the list. The list might contain line-of-business (in-house) messaging or another messaging channel. | Telegram |
    | Work distribution | Work stream | Select a workstream from the lookup. | Contoso custom channel work stream |

    > [!Note]
    > A **Custom messaging account** can have multiple unique channel IDs. Don't add two or more same Channel IDs to a **Custom messaging account** because the Azure Bot Framework supports only one messaging account per App ID. For example, for **Contoso custom account**, you can't add two or more **Telegram** Channel IDs.


    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![General tab page for custom channel.](media/custom-channel-3.png "General tab page for custom channel") 

10. Optionally, on the **Surveys** tab, [configure a post-conversation survey](configure-post-conversation-survey.md).

11. Select **Save** to save the custom messaging channel.

12. Select the back button on the browser to go to the custom messaging account page. You can see that the custom messaging channel is added in the **Channels** section.

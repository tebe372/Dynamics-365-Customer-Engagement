## Prerequisites

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- A custom page or a Power Apps component framework control to be hosted as a custom productivity tool. To learn more, see [Overview of custom pages for model-driven apps](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-app-page-overview) and [Power Apps component framework](/power-apps/developer/component-framework/overview).

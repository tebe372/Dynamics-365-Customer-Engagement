# Overview of Smart assist

> [!Note]
> This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.

Smart assist is an intelligent assistant that is designed to help agents be more productive as they resolve customer issues by providing real-time suggestions of the best course of actions to take while working on an assigned case. It shows relevant, AI-generated suggestions, such as knowledge articles and similar cases that match the context of the active case.

In the Customer Service workspace application, **Smart assist** appears on the productivity pane on the right-hand side of the session.

> [!Important]
> For preview, the **productivity pane** will be automatically enabled and will expand, showing the **Smart assist** tab whenever an active case is opened as a new session using the Shift+click action.

Smart assist displays the relevant suggestions as individual cards that are grouped as either Knowledge articles or Similar cases suggestions. For more information, see [View AI-suggested cases in knowledge articles](csw-view-ai-suggested-cases-knowledge-articles.md).

## Use the productivity pane to guide agents

The productivity pane in the Customer Service workspace is an auxiliary work area that contains productivity tools that support or expedite an agent&#39;s task, when resolving customer issues.

The productivity pane displays the **Smart assist** control, where agents can quickly view and interact with relevant AI-generated knowledge articles and similar cases suggestions for the case they are working on.

> [!Important]
> For preview, the **productivity pane** will be automatically enabled and will expand, showing the **Smart assist tab**, whenever an active case is opened as a new session using the Shift+click action.

> [!Important]
> The productivity pane only displays information (for example, knowledge article and similar case suggestions) for the first tab (referred to as the anchor tab) of an active case session.

The productivity pane has two modes: expanded and collapsed. These modes are preserved in different sessions. For example, say in session A you expanded the pane, but while in session B, you collapsed it. When you switch from session A to session B, the pane mode changes from expanded to collapsed. Then if you switch back to session A, the pane is still in its expanded mode.

You can use the arrow to set the mode of the productivity pane.

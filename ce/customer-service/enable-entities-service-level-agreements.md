# Enable entities for service level agreements

Service level agreements are not just important in the customer service space, but also for sales and marketing to ensure efficient handling of leads from start to finish.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only enhanced SLAs can be created for other entities. A standard SLA can be created only for the Case entity.

## Entities (record types) that support SLAs

With Customer Service, you can create enhanced SLAs for entities that are enabled for SLA. A system administrator or customizer can enable SLAs for the following entities:  

- Account  

- Contact  

- Order  

- Invoice  

- Quote  

- Opportunity  

- Lead

- Activity entities such as Email, PhoneCall, and Appointment&mdash;but not RecurringAppointment or its instances  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  SLAs can also be enabled for custom entities and custom activities.

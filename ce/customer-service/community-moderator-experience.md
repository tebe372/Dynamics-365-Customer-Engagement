## Content moderation in Customer Service Community

Forum owners and moderators will use Customer Service Community to manage and moderate content. 
They can do the following tasks:
-	Edit a forum's name and description.
-	Edit the idea name and description, and update fields including category, group, and stage.
-	Add a new moderator response to idea.
- Manage comments, including adding a moderator response to comment and manage comment flags.
- Manage idea votes.
- Manage idea flags.

To achieve above:
1. Navigate to the forum, select the **Forum** tab to update forum Name and Description.
2. Select the **Ideas** tab, and then select the idea you want to edit.
3. Update the fields as desired. You can also add a **Moderator Response** and select **Response Generic Author**. 
   **Response Generic Author** enables you to associate a generic role to your response in portal, rather than show your name. The list of  generic roles is managed by your admin.
4. To manage idea votes, select the **Votes** tab. A vote value can be either 0 (no vote) or 1 (a single upvote).
5. From the portal, end users can flag ideas as inappropriate. Forum owners and moderators can go to **Flags** tab to view and manage idea flags.
6. Go to the **Comments** tab to manage end user comments. Under **Active comments on idea**, select the comment you want to edit, and then select **Edit**. Under **Moderator Response**, in the **Comments** field, type the desired response. Go to **Flags** tab to manage flags on the selected comment.


## Collections

Forum owners and moderators can create a collection to combine duplicate or related ideas. Successfully-created collections will show in the portal, and all the associated ideas (also called "children ideas") will be removed. Note that users who contributed to the children ideas can still view them (read only) in **My Content** page. 

Follow these steps to create a collection:
1. On the left-side navigation panel, select **Collections**, and then select **+ New**.
2. Select the forum you want to combine ideas from, and then select **Next**.
3. Select plus sign (+) to add ideas from **Active ideas in this forum** list to the collection. Utilize seach in long lists. Added ideas will show in the **Collection ideas** list. 
4. When you're done adding ideas, select **Next**.
5. Add a **Title** and **Description** for the new collection. You can also copy these fields from one of the children ideas.
6. You can optionally select the **Stage**, **Category**, and **Group**, and then select **Next**.
7. Confirm the details are correct, and then select **Next**.
8. Wait for the status of the new collection to change from **In-progress** to **Success**. You can refresh the page to get the latest status.

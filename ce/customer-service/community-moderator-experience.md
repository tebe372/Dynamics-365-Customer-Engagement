## Content moderation in Customer Service Community

Forum owners and moderators will use Customer Service Community to manage and moderate content. 
They can do the following tasks:
•	Edit a forum's name and description.
•	Edit the idea name and description, and update fields including category, group, and stage.
•	Add a new moderator response to idea.
•	Manage comments, including adding a moderator response to comment and manage comment flags.
•	Manage idea votes.
•	Manage idea flags.

To update idea fields:
1. Navigate to the forum, select the **Ideas** tab, and then select the idea you want to edit.
2. Update the fields as desired. You can also add a **Moderator Response** and select **Response Generic Author**. 
   **Response Generic Author** enables you to associate a generic role with your response, rather than use your username when displayed to end users in the portal.
3. Go to the **Comments** tab to manage end user comments. Under **Active comments on idea**, sSelect the comment you want to edit, and then select **Edit**.
4. Under **Moderator Response**, in the **Comments** field, type the desired response, and manage comment flags.
5. To manage votes, select the **Votes** tab. A vote value can be either 0 (no vote) or 1 (a single upvote).
6. From the portal, end users can flag ideas as inappropriate. Forum owners and moderators can go to **Flags** tab to view and manage these flags.

## Collections

Forum owners and moderators can create a collection to combine duplicate or related ideas. Successfully-created collections will show in the portal, and all the associated ideas (also called "children ideas") will be removed. Note that users who contributed to the children ideas can still view them (read only) in My Content page. 

Follow these steps to create a collection:
1. On the left-side navigation panel, select **Collections**, and then select **+ New**.
2. Select the forum you want to select children ideas from, and then select **Next**.
3. Select **+** to add ideas from the active ideas list to the collection. Added ideas will show in the collection ideas list. 
4. When you're done adding ideas, select **Next**.
5. Add a title and description for the new collection. You can also copy the title and description from one of the children ideas.
6. You can optionally select the **Stage**, **Category**, and **Group**, and then select **Next**.
7. Confirm the details are correct, and then select **Next**.
8. Wait for the status to change from **In-progress** to **Success**. You can refresh the page to get the latest status.

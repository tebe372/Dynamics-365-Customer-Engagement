# Configure an SMS channel using Azure Communication Services

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

This article discusses how you can configure an SMS channel using Azure Communication Services.

## Prerequisites

- Purchase and install the voice channel for Dynamics 365 Customer Service. More information: [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](omnichannel-provision-license.md) and [Install voice channel](voice-channel-install.md)
- Connect to Azure Communication Services. More information: [Connect to Azure Communication Services](voice-channel-acs-resource.md)
  
   If you’ve connected your existing Azure resource, ensure that you’ve enabled SMS services. More information: [Enable call recording and SMS services](voice-channel-connect-existing-resource.md#enable-call-recording-and-sms-services)
- Set up a phone number that's enabled for SMS services. Ensure that you select **Send SMS** or **Send and receive SMS** options when you choose your phone number features in Customer Service admin center or Omnichannel admin center. More information: [Acquire new phone numbers](voice-channel-manage-phone-numbers.md#acquire-new-phone-numbers)
   
    If you're using an existing phone number that's not enabled for SMS, then you can upgrade your plan. More information: [Edit phone numbers](voice-channel-manage-phone-numbers.md#edit-phone-numbers)

- Create a workstream for the SMS channel. More information: [Create a workstream for the SMS channel](create-workstreams.md)

# Configure an SMS channel using Azure Communication Services

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The SMS channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service allows your organization to connect to customers via text messages. Your customers can send text messages and connect with an appropriate customer service agent. Agents can view incoming SMS requests on their dashboard and respond accordingly. You can use the same phone number for both the SMS channel, and for inbound and outbound calling in the voice channel.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - SMS is currently available for toll-free numbers in the United States only, and only works for inbound communication. Outbound (agent-initiated) SMS is not currently supported.
> - SMS is not supported with [Azure direct routing](/azure/communication-services/concepts/telephony-sms/telephony-concept#azure-direct-routing).

## Prerequisites

- [Connect to Azure Communication Services](voice-channel-acs-resource.md).  
  
   If you’ve connected your existing Azure resource, ensure that you’ve [created an event subscription endpoint for SMS](voice-channel-sub-endpoints.md#create-event-subscription-endpoint-for-sms).
- Set up a phone number that's enabled for SMS services. Ensure that you select **Send SMS** or **Send and receive SMS** options when you choose your phone number features in Omnichannel admin center or Customer Service admin center app. More information: [Acquire new phone numbers](voice-channel-manage-phone-numbers.md#acquire-new-phone-numbers)
   
    If you're using an existing phone number that's not enabled for SMS, then you can upgrade your plan. More information: [Edit phone numbers](voice-channel-manage-phone-numbers.md#edit-phone-numbers)

## Configure the workstream for the SMS channel

[Create a workstream for the SMS channel](create-workstreams.md), and then perform the following steps:

1. Go to the **Workstreams** page, and open the workstream that you created.

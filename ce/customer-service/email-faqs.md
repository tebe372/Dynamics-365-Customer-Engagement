4.	Select ![More commands icon](media\timeline-more-commands-icon.png "more commands") **More Options** on **Customer Service Hub**.

5.	On the **App Designer** drop-down menu, select **Open**. 

6.	On the site map, select the edit feature. 

7.	Under the **Email** form selector, select the drop-down menu to display the **Email** forms you have enabled.

    If the form isn't displayed in the list, it hasn't been enabled.

  ## Known issues
  
  - Verbatim HTML tags, such as href=””, have their value removed if they aren't encoded in the experience by email templates from the legacy app. This is because the content sanitation library was upgraded to include this safety improvement in Dynamics 365. You can resolve this issue by manually encoding the value.

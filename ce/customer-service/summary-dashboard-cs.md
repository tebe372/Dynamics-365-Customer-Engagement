# Summary dashboard

The Summary dashboard gives you a broad overview of the customer service experience in your organization. It uses AI to provide insights into which topics are generating the highest volume and which topics are emerging with the highest rate of change in volume.

![Summary dashboard](media/summary-dashboard-analytics-cs.png "View the Summary dashboard")

To view the Summary dashboard, go to Customer Service historical analytics and select **Summary** at the top of the workspace. 

The KPI summary dashboard includes a variety of charts with graphical views of your system's key performance indicators. 

The case volume drivers and emerging case volume by topic charts use natural language understanding to group support cases as topics that are a collection of related cases. These charts show you the customer support topics that are generating the most volume and emerging topics with the highest rate of change in volume, helping you identify areas for improvement that can have the greatest impact on system performance.

By default, the dashboard shows you KPIs for the past month and for all channels, queues, and agents in your system. The data filtering options allow you to select data for specific time periods, channels, queues, and agents. To filter data by duration, channel, queue, or agent, select a value from the respective drop-down list. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you switch to a different dashboard, the filter you specify persists and is applied to the data on all dashboards.


## Key insights card

The Key insights card has two areas.

- **KPI insights**: Important subjects that impact performance, such as CSAT pertaining to priority, volume pertaining to channel, and open cases pertaining to queues.

- **Topics to watch**: Topics that rank high across the three key areas to make it easier for customer service managers to discover top issues.

# Overview of bots

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

A bot is a program that provides automated responses in a conversational manner to a customer. It can also help resolve customer queries by using case deflection. A bot can also collect basic information from a customer and then provide it to a customer service agent to work further on the issue raised by the customer.  

A bot eases the load on your customer service agents by handling basic queries. This saves your agents' time so they can work on more complex issues. You can configure your bots to escalate a query to a human agent as required, or when requested by the customer.

In Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can integrate bots to start a conversation with the customer, provide automated responses, and then transfer the conversation to a human agent, if required.

# Entity Navigation

Navigational functionality is now consistent across all entities streamlining the experience for agents to improve productivity.  These improvements mitigate the need for agents to toggle back and forth between screens and allows them to easily view and sort through queue records, activities, and cases.  

The fly out icon ![fly out icon](channel-integration-framework\media\Nav-icon.png "fly out icon") is located in the top nav bar across all entities.

When clicked, the fly out expands to display a list, such as queue records, which the agent can quickly scroll through to find information faster and is displayed when clicked.

Agents can tailor what is displayed by creating and managing their queues and cases to organize, prioritize, and monitor work.

# Customize live chat widget for mobile apps

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

This topic explains how you can use the Omnichannel Chat SDK to customize the live chat widget for mobile apps. Alternatively, render the chat widget in your apps using embedded code.

## Download Omnichannel Chat SDK

We recommend that you download the latest version of the Omnichannel Chat SDK package to implement the latest features. For download instructions and information, go to the [Omnichannel Chat SDK Installation page on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/omnichannel-chat-sdk#installation).

> [!Note]
> To implement the Azure Bot Service channel, you'll need Omnichannel Chat SDK 1.0.0.

## Customize live chat widget using Omnichannel Chat SDK

Use the Omnichannel Chat SDK to create Omnichannel for Customer Service chat widgets in mobile apps. The open-source Omnichannel Chat SDK comes with a fully customizable user interface with Omnichannel chat methods and features. The SDK is supported on React Native, and therefore works for iOS and Android apps, and also on web browsers.

Examples of sample apps in the Omnichannel Chat SDK include:

- React-Native App: [gifted-chat](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat)

- Web Reference App: [BotFramework-WebChat](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat)

To view all sample apps, go to [Chat SDK Sample Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/omnichannel-chat-sdk/tree/main/samples).

## Render the live chat widget using embedded code

If the SDK does not meet your requirements, you can embed a live chat widget code in your mobile app. However, embedding a chat widget code has many more limitations and restrictions compared to using the Omnichannel Chat SDK, such as reduced performance, limited mobile usability, and unavailable features.

> [!NOTE]
> - Live chat widget features&mdash;escalating to voice and video, and downloading the chat transcript&mdash;aren't supported on the mobile apps.

Use the `WebView` component of your mobile operation system language to enable rendering of the web version of the chat widget on mobile devices. A `WebView` is an embedded browser that enables a native application to display web content. The WebView capability is offered on both Android and iOS.

The following sample code renders the chat widget in a mobile application.

```kotlin
var html: String = """
        <html>
            <head>
                <meta http-equiv="no-cache">
                <meta http-equiv="Expires" content="-1">
                <meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache">
                <script 
                    type="text/javascript"
                    src = "Use src from widget code snippet"
                    id = Microsoft_Omnichannel_LCWidget
                    data-app-id = "Use data-app-Id from widget code snippet"
                    data-org-id = "Use data-org-Id from widget code snippet"
                    data-org-url = "Use data-org-url from widget code snippet"
                    data-render-mobile = "true"
                    data-hide-chat-button = "true"
                    data-color-override = "desired color code eg. #008577">
                </script>
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>
    """.trimIndent()
    var baseUrl: String = "Get baseUrl from data-org-url eg. https://oc-cdn-ocprod.azureedge.net"
    chatWebView.loadDataWithBaseURL(baseUrl,html, "text/html", null, baseUrl)
```

You can optimize the rendering of the chat widget for mobile web experience by using data tags such as `data-hide-chat-button` and `data-render-mobile`, along with a few APIs and events provided by the [live chat widget client SDK](developer/omnichannel-reference.md). More information: [Customize a chat widget using data tags](customize-chat-widget.md)

The usage of the `data-hide-chat-button` data tag in the preceding sample code hides the default open chat button available in the live chat widget. So instead of using the default chat button, you can add a button that aligns with the mobile app. To open a chat session, you can call the [startChat](developer/reference/methods/startchat.md) method when the new chat button is selected.

```javascript
chatWebView.evaluateJavascript(
    "Microsoft.Omnichannel.LiveChatWidget.SDK.closeChat();",
    null
)
```

You can use the `data-render-mobile` data tag to optimize the rendering of the live chat widget on mobile. For example, it hides the header of the chat widget. Along with the header, the **Close (X)** button also goes away. To close the chat, you have to create an "end chat" button in the mobile app and call the [closeChat](developer/reference/methods/closechat.md) method on the click event.

```javascript
chatWebView.evaluateJavascript(
    "Microsoft.Omnichannel.LiveChatWidget.SDK.closeChat();", null)
```

The preceding code covers the scenario where the user of the mobile app ends the chat. However, in another scenario, where an agent ends the conversation, you can listen for the [lcw:threadUpdate](developer/reference/events/lcw-threadupdate.md) event and call the [closeChat](developer/reference/methods/closechat.md) method to end the conversation from the client side, as shown in the following code.

```javascript
chatWebView.evaluateJavascript(
    "window.addEventListener(\"lcw:threadUpdate\", function(){Microsoft.Omnichannel.LiveChatWidget.SDK.closeChat();})", null)
```

When the chat is closed, the live chat widget triggers the [lcw:closeChat](developer/reference/events/lcw-closechat.md) event. You can listen for this event, and perform any post-chat steps if required.

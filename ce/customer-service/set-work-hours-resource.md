# Set work hours to define availability

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can set up and define the hours a resource is available. By default, the resources are set up for a 7-days-a-week, 24-hour schedule. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the Customer Engagement apps version 9.1 release, the new Service Scheduling is now available in the Customer Service Hub sitemap. We recommend that you define work hours using the new experience. 
  
## Set work hours for a resource  
  
1. In the Customer Service Hub sitemap, go to **Service Scheduling**.
2. From the list of entity records, select **Scheduling > Resources**. 
  
4.  Open the resource record you want to set work hours for.  
  
6.  Select **Show Work Hours**.  
  
7.  From the **Set up** drop-down list, choose the schedule display as required.
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Monthly schedules are the default display; you can choose weekly and daily schedules.  
  
8.  Double-click a date on the calendar that is the first day for which you want to set work hours.  
  
9. In the **Edit Schedule** dialog box, select one of the following and then select **OK**.  
  
    - **This date only**  
  
         This option changes only the selected day.  
  
         Skip to step 12.  
  
    - **From \<this date> onward**  
  
         This option changes only the schedule going forward.  
  
    - **Entire recurring weekly schedule from start to end**  
  
         This option changes this entire schedule from the start to end date.  
  
         Selecting this option might change past days, which could affect reports regarding hours worked in the past.  
  
10. In the **Weekly Schedule** dialog box, in the **Set the recurring weekly schedule** section, select one of the following:  
  
    - **Are the same each day**

    - **Vary by day**  
  
         The new schedule is different for one or more days of the week. After you select this option, select the days of the week that the resource is available.  
  
    - **None. User is not working**  
  
         The new schedule includes time that the resource is not working.

         You cannot change the date the schedule ends. To end a schedule, you must define a new schedule on that date.  
  
11. Choose the work hours link for the schedule you want to modify.  
  
     If work hours have not been set previously, the link is displayed as "Set Work Hours."

# Preview: Configure topic clustering for cases in for Customer Service Hub and Customer Service workspace

Previews are provided "as-is," "with all faults," "as available," and without warranty.
> - This preview feature does not come with technical support and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won't be able to help you with issues or questions.  If Microsoft does elect to provide any type of support, such support is provided "as is," "with all faults," and without warranty, and may be discontinued at any time.
> - Previews are not meant for production use, especially to process Personal Data or other data that is subject to heightened compliance requirements, and any use of "live" or production data is at your sole risk.

Customer Service historical analytics uses artificial intelligence to automatically group your cases into topics using natural language understanding. Topics enable you to discover and adapt to current and emerging trends, improve brand sentiment, and identify problem areas. By pinpointing and fixing issues before they impact customers, you can deliver better customer service experiences. 

The AI-driven technology empowers informed decision-making about how to improve resolution rates, reduce wait times, and decrease customer service costs. You can use case resolution insights, backlog trends, and historical comparisons to evaluate agent performance and business impact, and address inefficiencies in your system.

## Enable topic clustering for cases

1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 as an administrator, and go to Customer Service Hub.

2. In the **Change area**, select **Service Management**.

3. Under **Analytics and Insights**, select **Settings**. The **Analytics and insights settings** page is displayed.

4. On the right side of **Topic clustering for case (preview)**, select **Manage**.

5. On the **Topic clustering for case** page, toggle **Status** to **Enabled**.

6. Select **Save** or **Save & Close**.


## Summary and Model Run Summary views

   > ![Summary and Model Run Summary](media/summary-model-run.png "Summary and Model Run Summary views")

The Summary and Model Run Summary views provide key information about how the topic model is operating.

| View | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Status | Whether the feature is enabled or disabled.|
| Data attributes used | Which text field from the Case entity is used for topic generation. |
| Topics generated | The total number of topics generated by the model. |
| Cases associated to a topic | The percentage of cases that were considered for topic generation and classified to a topic.|
| Last successful run | Timestamp of the last time new cases were processed. |
| Run frequency | The cadence in which new cases are processed and tagged with topics. |


## Data mapping

   > ![Data mapping](media/data-mapping-cs.png "Data mapping configuration")

Data mapping enables you to choose which text field where agents in your organization are most likely to describe the reason why a customer reached out to support. By default, the Case Title attribute is used, but this setting enables you to select and string attribute in the Case entity.

#### Improve data quality by cleaning support case data

Customer Service Insights uses artificial intelligence technology to give you insights into your customer service data by grouping support cases as topics that are a collection of related cases. This can help you identify areas for improvement that can have the greatest impact on system performance. 

The AI Insights charts displayed on the Customer Service Insights dashboards are generated by applying language understanding technology to the titles of support cases. However, the results can be misleading if the titles include extraneous information such as product name, case status, or ticket number tags. You can improve the quality of the results displayed in AI Insights charts by specifying Data Cleaning settings to disregard tags in titles when they are grouped into topics, as well as specific phrases that should be ignored. Note that when you choose to apply both options, sections are ignored first, followed by phrases. 


## Language availability for topics 

The topics capability in the Customer Service historical analytics reports comes with a natural language understanding model that can understand the text semantics and intent in the following languages: 

- English 
- French 
- German 
- Italian 
- Japanese 
- Portuguese 
- Simplified Chinese 
- Spanish 

The language-specific models enable better language understanding capability for the corresponding languages. When Customer Service Insights refreshes your workspace and processes the case data, it will automatically detect the primary languages used in your cases. 

If more than 70% of the cases are in languages supported by a specific language model, that model will be used to discover topics from all of your cases; otherwise, a mixed-language model is used. 

For example, if you have more than 70% of cases detected in English, the English language model will be used to process all of your cases. If more than 70% of your cases are in Spanish, or most in Spanish with some English cases (since all language models have the capability to process English), the Spanish model will be used to process all of your cases.

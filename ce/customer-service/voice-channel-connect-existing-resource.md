# Advanced: Connect using an existing Azure resource

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

You can connect your voice or SMS channels to Azure Communication Services using an existing Azure resource from any of your Azure subscriptions, *available under any tenant*. If you disconnected a resource and want to use it now, you can do so using this option.

## Prerequisites

Before you connect an existing Azure resource to Azure Communication Services, you must perform the following steps.

- Confirm the **Get started** button to connect to an existing Azure resource is visible on the **Phone numbers** page. The **Get Started** button appears only when:
  - The trial has ended after the free calling time has elapsed.
  - You've manually ended the trial.
  - You've [disconnected from the Azure resource](voice-channel-disconnect-from-acs.md).
- Get the name and ID of your Azure resource from the Azure portal > **Settings** > **Properties**.
- [Get the connection string of your Azure resource](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp#access-your-connection-strings-and-service-endpoints).
- [Get the application (client) ID and tenant (directory) ID for your registered app](#get-application-and-tenant-ids-from-the-azure-portal).
- Confirm that you have [permissions to access secure columns](add-users-assign-roles.md#configure-permissions-to-access-secure-columns).

## Connect using an existing Azure resource

1. In Dynamics 365 Customer Service admin center or Omnichannel admin center, open the phone number settings.

    - Customer Service admin center:

        1. In the site map, under **Customer support**, select **Channels**.
        2. To the right of **Phone numbers**, select **Manage**.

    - Omnichannel admin center: In the site map, under **General settings**, select **Phone numbers**, and then select **Get started**.

1. Select **Use existing resource**.

1. Fill in the following fields using the resource information you retrieved from the Azure portal:
   - **ACS Resource Name**: Enter the resource name.
   - **ACS Resource ID**: Enter the resource ID.
   - **Connection string**: Enter the connection string.
   - **Event grid app id**: Enter the application (client) ID.
   - **Event grid app tenant id**: Enter the tenant (directory) ID.

1. Select **Connect** to connect the resource to Azure Communication Services.

1. Select **Add number**.

1. [Add a new phone number](voice-channel-manage-phone-numbers.md#acquire-new-phone-numbers).

Next, [configure voice workstream settings](create-workstreams.md) for the phone number, set up [inbound](voice-channel-route-queues.md) and [outbound](voice-channel-outbound-calling.md) calling, and enable call recording and SMS services.

### Enable call recording and SMS services

Azure Communication Services integrates with [Azure Event Grid](/azure/event-grid/overview) to send real-time notifications for chat, telephony, SMS, video, and voice calling events. The Azure Event Grid, in turn, uses event subscriptions to route event messages to subscribers.

To enable call recording and SMS services, you must first configure your applications to listen to Azure Communication Services events by registering [Event Grid system topics](/azure/event-grid/system-topics). Then, subscribe to the specific call recording or SMS events by creating Event Grid subscriptions on the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - You can only set one web hook endpoint at a time using the following procedure. To enable both SMS and call recording services, you must perform the procedure two times to set a web hook endpoint for each service.
> - When you connect your event subscription, you must use the same application (client) ID and tenant (directory) ID for the app registration as you did when you first connected to your Azure resource. To quickly get the event grid app and tenant IDs from the Power Apps portal, see [Get event grid app and tenant IDs from the Power Apps portal](#get-event-grid-app-and-tenant-ids-from-the-power-apps-portal).

1. Open the **Event Grid System Topics** service on the Azure portal.

1. [Create and deploy an Event Grid system topic](/azure/event-grid/create-view-manage-system-topics#create-a-system-topic).

1. On the **Event Grid System Topic** page, select the **Subscription** link.

1. In the resource subscription page, select **Settings** > **Resource providers**, and then check whether the **Microsoft.EventGrid** provider is listed as **Registered**. If the Event Grid isn't registered, then select the record, and then select **Re-register** to register it.

1. Open the resource on the Azure portal. Select **Events**, and then select **Event Subscription**.

1. Enter the following details in the **Basic** tab:
    - **Name**: Enter a name for the recording event subscription.
    - **Event Schema**: Select **Event Grid Schema** in the list.
    - **Topic Types**: Select **Azure Communication Services** in the list.
    - **Subscription**: Select your subscription in the list.
    - **Resource Group**: Select the resource group.
    - **Resource**: Select the resource.
    - **System Topic Name**: This field is automatically populated with the system topic name you created. However, if you see multiple values, select the specific system topic name from the list.
    - **Filter to Event Types**: You can filter events for either call recording or SMS services.
        - To filter event types for recording services, select **Recording File Status Updated (Preview)** in the list.
        - To filter event types for SMS services, select **SMS Received** and **SMS Delivery Report Received** in the list.
    - **Endpoint Type**: Select **Web Hook** in the list.
    - **Endpoint**: Select **Select an endpoint**, and then enter the recording or SMS web hook endpoint:
        - To enable recording services, [get the **Recording Web Hook Endpoint**](#get-the-subscriber-endpoint-for-recording), paste the value in **Subscriber Endpoint**, and then select **Confirm Selection**.
        - To enable SMS services, [get the **SMS Web Hook Endpoint**](#get-the-subscriber-endpoint-for-sms), paste the value in **Subscriber Endpoint**, and then select **Confirm Selection**.

1. Select the **Additional Features** tab. Select the **Use AAD authentication** checkbox, and enter the following details:

   - **AAD Tenant ID**: Enter the tenant (directory) ID of your Azure resource.
   - **AAD Application ID or URI**: Enter the application (client) ID of your Azure resource.

1. Select **Create** to create the event subscription endpoint for recording.

   It can take up to 15 minutes to sync. If you get an error like "Webhook validation handshake failed," then retry this step after a few minutes.

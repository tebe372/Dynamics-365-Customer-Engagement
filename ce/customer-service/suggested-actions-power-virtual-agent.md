Suggested actions enable your bot to present buttons or options that the user can tap to provide input. Suggested actions appear close to the composer and enhance user experience. These inputs are provided within the chat window and they enable the user to answer a question or make a selection with a tap of a button, rather than having to type a response with a keyboard.

Suggested actions are displayed vertically to enhance user experience and to promote easy readability. More information: [Customize chat widget](customize-chat-widget.md)

The suggested actions feature is now supported in Microsoft Teams along with other asynchronous chat channels.

## Overview



## Slugs

Slug is the replacement parameter that Channel Integration Framework populates at the run time based on the context variables.

The notification shows certain fields and values, which are called **Field header** and **Value** respectively.

For example, Kenny Smith, a customer, initiated a conversation and when the agent sees the notification, it displays **Customer Name** as **Kenny Smith**.

Here, **Field header** is **Customer Name** and the **Value** is **Kenny Smith**.

For Channel Integration Framework to identify the name of the customer as **Kenny Smith**, as an administrator, you must configure slugs as the value. The Channel Integration Framework replaces the slug with the actual value that was extracted based on the context variables.

Channel Integration Framework supports the following slugs.

| Slug | Description |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| `{customerName}` | Name of the customer who initiated the conversation. |
| `{caseId}` | Unique Id of a case. The system displays the case Id only if a cased linked to the conversation. |
| `{caseTitle}` | Title of the case. The system displays the title of the case only if a cased linked to the conversation. |
| `{queueId}` | Unique Id of a queue. |
| `{visitorLanguage}` | The language of the customer who initiated the conversation. |
| `{visitorDevice}` | The device of the customer who initiated the conversation. |
| `{entityRoutingLogicalName}` | Name of the entity if the notification is for a entity records. |
| `{entityRoutingRecordId}` | Unique Id of the entity record if the notification is for a entity records. To learn more, see [Entity records routing](../../omnichannel/administrator/entity-channel.md). |
| `{customerEntityName}` | Name of the entity (contact or account entity) if the customer is authenticated. |
| `{customerRecordId}` | Unique Id of t.he entity (contact or account entity) if the customer is authenticated. |
| `{<name of the pre-chat survey questions>}` | All the pre-chat survey questions that are configured for a workstream will have the slug name as the name of the question. |

# Preview: Onboard your organization to Channel Integration Framework Version 2.0 flight

Before you go to AppSource to install Channel Integration Framework version 2.0, you will need to onboard your organization to the version 2.0 flight. Follow the steps given below to onboard your organization to Channel Integration Framework Version 2.0 flight.

1. Launch Windows Powershell Prompt and enter the list of commands given below.

2. `install-module Microsoft.Xrm.OnlineManagementAPI -Scope CurrentUser -force`

3. `$user = “<your-username>”`

4. `$password = “<your-password>”`

5. `$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($user, (ConvertTo-SecureString $password –ASPlainText –Force))`

6. Create a `url` variable and assign it the Service URL based on the region of your organization.  You can find the value for your region here: [Get started with Online Management API](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/online-management-api/get-started-online-management-api). `$url = “https://admin.services.crm.dynamics.com”` 

7. Get the CIFramework_Preview_Flight Id by executing the following command. `Get-CrmFlights -ApiUrl $url -Credential $cred`

8. Add your organization to the flight by executing the following command. `Add-CrmFlightAudience -ApiUrl $url -FlightId "<flight Id>" -InstanceId "<org Id>" -Credential $cred`

If you want to opt out of the public preview flight, execute the following command. `Remove-CrmFlightAudience -ApiUrl $url -Credential $cred -FlightId "<flight Id>" -InstanceId "<org Id>"`.

After your organization is added to the flight, you can proceed to install the Channel Integration Framework Version 2.0 solution from AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> The base version of Channel Integration Framework version 2.0 solution is 9.2.0.49. Upgrades to the solution take place through a patch solution that is shipped within the package. This means that installation of public preview updates will fail if you have a higher version of CIF package installed. In this case, delete the original CIF solution from your organization, and then re-install the package from AppSource.
>
> You will not be able to see available upgrades for CIF solution in Dynamics 365 Admin Center if your solution version is 9.2.0.49. You can get the latest upgrades from AppSource.

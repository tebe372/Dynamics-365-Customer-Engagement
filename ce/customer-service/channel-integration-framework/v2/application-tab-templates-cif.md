# Manage application tab templates

## Overview

Application tab templates provide the type of applications you want to open when a session is started. Each application type has a predefined set of parameters associated with it.

The horizontal bar below the model-driven app navigation bar is called the application tab panel. Every customer session has at least one application tab that is not closable; it is called **Anchor Tab**. That is, when a session is started, by default the system opens an application in the application tab panel. In addition, the system might open a few other applications that system opens by default based on the configuration.

With the application tab templates, you can define the applications that are available for a session and then associate the applications with a session. 

For example, you can create the **Dashboard** application type and associate it with chat and SMS sessions. Now, when an agent accepts a notification from  the chat or SMS channels, a session starts and by default the **Customer summary** page loads.

As an administrator, you can create multiple application tab templates.

## Create an application tab template

To create or manage an application tab template, go to the app profile manager. For more information, see [Create an application tab template](../app-profile-manager/application-tab-templates#create-an-application-tab-template.md) in the app profile manager documentation.

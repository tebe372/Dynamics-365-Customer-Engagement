# Configure channel provider using app profile manager

The app profile manager is an out-of-the-box solution that lets you create targeted app experiences for agents and supervisors. More information: [App profile manager](../../../app-profile-manager/overview.md).

Channel Integration Framework version 2.0 is for multi-session applications such as Omnichannel for Customer Service and Customer Service workspace. Use the app profile manager as follows to configure a third-party voice channel provider with a multi-session application:

1. Sign in to your [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) portal.

2. Under the available apps, select the ellipses to the right of **Omnichannel for Customer Service** or **Customer service workspace**.

3. On the menu that appears, select **App profile manager**.

4. Select **App profiles** from the site map, and then, select your app profile.

5. Select the **Channels** tab.

6. Select **Add channel providers** and then, select **Create a new channel provider in Unified Interface**. The **New Channel Provider** page opens in a new tab.

# Configure channel providers in Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0

Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0 is intended for multisession applications such as Omnichannel for Customer Service and Customer Service workspace. You can configure channel providers for multisession applications either using Customer Service admin center or Power Apps.

More information: 
- [Agent experience profiles](../../../app-profile-manager/overview.md)
- [Customer Service admin center](../../../customer-service/cs-admin-center.md)

## Configure a third-party channel provider

   ### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)
   
    1. In the site map, select **Workspaces** in **Agent experience**. The **Workspaces** page opens.
    
    2. Select **Manage** for **Third party voice channel provider**.
    
    3. Select a provider from the **Active Channel Providers** list and select **Edit**, or select **New** to add a new channel provider.

    ### [Power Apps](#tab/appprofilemanager)    
    1. Sign in to the [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) portal.

2. Enter or update the following details:

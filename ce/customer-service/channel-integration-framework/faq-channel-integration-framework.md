For the supported browsers information, see the following articles:

- [System requirements for Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0](system-requirements-channel-integration-framework.md)
- [System requirements for Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 1.0](v2/system-requirements-channel-integration-framework-v2.md)

### Can partners package solutions that have a dependency on the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework solution, together with the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework solution?

No, the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework solution should not be bundled with another solution. Partners can create solutions that add a check to their package looking for the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework solution (also mentioning the minimum supported version), which causes the installation to fail in case the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework solution is not present.

Also, you can add Configuration Experience to the acquired flow that'll allow the solution to detect the state of the target instance, and decide how to install. This will also let the solution perform any additional setup or license acquisition remotely, before installation.

## Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0

### What are the new changes to the Channel Integration Framework app?

Channel Integration Framework model-driven app is only applicable to configure channel providers for single session Dynamics 365 model-driven apps. The templates (Session, Notification, and Application tab) will not be available in the Channel Integration Framework app.

### My organization is using Channel Integration Framework 1.0. Does the new version impact my organization?

No. There is no impact on Channel Integration Framework 1.0 users. You can continue to use the Channel Integration Framework app to configure channel providers for single session Dynamics 365 model-driven app.

### Where do I configure voice channel provider for multisession apps?

You can configure voice channel providers in [Customer Service admin center and app profile manager](../../app-profile-manager/app-profile-manager.md).

### My organization is using voice channel configured using Channel Integration Framework 2.0. Does the change impact my organization?

Yes. From your channel provider record, you'll not be able to see the following two grids:

- Select the Unified Interface Apps for the Channel
- Select the Roles for the Channel
	
### How do I choose the Unified Interface apps for the voice channel provider record?

You don't need to choose the Unified Interface apps. The telephony channel providers are associated with app profiles, which works in the context of the multisession apps such as Omnichannel for Customer Service and Customer Service workspace.
	
### How do I select roles for the voice channel provider record?

Telephony channel providers are associated with agent profiles, which in turn are assigned to users in your organization. You must assign the agent profiles to users who need access to the telephony channel provider. More information: [Assign users, templates, configure productivity pane, channels](../customer-service/create-agent-experience-profile.md#assign-users-templates-configure-productivity-pane-channels)

### Will my existing communication widget, built using Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 1.0 APIs, continue to work with the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0 app?

Yes. Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 1.0 APIs will continue to be available and supported for the single-session Unified Interface apps like Customer Service Hub and Sales Hub. Even with the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0 app, they will continue to work.

### How do I use the multisession experiences for my contact center with a third-party provider's communication widget?

Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0 works only with multisession apps such as Omnichannel for Customer Service and Customer Service workspace. You can integrate any third-party telephony provider with Omnichannel for Customer Service or Customer Service workspace using the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0 APIs. 

For information on selecting versions, see [Choose between versions 1.0 and 2.0](choose-between-versions.md).

For information on license, see [Dynamics 365 Customer Service pricing overview](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/customer-service/overview/#pricing) and [Dynamics 365 Customer Service pricing plan](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/customer-service/#plans).

### My organization uses multiple channel providers. How can I start a default session? Also, why is the widget not visible in the home session?

If there are multiple channel providers in your organization, the widget won't be visible in the home session, as the home session isn't associated with any provider. Note that the [setMode](reference/microsoft-ciframework/setmode.md) API is not supported in the home page. So, in such a scenario, you must create a default session to show a dialer experience in the communication widget, conversation dashboards in the application tab, and so on. 

To create a default session, see [Start a home (default) session when your organization uses multiple channel providers](v2/support-multiple-providers.md#start-a-home-default-session-when-your-organization-uses-multiple-channel-providers).

### How can third-party telephony providers start their default session?

You can use the [Microsoft.CIFramework.setMode(1)](reference/microsoft-ciframework/setmode.md) method in your provider code to make the panel visible. More information: [Start a home (default) session when your organization uses a third-party telephony provider](v2/support-multiple-providers.md#start-a-home-default-session-when-your-organization-uses-a-single-channel-provider)

### Why is the user presence not loading or user is shown as unknown? 

User presence might not load if the agent doesn't have the Omnichannel agent role privileges, if agent capacity and default presence are not set, or if the required channels aren't activated in the agent profile. More information: [User presence isnâ€™t loading or user is shown as unknown](../troubleshoot-omnichannel-customer-service.md#user-presence-isnt-loading-or-user-is-shown-as-unknown)

### Why should I check or update channel URLs in Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0?

When you deploy or update the Customer Service workspace app profile, the Channel URL field in the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0 settings for omnichannel gets overwritten. So after a deployment, the Channel Integration Framework product might point to a different URL. So, check and ensure that the Channel URL field in Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0 always points to the correct URL. More information: [Configure a third-party channel provider](v2/configure-channel-provider-app-profile-manager.md#configure-a-third-party-channel-provider)

### Why do tabs reload when an agent switches session tabs or switches from session tab to widget?

This is to make sure that the updated data is available for the agent at all times.

### Is it possible to integrate custom messaging channel providers?

Yes, you can integrate custom messaging channels using Direct Line bot. More information: [Integrate your own custom channel: Direct Line](../../customer-service/bring-your-own-channel.md)

### Is it possible to view the existing channel providers from Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0 model-driven app?

No, you'll have to navigate to Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 2.0 from app profile manager to view your existing channel providers. More information: [Configure channel provider using app profile manager](v2/configure-channel-provider-app-profile-manager.md)


## Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 1.0

### What happens when you select a role from under Select roles for the Channel?

When you select a particular security role for the channel provider from under the **Select roles for the Channel** dropdown list, the security role provides certain access rights to the channel provider. If no role is selected, the channel provider can only be accessed by System Administrators and Customizers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select a role in the **Select roles for the Channel** list, it does not filter out users with just the System Administrator role. The System Administrator and Customizer roles will always have access to the channel provider. When you assign a System Administrator role to a user, the other users who have been assigned the System Administrator role earlier will not lose access unless you explicitly revoke system administrator rights from a user.

### Can I load the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework 1.0 communication widget in Omnichannel for Customer Service?

No, that is not supported.

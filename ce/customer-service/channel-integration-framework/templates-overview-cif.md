# Preview: Overview of templates

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - A preview is a feature that is not complete, as it may employ reduced privacy, security, and/or compliance commitments, but is made available before it is officially released for general availability so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Previews are provided “as-is,” “with all faults,” “as available,” and without warranty.​
> - This preview feature does not come with technical support and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won’t be able to help you with issues or questions.  If Microsoft does elect to provide any type of support, such support is provided "as is," "with all faults," and without warranty, and may be discontinued at any time.​
> - Previews are not meant for production use, especially to process Personal Data or other data that is subject to heightened compliance requirements, and any use of "live" or production data is at your sole risk.  All previews are subject to separate [Terms and Conditions](../../legal/dynamics-insider-agreement.md).

When you (an agent) get an incoming conversation request, Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework version 2.0 allows channel providers to search and open records on an incoming call. However, your organization might have different requirements and want to use different custom entities and correlate to a conversation.

Also, the **Omnichannel for Customer Service app** allows you to open third-party web applications in the application tabs. Your organization might have different line-of-business applications, and while starting a session, you might want to load the line-of-business applications for a specific conversation type.

To choose the applications you want to open for every session, according to your organization requirements, session templates are introduced:

- [Session templates](session-templates-cif.md)
- [Application tab templates](application-tab-templates-cif.md)
- [Notification templates](notification-templates-cif.md)

> [!WARNING]
> It is recommended that you don’t edit the out-of-the-box sample templates in the package because it affects the functionality.

# Channel Analytics

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Channel Integration Framework provides insights about how the call center is performing in terms of agent assignments, customer satisfaction, average handling time and agent performance. It uses predictive algorithms to calculate upcoming load, customer satisfaction, relationship scores and upsell probability, and helps you utilize operational and conversational analytics for better future planning. 

The two APIs for tracking event analytics are:

- [initLogAnalytics](reference/microsoft-ciframework/initLogAnalytics.md)

- [logAnalyticsEvent](reference/microsoft-ciframework/logAnalyticsEvent.md)

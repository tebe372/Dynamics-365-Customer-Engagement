# Search for knowledge articles in the Customer Service Hub
 Knowledge base search in the Customer Service Hub app lets you search for relevant knowledge articles to resolve a case. To search for knowledge articles in a case form, select the **Knowledge Base Search** search box in the **Knowledge Base Search control** of the **Related** section.

The search results are automatically populated based on a field your administrator configured in the **Knowledge Base Search** control properties. Out of the box, for a case this is the title of the case record.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Knowledge base search in the Customer Service Hub shows relevant knowledge articles only when your organization is set up to use the native [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] knowledge management capability. For more information, talk to your administrator.

For more information, see [Knowledge Base Search control](#knowledge-base-search-control).

## Knowledge base search control powered by Relevance search 

Knowledge base search in the Customer Service Hub now comes with an improved search functionality. The knowledge base search is now enabled to use Relevance search mechanism in the knowledge base search control area, in addition to the global search area where the Relevance search mechanism was already enabled.

[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [How Relevance Search works](../admin/configure-relevance-search-organization.md#how-relevance-search-works)

Relevance search mechanism uses Azure search service to index and search records.  Relevance search provides improved search functionality like better relevance, highlighted search keyword text, and search within attachments and notes. With Relevance search, you can also configure searchable fields in the knowledge article entity. 

[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Configure searchable fields for Relevance Search](../admin/configure-relevance-search-organization.md#configure-searchable-fields-for-relevance-search)


> [!NOTE]
> To enable Relevance search for knowledge article entity, see [Enable Relevance Search](../admin/configure-relevance-search-organization.md#enable-relevance-search) and [Select entities for Relevance Search](../admin/configure-relevance-search-organization.md#select-entities-for-relevance-search).</br>
If Relevance search is not enabled for the entity, standard Full-text search is used. 

For more information, see [Understand knowledge base search mechanisms](knowledge-base-search-methods.md).


### Before you begin using Relevance search

Relevance search uses the scoring concepts as defined by Azure search. To be able to search the knowledge base using Relevance search, certain view columns should be mandatorily configured in the Quick Find view columns list. If any of these columns are deleted or missing, the search query displays an error.

> [!NOTE]
> An admin can configure the knowledge article quick find view columns list by navigating to **Settings > Customizations > Entities > Knowledge Article > Views > Quick Find View > View Columns**.

Here are the required view columns:

- Article Public Number
- Title 
- Created On 
- Keywords
- Knowledge Article Views 
- Language
- Major Version Number 
- Minor Version Number 
- Rating
- Status
- Modified On

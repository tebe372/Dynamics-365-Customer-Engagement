# Search for knowledge articles in the Customer Service Hub
 Knowledge base search in the Customer Service Hub app lets you search for relevant knowledge articles to resolve a case. To search for knowledge articles in a case form, select the **Knowledge Base Search** search box in the **Knowledge Base Search control** of the **Related** section.

The search results are automatically populated based on a field your administrator configured in the **Knowledge Base Search** control properties. Out of the box, for a case this is the title of the case record.

For more information, see [Knowledge Base Search control](#knowledge-base-search-control).

## Knowledge base search control powered by Relevance search 

Knowledge base search in the Customer Service Hub now comes with an improved search functionality. The knowledge base search is now enabled to use Relevance search mechanism in the knowledge base search control area, in addition to the global search area where the Relevance search mechanism was already enabled.

[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [How Relevance Search works](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization)

Relevance search mechanism uses Azure search service to index and search records.  Relevance search provides improved search functionality like better relevance, highlighted search keyword text, and search within attachments and notes. With Relevance search, you can also configure searchable fields in the knowledge article entity. 

[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Configure searchable fields for Relevance Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization)


> [!NOTE]
> To enable Relevance search for knowledge article entity, see [Enable Relevance Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization) and [Select entities for Relevance Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization).</br>
If Relevance search is not enabled for the entity, standard Full-text search is used. 

For more information, see [Understand knowledge base search mechanisms](knowledge-base-search-methods.md).


### Before you begin using Relevance search

Relevance search uses the scoring concepts as defined by Azure search. To be able to search the knowledge base using Relevance search, certain view columns should be mandatorily configured in the Quick Find view columns list. If any of these columns are deleted or missing, the search query displays an error.

> [!NOTE]
> An admin can configure the knowledge article quick find view columns list by navigating to **Settings > Customizations > Entities > Knowledge Article > Views > Quick Find View > View Columns**.

Here are the required view columns:

- Article Public Number
- Title 
- Created On 
- Keywords
- Knowledge Article Views 
- Language
- Major Version Number 
- Minor Version Number 
- Rating
- Status
- Modified On

## Knowledge Base Search control

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Customer Service Hub comes with an enhanced Knowledge Base Search that shows you the articles arranged in a single stream. Searching, sorting, and filtering the articles in the search control will be faster and more responsive with improvements to article viewability and usability.

### Filter knowledge articles

With the help of text and visual filters, you can filter the knowledge articles. To see knowledge articles in specific states, use the **Status** filter. You can filter search results to see all draft, published, or approved articles. See articles that are categorized as internal and external. You can also filter the articles based on date and language.

> - Copy Link, Email Link, and Email options can be used only for published and expired articles.

## View auto filtered results

As a customer service agent, to view the most relevant results, you can have knowledge articles automatically filtered based on the case data. This helps in identifying the most relevant articles so that you can resolve customer queries quickly and accurately. You can further have an option to disable the auto-filter results and search the entire knowledge base.  

Administrator or system customizer must configure this option for you. To learn more, see [Configure automatic filtering](add-knowledge-base-search-control-forms.md#configure-automatic-filtering). 

To view the auto filtered results:

1. Search knowledge articles from the case related section. To learn more, see [Search for knowledge articles in the Customer Service Hub](#search-for-knowledge-articles-in-the-customer-service-hub).

2. The articles are automatically filtered and displayed to you based on case data.

3. If you want to disable automatic filtering option and search the entire knowledge base for articles, deselect the **Auto-filter results** option.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > Administrator or system customizer must enable **Users can turn off automatic filtering** option for you to see the **Auto-filter results** option. If the **Users can turn off automatic filtering** option is not enabled, you will always see the auto filtered results. To learn more, see  [Configure automatic filtering](add-knowledge-base-search-control-forms.md#configure-automatic-filtering). 

Letâ€™s understand this in detail with the help of an example.

In the below illustration, the case subject is **Xbox**. If automatic filtering is configured on case subject, with the **Auto filter results** check box selected, only those knowledge articles whose subject is **Xbox** are automatically filtered in and displayed. Other articles are automatically filtered out. This is shown in the below image.

![Select Auto filter results](media/ka-select-auto-filter-results.png "Select Auto filter results")   
  
However, if the Auto filter results check box is not selected, you can see more articles that are not related to subject. These are the results from the entire knowledge base.

![Deselect Auto filter results](media/ka-deselect-auto-filter-results.png "Deselect Auto filter results")
    
## Submit ratings and feedback for knowledge articles

As a customer service agent, you can easily provide feedback on knowledge articles with the help of knowledge article rating in the Customer Service Hub. Knowledge article rating lets you provide feedback on knowledge articles within the context of case resolution. Knowledge managers can capture and review the feedback on the articles to improve and maintain a healthy knowledge base.

When you are working on a case and refer to an article from the **Knowledge Base Search** control, you will be presented with an option to rate whether the article is helpful and provides relevant information to assist customers quickly. If you think itâ€™s not helpful, you can rate the article accordingly and provide comments on how it can be improved

> [!NOTE]
> - Ensure that the knowledge article entity is enabled for feedback. To learn more, see [Enable an entity for feedback/ratings](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/enable-entity-feedback).
> - Customer service agents and customer service managers can create, or view feedbacks based on their role and privileges on feedback entity. Out of the box, customer service agents can create, view, or edit their own feedback only. Customer service managers or knowledge managers can view feedback submitted by all agents.

1. Open an article from search results to read it.

2. You can rate a knowledge article and submit feedback. 

    You can provide your feedback on the article, whether it is helpful or not, by selecting the **Thumbs up** or **Thumbs down** button.    

    ![Provide feedback](media/ka-rating-feedback-thubms-up-down.png "Provide feedback")

    If the article is not helpful, you can also provide your comments in the comment box on how the article can be improved. The comment box is displayed when you select **Thumbs down** button.

    ![Provide comments](media/ka-rating-feedback-provide-comments.png "Provide comments")

To set up the feedback control, see [Enable feedback control](set-up-knowledge-management-embedded-knowledge-search.md#enable-feedback-control).

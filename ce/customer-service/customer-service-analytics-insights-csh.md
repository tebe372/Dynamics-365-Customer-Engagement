The Insights dashboards for Customer Service contain a variety of charts and metrics to help you to understand the factors that have the greatest impact on customer service for your organization. Key performance indicators and visual breakdowns of your organization's support cases are coupled with AI-generated insights on cases, agents, and topics that contribute to overall trends.

Customer Service dashboards give you a performance summary in addition to detailed reports on agents and topics.  

Right-clicking on a chart entry and hovering over **Drill through**, selecting **Agent Details** or **Topic details** brings up a more detailed report that's specific to the selected agent or topic.

Navigate to the Knowledge Search analytics tab to view key details about what search terms agents and smart agent assist are using to find knowledge articles related to cases. For more information, see [Knowledge search analytics dashboard](knowledge-search-analytics-cs.md).

## Information you need to know about Customer Service analytics reports

### Reports refresh, data retention

The following information is applicable to reports refresh:

- **Data refresh:** Occurs every 24 hours. The reports are available during the refresh process. You might see a warning icon beside the **Last refresh (UTC)** label in the upper-right corner of each report when there's a delay or issue in the data refresh. When you hover over the icon, the tooltip message indicates whether the dataset is up to date.

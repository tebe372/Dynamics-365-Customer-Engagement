# Create and manage operating hours

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

Operating hours define the hours when your organization's customer support team is active and available to serve customers. By setting up operating hours, you help your customers and your organization work together to resolve issues.

The operating hours schedules cater to the following scenarios:

- Display the non-availability of customer support on public holidays that are otherwise operating hours.
- Accommodate change of calendar timings for daylight saving time twice an year for timezones that have implemented the daylight saving time.
- Set up separate schedules for agents, bots, and queues to cater to different business scenarios and product lines seamlessly for any channel.
- Define schedules to transition customer queues from bots to agents.
- Customize the display and other settings of the chat widget during non-business hours.

After you define the business hours for your organization and set up [Automated messages](configure-automated-message.md) to be displayed to customers, when customers interact through a channel during non-business hours, they will see the messages that you have set. For example, customers can be shown an offline message on the chat widget as "Our agents are not available. Our business hours are between 8:00 am to 5:00 pm." Similarly, for social channels, you can configure the operating hours at the queue level. When customers contact your agents through any of the social channels outside the business hours, they will receive responses that you have set.

After you create an operating hour record, in Omnichannel admin center, you can do the following steps, depending on your requirement:

- **Queues:** Configure the operating hour on the main page of the queue.
- **Chat widget:** Add the operating hour record on the **Chat widget** tab.
- **SMS channels:** Add the operating hour record on the **Behaviors** tab of the channel instance that can be accessed through the corresponding workstream.

In Omnichannel Administration, you can add the operating hour record on the **Design** tab of the appropriate chat widget to control the display of the widget. For SMS channels and queues, the operating hour will be available for selection on the **General** and **Summary** tabs respectively.

## Create a record to define operating hours

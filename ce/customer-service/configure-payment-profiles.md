# Configure payment profiles

You can create payment profiles to enable conversational commerce for supported channels. Once configured, your agents can help customers complete secure transactions without having to leave the messaging experience.

After you create a payment profile record, you must add it to a channel instance within a workstream's channel setup to make it work. Conversational commerce is supported for Apple Messages for Business.

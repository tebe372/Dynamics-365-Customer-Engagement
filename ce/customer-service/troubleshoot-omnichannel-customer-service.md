# Troubleshoot Omnichannel for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Use the following list of troubleshooting topics to quickly find information to solve your issue.

## The instance is not available to select on the provisioning application

### Issue

For security, reliability, and performance reasons, Omnichannel is separated by geographical locations known as regions. The provisioning web page only displays instances in the same region, so you might experience issues that you don’t see all the instances from the Organization selector if you have instances in more than one region and provision Omnichannel without selecting the correct region.

### Resolution

Perform the following:

From the admin portal, select the desired region from the drop-down menu. 

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Region drop-down menu screenshot](media/oc-region-menu.png "Region drop-down menu")

Changing the region causes the portal to reload. When it has finished reloading, proceed to **Applications** > **Omnichannel for Customer Service**, and then proceed with the usual provisioning steps.

The provisioning application you are directed to is associated with the region you chose, and all instances located in that region are displayed as options for provisioning.

## Omnichannel provisioning fails due to expired Teams Service Principal

### Issue

If your tenant has an expired Microsoft 365 license, then the provisioning of Omnichannel for Customer Service fails in your organization.

### Resolution

To avoid the provisioning failure, you must remove the Teams Service Principal and Skype Teams Calling API Service in Azure Active Directory. Follow the steps to remove the services.

[Step 1: Identify the services in Azure Active Directory](#step-1-identify-the-services-in-azure-active-directory)

[Step 2: Use PowerShell to remove Microsoft Teams and Skype Teams Calling API Service](#step-2-use-powershell-to-remove-microsoft-teams-and-skype-teams-calling-api-service)

#### Step 1: Identify the services in Azure Active Directory

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **Azure Active Directory** in the left pane.
3. Select **Enterprise Applications**.
4. In the search criteria, select **All Applications** and **Disabled** in **Application Type** and **Application Status**.
5. In the search box, enter the application ID `cc15fd57-2c6c-4117-a88c-83b1d56b4bbe` for Microsoft Teams.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Microsoft Teams object and app IDs](media/teams-object-appid.png "Microsoft Teams object and app IDs")

6. In the result that appears, copy the **Object ID**, and save it. Ensure that the application ID is  `cc15fd57-2c6c-4117-a88c-83b1d56b4bbe` as this ID is same for every tenant.

7. Now, search for Skype Teams Calling API Service by entering its application ID `26a18ebc-cdf7-4a6a-91cb-beb352805e81` in the search box.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Skype object and app IDs](media/skype-object-appid.png "Skype object and app IDs")

8. In the result that appears, copy the **Object ID**. Make sure that the application ID is `26a18ebc-cdf7-4a6a-91cb-beb352805e81`.

#### Step 2: Use PowerShell to remove Microsoft Teams and Skype Teams Calling API Service

1. Select **Start**, type **PowerShell**, and right-click **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator**.  <br>
![Run PowerShell as an administrator](media/powershell.png "Run PowerShell as an administrator")

2. Select **Yes** on the **User Control** dialog to allow the application to make changes.
3. Type the `Install-Module AzureAD` command in the Powershell window, and press **Enter**. This command installs the PowerShell commands for interacting with Azure Active Directory. <br>
![Execute command](media/powershell2.png "Execute command")

4. PowerShell prompts whether to trust the repository. Type **Y** for yes and press **Enter**.  <br>
![Run command](media/powershell3.png "Run command")

5. Type the `Connect-AzureAD` command in the PowerShell window, and press **Enter**.
This establishes a connection with the tenant's Azure Active Directory, so you can manage it using Powershell.
6. Sign in to your organization as a tenant admin.
7. Run the `Remove-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectID <ObjectID>` command in the PowerShell window twice, one each for Microsoft Teams and Skype Teams Calling API Service. Replace **<ObjectID>** with the object ID you had stored earlier. This command deletes the expired Teams service and Skype Teams Calling API Service from Azure Active Directory.

   > [!Note]
   > Right click in the PowerShell window to paste the Object ID.

The Microsoft Teams Service and Skype Teams Calling API Service are removed from your organization. You can try to provision Omnichannel for Customer Service again.

## Errors occur when I try to open Omnichannel for Customer Service or Customer Service workspace with Omnichannel enabled

### Issue

As an agent, when you log in to the Omnichannel for Customer Service application or when you log in on Customer Service Workspace with Omnichannel enabled, you see error messages.

### Resolution

When you open the Omnichannel for Customer Service application or Customer Service workspace with Omnichannel enabled, the system performs a variety of tasks including logging in to Omnichannel, preparing for notifications, and setting your presence. If the system encounters any errors while performing these operations, they are displayed on the user interface.  

If you get any of the errors listed in the table below, work with your administrator to ensure you have the right security roles, Omnichannel capacity, and default presence set. When the administrator makes changes to these settings, the changes may take up to 15 minutes to reflect. As an agent, you should log out, clear your browser cache, and close and reopen the browser to try again. If the issue persists, work with your administrator to create a service request with details including the organization URL, agent ID, error message, and client session ID value.

### Error messages 

  - Something went wrong while authenticating—please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

  - We couldn't get your authentication token—please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

  - We couldn't set up notifications—please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

  - We couldn't set up presences—please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

  - Something went wrong while setting up your workspace—please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

  - We couldn't set up presences due to missing roles — Ask your administrator to grant you Omnichannel roles. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID. To learn more about security roles, see [Assign roles and enable users for Omnichannel for Customer Service](administrator/add-users-assign-roles.md). 

  - We couldn't get your authentication token — Your Teams subscription has expired, please contact your admin to renew it. If this continues, have your admin contact Microsoft Support with the Client Session ID:{0}. To resolve the issue, follow the steps in [Omnichannel provisioning fails due to expired Teams Service Principal](#omnichannel-provisioning-fails-due-to-expired-teams-service-principal).

## Error occurs when I try to create a chat widget or social channel

### Issue

Omnichannel solutions are installed in your environment when you receive a new trial organization. However, when you try to create a chat widget, Facebook page, or social channel in the Omnichannel Administration app, error messages similar to the following might be displayed:

- An error occurred in the PreLiveChatConfigCreatePlugin plug-in.
- An error occurred in the PostOperationFacebookCreatePlugin plug-in.

### Resolution

These errors occur because though the solutions are already installed in your environment, they need to be activated before you can start using them. To provision the solutions, perform the steps outlined in [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](administrator/omnichannel-provision-license.md).

## Entity routing configuration fails

### Issue 1

One of issues is that **Entity Records Distribution Flow** connection is not authorized. Due to this issue, you can see a business process error.

**Unable to complete the operation due to an error. Try again later. If the issue persists, contact Microsoft support.**

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Business process error due to unauthorized connection](media/business-process-error1.PNG "Business process error due to unauthorized connection")

### Resolution

Go to Entity Records Distribution Flow and authenticate the connection.

To resolve the issue, perform steps 1 through 9 in the [Update entity records work distribution flow](administrator/multiple-ws-entity-record-routing.md#step-2-update-entity-records-distribution-flow) topic.

### Issue 2

**Entity Records Distribution Flow** is not updated automatically. Due to this issue, you can't create an entity records channel and the system shows a business process error.

**The operation failed due to an incorrect configuration in Entity Records Distribution Flow. Ensure the Entity Records Distribution Flow isn't deleted or renamed.**

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Business process error due to incorrect configuration for Entity Records Distribution Flow](media/business-process-error2.PNG "Entity Records Distribution Flow business process error")

In Power Automate, you might see either **Cases Work Distribution Flow** or **Entity Records Distribution Flow**.

### Resolution

To workaround the issue, you need to reset the Flow. To reset the Flow, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the Omnichannel Administration app.

2. Select **Entity Records** under **Channels**.

3. Select the **New** to create a new entity record channel.

4. Select **Flow** menu in the command bar, and then select **See your flows**. Power Automate opens in a new browser window.

5. Select **Solutions** in the sitemap, and then select **Default Solution** from the list.

6. Select **New**. and then select **Flow**. A new **Flow** is displayed.

8. Select **New step**. The **Choose an action** flow component is added.

9. Type **Common Data Service (current environment)** in the search box, and then select the option. The flow component is added.

10. Select **Perform an unbound action** from the **Actions** tab. The action is added in the component.

11. Type **msdyn_ResetWorkDistributionFlow** in the **Action Name** field.

    > [!Note]
    > Don't change the **ShouldMaintainCustomizations** value from **No**.

12. Select **Save**.

13. Select back arrow button in the Flow page.

    > [!Note]
    > Do not select browser window back button.

14. Select **Run** from the command bar. The **Run flow** pane is displayed.

15. Select **Run Flow** and then select **Done**. You can see the flow will run and succeeds.

After you reset the flow, go to Omnichannel Administration, where you saw the error message. Select **OK**, and then save the record. The entity record channel is saved.

Even though the Flow is reset, it doesn't update the name if it is **Case Work Distribution Flow**.

To rename the Flow, select **Edit**, type the name of the flow as **Entity Record Distribution Flow** in the **Flow name** field, and select **Save**.

### Issue 3

There may be an issue with customizations in the **Entity Records Distribution Flow**.

### Resolution

Go to **Entity Records Distribution Flow** and review your customization made to the flow. 

Review and resolve the error that is due to your customizations. For more information, see [Update entity records work distribution flow](administrator/multiple-ws-entity-record-routing.md#update-entity-records-work-distribution-flow).

## Power Virtual Agents bot conversations appear as active on dashboard even after customer has ended chat<a name="pvaendconv"></a>

### Issue

Conversations for Power Virtual Agents bot cannot be ended in Omnichannel for Customer Service and therefore will be seen as active on the supervisor dashboard even after they have been closed.

### Resolution

You can configure a context variable that will explicitly end the bot conversation in Omnichannel for Customer Service after customers close the chat window. In Power Virtual Agents, create a standalone topic for CloseOmnichannelConversation context variable with the variable property set to global. Invoke the topic in another topic that you've configured for the bot.

Though the conversation will be closed in Omnichannel for Customer Service, it will not be closed in Power Virtual Agents and appear in the **Escalation rate drivers** KPI in **Power Virtual Agents Analytics** dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you have access to Power Automate to configure a flow so that the bot conversation in Omnichannel for Customer Service can be ended.

To configure ending a bot conversation, perform the following steps:

1. In Power Virtual Agents, for the selected bot, configure a new topic.
2. Select **Go to authoring canvas**, and in **Add node**, select **Call an action**, and then select **Create a flow**.
3. On the Power Automate window that opens on a new tab, do the following:
   1. In the **Return value(s) to Power Virtual Agents** box, select **Add an input**, and then select **Yes/No**.
   2. In the **Enter title** box, enter CloseOmnichannelConversation, which is the Omnichannel for Customer Service context variable name.
   3. In the **Enter a value to respond** box, select the **Expression** tab, and then enter **bool(true)** to build the expression, and select **OK**.
   4. Save the changes, and then exit Power Automate.
4. In the topic that you were editing, select **Call an action** again, and then in the list, select the flow that you created. 
5.  In **Add node**, select **End the conversation**, and then select **Transfer to agent**.
        > ![Configure end-conversation topic](media/end-bot-conversation.png "Configure end-conversation topic")
6. Go to the topic in which you need to invoke the topic for ending the bot conversation in Omnichannel for Customer Service, and use the **Go to another topic** option in **Add a node**.
7. Select the topic that you created for ending the bot conversation.
8. Save and publish the changes.

Additionally, you can configure automated messages in Omnichannel for Customer Service that will be displayed to the customer after the conversation ends.

### Resolution

You must delete the existing sample solutions before importing the Omnichannel for Customer Service - Unified Service Desk package. The pre-imported sample solutions are as follows:

- USDISHCustomization or USDWebClientCustomization (one of these solutions would be present depending on the org template)
- USDUnifiedInterfaceCustomization
- DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk
- UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM

After you delete the solutions, import the Unified Service Desk - Omnichannel for Customer Service package.

To delete the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Dynamics 365 instance.
2. Choose **Settings** > **Solutions** on the nav bar.
3. Select one of the solutions on the **Solutions** page by selecting the check box, and then choose **Delete**. You are prompted to confirm uninstalling a managed solution. Choose **OK** to proceed. <br>
   - USDISHCustomization or USDWebClientCustomization (one of these solutions would be present depending on the org template)
   - USDUnifiedInterfaceCustomization
   - DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk
   - UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM
      > [!NOTE]
      > You must the delete the solutions in the following order:
      > 1. USDISHCustomization or USDWebClientCustomization
      > 2. USDUnifiedInterfaceCustomization
      > 3. DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk
      > 4. UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM2011
      > 
      >  You must follow the order to remove the solutions because some of the components in the solution depend on the components in the other solution.
4. After the solution is removed, repeat the steps to delete the other solutions.

# Troubleshoot issues in Omnichannel for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Use the following list of troubleshooting topics to quickly find information to solve your issue.

## The instance isn't available to select on the provisioning application <a name="provision"></a>

### Issue

For security, reliability, and performance reasons, Omnichannel for Customer Service is separated by geographical locations known as "regions". The provisioning webpage only displays instances in the same region, so you might experience issues where you don’t see all the instances from the Organization selector if you have instances in more than one region, and you provision Omnichannel for Customer Service without selecting the correct region.

### Resolution

Go to the Power Platform admin center (https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). Expand Resources, and select Dynamics 365. Select the region in the upper-right corner and select a new region from the dropdown list.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Power Platform admin center change region.](media/oc-region-menu.png "Power Platform admin center change region")

The portal will reload when you change the region. After it has finished reloading, go to **Applications** > **Omnichannel for Customer Service**, and then do the provisioning steps.

The provisioning application you are directed to is associated with the region you chose, and all instances located in that region are displayed as options for provisioning.

## Omnichannel provisioning fails due to expired Teams service principal

### Issue

If your tenant has an expired Microsoft 365 license, then the provisioning of Omnichannel for Customer Service will fail in your organization.

### Resolution

To avoid the provisioning failure, you must remove the Microsoft Teams service principal and Skype Teams Calling API Service in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and add it back. Follow the steps to remove the services.

1. Identify the services in Azure AD.

2. Use PowerShell to remove Microsoft Teams and Skype Teams Calling API Service.
3. Add the service principal back.


#### Identify the services in Azure AD

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **Azure Active Directory** in the left pane.
3. Select **Enterprise Applications**.
4. In the search criteria, select **All Applications** and **Disabled** in **Application Type** and **Application Status**.
5. In the search box, enter the application ID `cc15fd57-2c6c-4117-a88c-83b1d56b4bbe` for Microsoft Teams.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Microsoft Teams object and app IDs.](media/teams-object-appid.png "Microsoft Teams object and app IDs")

6. In the result that appears, copy the **Object ID**, and save it. Ensure that the application ID is  `cc15fd57-2c6c-4117-a88c-83b1d56b4bbe` as this ID is same for every tenant.

7. Now, search for Skype Teams Calling API Service by entering its application ID `26a18ebc-cdf7-4a6a-91cb-beb352805e81` in the search box.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Skype object and app IDs.](media/skype-object-appid.png "Skype object and app IDs")

8. In the result that appears, copy the **Object ID**. Make sure that the application ID is `26a18ebc-cdf7-4a6a-91cb-beb352805e81`.

#### Use PowerShell to remove Microsoft Teams and Skype Teams Calling API Service

1. Select **Start**, type **PowerShell**, and right-click **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator**.  <br>
![Run PowerShell as an administrator.](media/powershell.png "Run PowerShell as an administrator")

2. Select **Yes** on the **User Control** dialog to allow the application to make changes.
3. Type the `Install-Module AzureAD` command in the PowerShell window, and press **Enter**. This command installs the PowerShell commands for interacting with Azure Active Directory. <br>
![Execute command.](media/powershell2.png "Execute command")

4. PowerShell prompts whether to trust the repository. Type **Y** for yes and press **Enter**.  <br>
![Run command.](media/powershell3.png "Run command")

5. Type the `Connect-AzureAD` command in the PowerShell window, and press **Enter**.
This establishes a connection with the tenant's Azure Active Directory, so you can manage it using PowerShell.
6. Sign in to your organization as a tenant admin.
7. Run the `Remove-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectID <ObjectID>` command in the PowerShell window twice, one each for Microsoft Teams and Skype Teams Calling API Service. Replace **`<ObjectID>`** with the object ID you had stored earlier. This command deletes the expired Teams service and Skype Teams Calling API Service from Azure Active Directory.

   > [!Note]
   > Right click in the PowerShell window to paste the Object ID.

The Microsoft Teams Service and Skype Teams Calling API Service are removed from your organization. You can try to provision Omnichannel for Customer Service again.

#### Add the service principal for the Permission service app

After removing the expired Microsoft Teams license from the tenant, you can add the chat to the tenant again by doing the following:

1. Run the following commands in the PowerShell window:

   `Login-AzureRmAccount`

   `$appId="6d32b7f8-782e-43e0-ac47-aaad9f4eb839"`

   `$sp=Get-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ServicePrincipalName $appId`
   
   `if ($sp -eq $null) { New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $appId }`

   `Start-Process "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=$appId"`

2. In the browser window that appears, sign in to your organization as a tenant admin to grant the admin consent.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Ignore the error page that appears with the message "no reply URLs configured".

3. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as a tenant admin to enable Azure AD for user sign-in.

4. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise Applications**.

5. In the search box, enter **6d32b7f8-782e-43e0-ac47-aaad9f4eb839** for the application ID. The Permission Service O365 is listed.

6. Select the app, go to the **Properties** tab, and turn on the **Enabled for users to sign-in** toggle.

The chat is added to the tenant again.

## Errors occur when I try to open Omnichannel for Customer Service or Customer Service workspace with Omnichannel enabled <a name="oc-csw-errors"></a> 

### Issue

As an agent, when you log in to the Omnichannel for Customer Service application or when you log in on Customer Service Workspace with Omnichannel enabled, you see error messages.

### Resolution

When you open the Omnichannel for Customer Service application or Customer Service workspace with Omnichannel enabled, the system performs a variety of tasks including logging in to Omnichannel, preparing for notifications, and setting your presence. If the system encounters any errors while performing these operations, they are displayed on the user interface.

If you get any of the errors listed below, check if Security Defaults is turned on. If it is turned on, the agent should have the right authentication set up. Alternatively, Security Defaults can be switched off if it is not required.

To learn more about Security Defaults, see the topic [What are security defaults?](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults)



If your tenant is configured with Azure Security Defaults, make sure your users have multi-factor authentication set up on their accounts. Otherwise, they might run into a single sign-on error. To learn more about Azure Security defaults, see [What are security defaults ?](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults)


### Error messages 

  - There was a problem with your single sign-on account. Please sign out of all Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps and sign in again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with client session ID.

  - Something went wrong while authenticating—please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

  - We couldn't get your authentication token—please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

  - We couldn't set up notifications—please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

  - We couldn't set up presences—please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

  - Something went wrong while setting up your workspace—please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

  - We couldn't set up presences due to missing roles — Ask your administrator to grant you Omnichannel roles. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID. To learn more about security roles, see [Assign roles and enable users for Omnichannel for Customer Service](add-users-assign-roles.md). 

  - We couldn't get your authentication token — Your Teams subscription has expired, please contact your admin to renew it. If this continues, have your admin contact Microsoft Support with the Client Session ID:{0}. To resolve the issue, follow the steps in [Omnichannel provisioning fails due to expired Teams Service Principal](#omnichannel-provisioning-fails-due-to-expired-teams-service-principal).

## Error occurs when I try to create a chat widget or social channel <a name="chat-widget"></a>

### Issue

Omnichannel solutions are installed in your environment when you receive a new trial organization. However, when you try to create a chat widget, Facebook page, or social channel in the Omnichannel Administration app, error messages similar to the following might be displayed:

- An error occurred in the PreLiveChatConfigCreatePlugin plug-in.
- An error occurred in the PostOperationFacebookCreatePlugin plug-in.

### Resolution

These errors occur because though the solutions are already installed in your environment, they need to be activated before you can start using them. To provision the solutions, perform the steps outlined in [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](omnichannel-provision-license.md).

## Unable to deploy custom solution containing Agentscript solution

### Issue

When you try to deploy a custom solution, it fails on account of a dependency on the Agentscript solution, which is part of Omnichannel for Customer Service.

### Cause

The Agentscript solution has been deprecated and was not present in the target environment. It has been replaced by the msdyn_Agentscripts solution.

### Resolution

 We recommend that you remove all references of the Agentscript solution from the custom solution, and then reimport the solution.

## Power Virtual Agents bot conversations appear as active on dashboard even after customer has ended chat<a name="pvaendconv"></a>

### Issue

Conversations for Power Virtual Agents bot cannot be ended in Omnichannel for Customer Service and therefore will be seen as active on the supervisor dashboard even after they have been closed.

### Resolution 

You can configure a context variable that will explicitly end the bot conversation in Omnichannel for Customer Service after customers close the chat window. In Power Virtual Agents, create a standalone topic for CloseOmnichannelConversation context variable with the variable property set to global. Invoke the topic in another topic that you've configured for the bot.

Though the conversation will be closed in Omnichannel for Customer Service, it will not be closed in Power Virtual Agents and appear in the **Escalation rate drivers** KPI in **Power Virtual Agents Analytics** dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you have access to Power Automate to configure a flow so that the bot conversation in Omnichannel for Customer Service can be ended.

To configure ending a bot conversation, perform the following steps:

1. In Power Virtual Agents, for the selected bot, configure a new topic.
2. Select **Go to authoring canvas**, and in **Add node**, select **Call an action**, and then select **Create a flow**.
3. On the Power Automate window that opens on a new tab, do the following:
   1. In the **Return value(s) to Power Virtual Agents** box, select **Add an input**, and then select **Yes/No**.
   2. In the **Enter title** box, enter CloseOmnichannelConversation, which is the Omnichannel for Customer Service context variable name.
   3. In the **Enter a value to respond** box, select the **Expression** tab, and then enter **bool(true)** to build the expression, and select **OK**.
   4. Save the changes, and then exit Power Automate.
4. In the topic that you were editing, select **Call an action** again, and then in the list, select the flow that you created. 
5.  In **Add node**, select **End the conversation**, and then select **Transfer to agent**.
        > ![Configure end-conversation topic.](media/end-bot-conversation.png "Configure end-conversation topic")
6. Go to the topic in which you need to invoke the topic for ending the bot conversation in Omnichannel for Customer Service, and use the **Go to another topic** option in **Add a node**.
7. Select the topic that you created for ending the bot conversation.
8. Save and publish the changes.

Additionally, you can configure automated messages in Omnichannel for Customer Service that will be displayed to the customer after the conversation ends.

## Chat widget icon does not load on the portal

### Issue

    - Tier 1 Dashboard
    - Tier 2 Dashboard <br>
    ![Add dashboards in the app designer canvas area.](media/oceh-app-designer-add-dashboard.png "Add dashboards")
6. Select **Save** and then select **Publish**.

## Agent dashboard isn’t loading or is giving an authorization error

### Issue

The issue might happen due to the following reasons:

- Azure Active Directory consent is not available for Omnichannel for Customer Service app.
- Agent doesn't the Omnichannel agent role privileges.
- Agent is not assigned to any queue.

### Resolution

Perform the following:

- Contact your administrator to verify Azure Active Directory consent is given to the Omnichannel for Customer Service application on your tenant. Go to [Authorize access](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2070932) to get access. To learn more, see [Provide data access consent](omnichannel-provision-license.md#provide-data-access-consent).

## Pre-imported Unified Service Desk configurations in Customer Service organization

### Issue

Dynamics 365 Customer Service organization that you create from **demos.microsoft.com** have pre-imported sample Unified Service Desk configuration.

If you import the Unified Service Desk - Omnichannel for Customer Service package without deleting the existing configuration in the new demo org, you see an error after signing in to Unified Service Desk client application. The reason for the issue is multiple sample Unified Service Desk configurations cannot exist in a Customer Service instance.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![The hosted application couldn't be created.](media/usd-client-error.png "The hosted application couldn't be created")

### Resolution

You must delete the existing sample solutions before importing the Omnichannel for Customer Service - Unified Service Desk package. The pre-imported sample solutions are as follows:

- USDISHCustomization or USDWebClientCustomization (one of these solutions would be present depending on the org template)
- USDUnifiedInterfaceCustomization
- DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk
- UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM

After you delete the solutions, import the Unified Service Desk - Omnichannel for Customer Service package.

To delete the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Dynamics 365 instance.
2. Choose **Settings** > **Solutions** on the nav bar.
3. Select one of the solutions on the **Solutions** page by selecting the check box, and then choose **Delete**. You are prompted to confirm uninstalling a managed solution. Choose **OK** to proceed. <br>
   - USDISHCustomization or USDWebClientCustomization (one of these solutions would be present depending on the org template)
   - USDUnifiedInterfaceCustomization
   - DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk
   - UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM
      > [!NOTE]
      > You must delete the solutions in the following order:
      > 1. USDISHCustomization or USDWebClientCustomization
      > 2. USDUnifiedInterfaceCustomization
      > 3. DynamicsUnifiedServiceDesk
      > 4. UiiForMicrosoftDynamicsCRM2011
      > 
      >  You must follow the order to remove the solutions because some of the components in the solution depend on the components in the other solution.
4. After the solution is removed, repeat the steps to delete the other solutions.

## Unable to launch Unified Service Desk client application

### Issue

When you sign in to Unified Service Desk, you see the following error.

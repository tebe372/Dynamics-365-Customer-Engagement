# Routing rules for a workstream

A workstream is a container for work items to be enriched, routed, and assigned. A workstream is associated with a channel, such as live chat. Routing rules are written as rulesets, which comprise rule items. Routing rules for a workstream are composed of work classification rules and route-to-queue rules.

## Work classification rules

Work classification rules let you update work item attributes. Typically, rules are written in the format of "if defined condition satisfies, then set the output attributes to certain values," but can also be surfaced through machine learning models. They are optional and can be used to add additional information to the incoming work items that are then used for more precise routing and assignment.

Work classification rules can be written by using the manual declarative decision list or by using machine learning models.

### Manual classification rules

Manual classification rules are run to update work item attributes. They are written in the format of "if defined condition satisfies, then set the output attributes to certain values." You can create conditions to define rules based on multiple entity attributes. To create manual work classification rulesets, see [Manual work classification rulesets](configure-work-classification.md#create-manual-work-classification-rulesets).

#### Skill attachment rules

Skill attachment rules are a sub-type of manual work classification rules and are defined to attach skills to the work item. They are written in the format of "if defined condition satisfies, then attach defined skills to the work item."

### Machine learning model-based rules

Machine learning model-based rules are a sub-type of work classification rules, and are rules defined to attach skills to the work item using the AI Builder text classification machine learning model created as part of the intelligent skill finder bootstrapping experience. They are written in the format of "send work item selected attributes to the published model and attach the returned tags from the model as skills on the work item."

## Route-to-queues rules

Queue routing rules are rules to send the work item to the right queue. They are written in the format of, "If defined condition satisfies, then route the work item to the defined queue." They are optional, and if no rules are defined or no rules match, then the incoming work item will be routed to the default queue of the respective channel type. For a workstream, the route-to-queue ruleset is run after all of the work classification rulesets are run. A workstream can have only one route-to-queues ruleset.

### How prioritization ruleset works

A prioritization ruleset is an ordered list of prioritization rules. Every prioritization rule represents a priority bucket in the queue. In a prioritization rule you can specify a set of "conditions" and "order by" attributes. During evaluation, the prioritization rules will be run in the order they are listed. For the first prioritization rule, the work items in the queue that match its conditions will be put in the same "priority bucket". In that bucket, the items will be further sorted by the order specified in the prioritization rule. The second rule will run on the rest of the items in the queue to identify the next priority bucket, sort that bucket by the "order by" attribute, and so on.

### Author the assignment ruleset

After the prioritization ruleset, you can author the assignment rule set for the queue. The assignment rule set is an ordered list of assignment rules. Each assignment rule consists of a set of conditions using which agents are selected and an "order by" field using which the agents that match are sorted. During runtime, the assignment rule with the top order is evaluated first. The agents are matched as per the conditions specified in the rule. If more than one matching agents exist, then they are sorted by the "order by" field, and the top agent is assigned the work. If no agents are matched, then the next assignment rule in the rule set is evaluated, and so on. This can be thought of as gradual relaxation of constraints in the assignmentâ€”the strictest criteria is applied first, and then the conditions are slowly reduced so that the best agent is found.

# Configure Customer Service

Use the Customer Service Hub app to set up everything related to customer service, like defining parent-child case hierarchy, creating queues, routing rule sets, rules for automatic case creation, service-level agreements (SLAs), entitlements, and customer service schedules.

## Customer Service Hub

Use the Service Management to set up various admin tasks for customer service.

In the bottom left pane, select the change area, and select Service Management.

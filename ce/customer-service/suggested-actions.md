# Display suggested actions in a vertical layout

Your bot can use suggested actions to present buttons or options in the chat window, which the user can tap to provide input. This way, users can answer a question or make a selection without having to use a keyboard.

Suggested actions can be displayed vertically to enhance the user experience and promote easy readability. More information: [Customize a chat widget](customize-chat-widget.md)

The suggested actions feature is now supported in Microsoft Teams along with other asynchronous chat channels.

- You have a Power BI Pro license for all supervisors.
- Service Root URL of your Dynamics 365 instance.

## Step 2: Install Dynamics 365 Customer Service Analytics app

1. Sign in to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/) app as an administrator.
2. As a Power BI admin, open the link: [https://aka.ms/cs-analytics](https://aka.ms/cs-analytics)
3. Install the **Customer Service Analytics for Dynamics 365** app. The app configuration options page is displayed.

## Step 3: Connect Dynamics 365 organization to Customer Service Analytics app
 
 1. On the app configuration options page, select **Connect**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - connect data](media/cs-app-get-started.png "Customer Service app install - connect data")

2. On the **Connect to Customer Service Analytics for Dynamics 365** page, enter your organization's Dynamics 365 Service Root URL, and select **Next**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - root URL](media/cs-analytics-root-url.png "Customer Service app install - root URL")

3. (Optional) To find the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Data URL, follow these steps:

    a. Sign in to Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

    b. Go to **Settings** and then select **Developer Resources**.  

    c. Find the Data URL under **Service Root URL**. 

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - OData URL](media/cs-analytics-odata-url.png "Customer Service app install - OData URL")

4. On the page that appears, select **OAuth2** in **Authentication method**, and **Organizational** in **Privacy level setting for this data source**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install](media/cs-analytics-install.png "Customer Service app install")

5. Select **Sign in**. The sign-in page appears.
6. Enter your Dynamics 365 organization credentials, and select **Enter**. After you are signed in, the existing report is updated with the data from your organization.

## Step 4: Configure refresh frequency on Power BI dataset

After you connect the Dynamics 365 Customer Service Analytics app with a Dynamics 365 organization, you need to configure the refresh frequency on the Power BI dataset to update reports and dashboards properly.

1. Sign in to Power BI as an administrator.
2. Go to the **Dynamics 365 Customer Service Analytics** app workspace.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - refresh frequency](media/cs-analytics-refresh-frequency.png "Customer Service app install - refresh frequency")

3. Go to the **Datasets** tab and select **Settings**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - data settings](media/cs-analytics-data-settings.png "Customer Service app install - data settings")

4. Turn **Scheduled refresh** to **On**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - Scheduled refresh](media/cs-analytics-schedule-refresh.png "Customer Service app install - Scheduled refresh")

    Now, publish the application in your organization. 

 > [!NOTE]
 > We recommend you configure the refresh frequency to **Daily**. 

## Step 5: Publish application within your organization

You must share the configured application with your entire organization for supervisors to view **Customer Service Analytics** dashboards and reports with their own **Power BI Pro** accounts.

1. On the app workspace, select **Update app**.
  
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - Publish application](media/cs-analytics-publish-application.png "Customer Service app install - Publish application")

2. In the Update app wizard, go to the **Access** tab.

3. Choose **Entire organization** and select **Update app**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - application](media/cs-analytics-update-app.png "Customer Service app install - application")

    The app is now available to install for all individuals in your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Verify your administrator has allowed users in your organization to have read/write data permissions in Omnichannel Engagement Hub. To learn more, see [Provide data access consent](/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/omnichannel-provision-license#provide-data-access-consent).  

## Step 6: Enable Power BI reporting in the Common Data Service platform

As an administrator, you must enable Power BI reporting in the Common Data Service platform environment for supervisors to view the dashboards.

1. Sign in to the Common Data Service platform, and go to **Settings**.

2. Select **Administration** > **System Settings**.

3. Go to the **Reporting** tab and enable **Allow Power BI visualization embedding**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - enable Power BI](media/cs-analytics-enable-pbi.png "Customer Service app install - enable Power BI")

    Supervisors can now configure dashboards.

## Step 7: Add Power BI dashboards to Customer Service Hub

Each supervisor must configure their environment to integrate the Customer Service Analytics dashboard. 

1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 Customer Service and open the **Customer Service Hub** app.

2. Select **Dashboards** under **My Work**.

3. Select **New** > **Power BI Dashboard**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Power BI dashboard](media/cs-pbi-dashboard-menu.png "Power BI dashboard")

4. For **Workspace**, select **Customer Service Analytics for Dynamics 365**. For **Dashboard**, select **Customer Service Analytics for Dynamics 365**. 

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Power BI dashboard properties](media/cs-pbi-dashboard-properties.png "Power BI dashboard properties")

5. Save and close. 

   The Customer Service Analytics dashboard is now available in Dynamics 365.

## Add users to supervisor configuration

You must add users to the supervisor configuration to access any supervisor dashboard in Unified Service Desk. To add users in supervisor configuration, follow these steps: 
 
 1. Sign in to the Unified Service Desk Administrator app.

 2. Select **Configuration**.

 3. On the configuration page, select **Supervisor Configuration**. 

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Supervisor Configuration](media/cs-supervisor-configurations.PNG "Supervisor Configuration")

 4. On the **Users** section, select **+ Add Existing User**. The **Lookup Records** pane is displayed.

 6. Select **Save**.

    Users are now added to the supervisor dashboard. When they sign in to Omnichannel Engagement Hub on Unified Service Desk, the supervisor dashboard tabs will be available. 
 
## Customize Customer Service Analytics
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft does not support customizations made to the Power BI template app and does not provide updates once modifications are made. 

Power BI is a comprehensive collection of services and tools that you use to visualize your business data. Power BI Template apps make it easy to visualize and analyze the Customer Service Analytics data with Power BI based on a standard data model. The Customer Service Analytics template app is built with a set of entities and fields that are useful for most reporting scenarios. 

Dynamics 365 apps are often extended with custom fields. These custom fields don't automatically show up in the Power BI model. This topic describes how you can edit and extend the report included in the template app to include custom fields in the Power BI model. 

Before you customize the template app, read the information here and perform each task, as necessary. 

### Prerequisites

- [Power BI service registration](https://powerbi.com "Power BI service registration").

- [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/ "Power BI Desktop") application for editing Power BI reports. 

- Power BI report for the Customer Service template app that you want to customize.

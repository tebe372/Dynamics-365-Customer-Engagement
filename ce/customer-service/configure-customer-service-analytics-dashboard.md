### Step 1: Prerequisites 

Review the following prerequisites before configuring the supervisor dashboard: 

- You have administrative privileges for Dynamics 365 and Power BI. 
- You have a Power BI Pro license for all supervisors. 

### Step 2: Install Dynamics 365 Customer Service Analytics app 

1. Sign in to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/) app as an administrator. 
2. As a Power BI admin, browse to this link: [http://aka.ms/cs-insights](http://aka.ms/cs-insights)
3. Install **Dynamics 365 Customer Service Analytics** app. 
4. After **Dynamics 365 Customer Service Analytics** app is installed, the app configuration options page displays. 
    
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install](media/cs-service-app-install.png "Customer Service app install view") 
    
    Now proceed to configure the app by connecting your Dynamics 365 organization. 

### Step 3: Connect Dynamics 365 organization to Customer Service Analytics app
 
 1. On the **Dynamics 365 Customer Service Analytics** app configuration options page, select **Connect data**. 
    
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - connect data](media/cs-app-get-started.png "Customer Service app install connect data") 
    
2. On the connect data page, enter your organization's Dynamics 365 Service Root URL and select **Next**. 
    
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - root url](media/cs-analytics-root-url.png "Customer Service app install - root url") 

3. (Optional) To find the Microsoft Dynamics 365 OData URL, follow these steps: 

    a. Sign into Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement.

    b. Go to **Settings** and then select **Developer Resources**.  

    c. Find the OData URL under **Service Root URL**.

4. Select **Authentication method** as **OAuth2** and **Privacy level** as **Organizational**. Select **Sign in**.

    > ![Customer Service app install](media/cs-analytics-install.png "Customer Service app install") 
    
5. Enter your Dynamics 365 organization credentials and press **Enter**. 

    When you are successfully signed in, the existing report is updated with the data from your organization. 
    Now configure the refresh frequency for the reports and dashboards. 

### Step 4: Configure refresh frequency on Power BI Dataset 

After you connect Dynamics 365 Customer Service Analytics app with Dynamics 365 organization, you need to configure the refresh frequency on the Power BI dataset to update reports and dashboards properly.

1. Sign into Power BI app as administrator
2. Go to the **Dynamics 365 Customer Service Analytics** app **workspace**.
    
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - refresh frequency](media/cs-analytics-refresh-frequency.png "Customer Service app install - refresh frequency")
    
3. Go to the **Datasets** tab and select **Settings**.
     
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - data settings](media/cs-analytics-data-settings.png "Customer Service app install - data settings")

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install - Scheduled refresh](media/cs-analytics-schedule-refresh.png "Customer Service app install - Scheduled refresh")

    Now, publish the application in your organization. 

 > [!NOTE]
 > We recommend you configure the refresh frequency to **Daily**.

2. In the Update app wizard, go to the **Access** tab.

    Supervisors can now configure dashboards. 
 
### Step 7: Add Power BI Dashboards to Customer Service Hub 

Each supervisor must configure their Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement environment to integrate the Customer Service Analytics dashboard. 

1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement and open the **Customer Service Hub** app.
     
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Customer Service app install](media/cs-analytics-cs-hub.png "Customer Service app install")

2. Open **Supervisor Dashboards**.
     
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]

## Customize Customer Service Analytics 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft does not support customizations made to the Power BI template app and does not provide updates once modifications are made. 

Power BI is a comprehensive collection of services and tools that you use to visualize your business data. Power BI Template apps make it easy to visualize and analyze the Customer Service Analytics data with Power BI based on a standard data model. Customer Service Analytics template app is built with a set of entities and fields that useful for most reporting scenarios. 

Dynamics 365 apps are often extended with custom fields. These custom fields donâ€™t automatically show up in Power BI model. This topic describes how you can edit and extend the report included in the template app to include custom fields in the Power BI model. 

Before you customize the template app, read the information here and perform each task, as necessary.

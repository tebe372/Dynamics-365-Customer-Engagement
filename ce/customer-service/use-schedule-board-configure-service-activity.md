# Use the schedule board to configure service activity

Schedule Board in Service Scheduling lets you view resource availability before you can book them for service activities. Set up views and filters as per your preference and book service activities for each of your resources.

In the schedule board, you can do the following tasks and activities:  
  
- View your organization's daily, weekly, and monthly schedule of appointments and service activities.  
  
- View work schedules and service activity schedules for a variety of resources.  
  
- Create new appointments and schedule service activities.  
  
- Change the status of an existing service activity.  
  
- Search for conflicts in the schedule.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> You canâ€™t customize the schedule board or change the default view with the application. However, you can ask your system administrator to change the colors of the time blocks.

# Best practices for configuring bots

[!INCLUDE[cc-context-variable-considerations](../includes/cc-context-variable-considerations.md)]

When you configure Azure and Power Virtual Agents bots in Omnichannel for Customer Service, use the following best practices:

- In a queue, if both bots and human agents are available, set the bot’s capacity higher than all agents. A bot’s capacity isn't reduced even after a work item is assigned to it. This ensures that any conversation routed to the queue is first picked up by the bot.

- When a bot escalates a conversation to a human agent, make sure that the context variables being updated by the bot and the corresponding routing rules match correctly.

- When a conversation that's escalated by a bot comes back to the bot queue due to incorrect routing or context variables not being updated at runtime, the bot won't be assigned to the same conversation again. So, to prevent conversations from ending up in an infinite loop, you must configure a human agent for the bot queue.

- Unlike human agents, bots aren't added to a "default" queue at the outset; you must add them from the Omnichannel admin center or Customer Service admin center apps.  

- The message size must be less than or equal to 28 KB in all messaging channels. The size limit includes metadata like timestamps and tags. If you're a bot author or developer and want to pass complex cards or message types across channels, ensure that your message size doesn't exceed the limit. If you're integrating a custom channel via Direct Line, then make sure that the activity payload doesn't exceed the message size limit.

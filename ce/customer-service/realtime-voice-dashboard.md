The Voice report gives you insights into key metrics across the voice channel. You can filter these areas by time, queue, time zone, conversation status, or direction. More information: [Overview of Omnichannel Real-time analytics dashboards (preview)](intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md#overview-of-omnichannel-real-time-analytics-dashboards-preview)
You will see the Voice report, only if your organization has the Voice feature configured.

## Interactive charts

You can view different types of charts on the report, such as bar, horizontal bar, and donut chart. The visual display helps you see the changes and patterns in data, and act quickly to address the most important issues.

When you select a component on the chart, data gets filtered accordingly and you'll be able to view data related only to the selected component. For example, if you select the **Busy** piece in the **Agent availability status** chart, the dashboard will refresh and youâ€™ll see only the agents who are currently in the **Busy** state.

The Voice report displays the following charts.

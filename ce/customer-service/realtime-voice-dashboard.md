# View and understand the Voice report in Omnichannel real-time analytics

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The voice report gives you insights into key metrics across the voice channel. You can filter these areas by time, queue, time zone, conversation status, or direction. More information: [Overview of Omnichannel real-time analytics dashboards](intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md#overview-of-omnichannel-real-time-analytics-dashboards). 
You will see the voice report, only if your organization has the voice feature configured. More information: [Manage real-time analytics reports in Omnichannel for Customer Service](enable-realtime-analytics-dashboard-administrator.md#manage-real-time-analytics-reports-in-omnichannel-for-customer-service)

This report provides the summary of voice conversations over time by queue. Voice-specific metrics for the last 24 hours, such as conversation in queue, average wait time, average handle time, help you optimize the call flow. You can use these metrics to reduce the conversation hold time and increase agent efficiency as well as customer satisfaction.

You can also monitor other voice-specific metrics such as conversation direction, that indicates whether the conversation was started by the customer or a contact center agent. You can use these operational metrics to manage queue distribution.

For details on metrics displayed in the Voice report charts, go to [Use Omnichannel for Customer Service metrics](oc-metrics-dimensions.md#use-omnichannel-for-customer-service-metrics).

## Interactive charts

You can view different types of charts on the report, such as bar, horizontal bar, and donut chart. The visual display helps you see the changes and patterns in data and act quickly to address the most important issues.

When you select a component on the chart, data gets filtered accordingly and you'll be able to view data related only to the selected component. For example, if you select the **Busy** piece in the **Agent availability status** chart, the dashboard will refresh and youâ€™ll see only the agents who are currently in the **Busy** state.

## Drill-down report

Drill down to sections within a report to find the data that interests you the most. You can view voice conversation analytics, when you select the **Show more** link on the **Voice conversations over time** KPI. You can drill through voice conversations analytics and analyze data by Queue.

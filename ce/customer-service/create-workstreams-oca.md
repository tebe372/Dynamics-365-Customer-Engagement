# Create workstreams in Omnichannel Administration

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Support for the Omnichannel Administration app ended on April 30, 2022. We recommend that you use the Omnichannel admin center or Customer Service admin center app to configure and use the latest features, such as unified routing and voice channel. For more information about the deprecation announcement, see Omnichannel Administration app is deprecated.
> - Additionally, workstreams that you create in the Omnichannel Administration app can't be modified in the Omnichannel admin center app. You'll need to migrate the existing workstreams and then manage them in the Omnichannel admin center app. More information: [Migrate workstreams created in Omnichannel Administration](migrate-workstreams.md)

## Introduction

A workstream is a collection of routing rules. Routing settings define how conversations should be routed to queues. Work distribution settings define how conversations should be allocated to agents within a queue. You can create the workstreams in the Omnichannel admin center, Customer Service Hub, and Omnichannel Administration apps.

A workstream can belong to multiple channels of the same type, like multiple chat channels. In this case, all the conversations from these channels inherit the routing and work distribution settings of the workstream they belong to.

If you want to create workstreams to configure unified routing, see [Create workstreams in Omnichannel admin center](create-workstreams.md).

Perform the following steps:

1. In the Omnichannel Administration site map, go to **Work Distribution Management** > **Work Streams**.

    The **Active Work Streams** view is displayed.

    > ![Omnichannel workstreams.](media/oc-workstream-view.png "Omnichannel workstreams")

2. On the command bar, select **New** to create a work stream.

3. In the **Work Distribution** tab of the new work stream, follow these steps:

   1. In the **General information** section, specify the following information: </br>
      - **Name**: Enter a name for the workstream.
      - **Channel**: Channel is defined as a medium through which a customer reaches out for support. For example, a customer can contact an agent through chat.

        Select a channel from the dropdown list:
        - Live chat
        - SMS
        - Facebook
        - Entity Records
        - WeChat
        - Microsoft Teams
        - LINE
        - WhatsApp
        - Custom
        - Twitter

      - **Capacity**: Specify the units of capacity that are required to process a single conversation for the workstream in the text box. For information on how to determine capacity units, see [Capacity](users-user-profiles.md#capacity).

      - **Auto-close after inactivity**: Enter the unit of time after which a conversation is moved from **Waiting** to **Closed** state because of inactivity.
      
   2. Select **Save**. The workstream is saved.

   3. In the **Work distribution settings** section, perform the following steps:

      1. Select whether the **Work distribution mode** should be **Push** or **Pick** for agents to take up a conversation.      
      1. In **Allowed Presences**, select a base presence, such as **Available** and **Busy**, from the dropdown. You can select all options also. Agents will be allocated work items if the agent presence is set to one of the statuses specified here. If you have enabled [missed notifications](manage-missed-notifications.md), do not select **Away** as an allowed presence. For information, see [Configure and manage custom presence](presence-custom-presence.md).
      1. If you have selected **Push** in **Work distribution mode**, set the toggle to **Yes** for **Enable selecting from push-based work streams**. The agents can assign work items to themselves irrespective of constraints, such as capacity and presence.
      1. If you want an ongoing conversation to be assigned to the same agent when the conversation status changes from waiting to active, make sure the **Enable Agent Affinity** is set to yes. By default, the toggle is enabled for SMS and social channels.
      
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Enable Agent Affinity** option is available only when the work distribution mode is push. More information: [Agent affinity](create-workstreams.md#agent-affinity)

4. View and create context variables in the **Context variables** tab. Context variables enrich conversations with pre-chat data, channel data, and custom context data. These attributes can then be used to define routing rules to route conversations to different queues.

   1. Select **New** to create a context variable in the **Quick Create** window.
   2. Enter **Display Name** for the new variable. The **Name** field is populated accordingly.
   3. Select the **Type** of variable from the drop-down list. You can choose from **Text** or **Number**.

      > ![New context variable.](media/context-variable.png "New context variable")

5. Define routing rule items in the **Routing rule items** tab. Routing rule items are configured for each work stream, so that conversations can be routed to the correct queues. To learn how to configure a routing rule, see [Create and manage routing rules in Omnichannel](routing-rules.md).

6. Select **Save**. The workstream is saved.

## Associate workstreams with channel artifacts

You can associate work streams with channel artifacts so that the conversations can be assigned to agents seamlessly. For example, for a live chat widget, a default workstream is already associated in the **Work stream** field. You can select the search icon to associate another workstream. Select **New** to create a new workstream from within the live chat widget.

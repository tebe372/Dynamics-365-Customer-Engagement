# Troubleshoot issues in Customer Service and Omnichannel for Customer Service using Solution Health Hub

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

You can use Solution Health Hub to get a better picture of the state of your Dynamics 365 environment and detect any issues it might have. Solution Health Hub runs rules within an instance to validate the environment's configuration, which might change over time through natural system operations. The rules are specific to Customer Service and Omnichannel for Customer Service; you can run the rules on demand when you run into an issue. Some rules are automatically triggered when Customer Service or Omnichannel for Customer Service is installed or updated. You can regularly run the rule sets to monitor the health of your environment.

Some of the issues that the Solution Health Hub helps detect are as follows:

- **Customer Service**
  - Critical Customer Service processes are deactivated
  - Processes that will cause an upgrade to fail are assigned to disabled users
  - Presence of customized web resources that might lead to runtime issues

- **Omnichannel for Customer Service**
  - Missed or wrong configurations
  - Queues with no agents
  - Agents with no capacity
  - Agents who aren't part of any queues
  - Work stream configuration problems

## Prerequisites

To run the rules for Customer Service, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The Customer Service Hub app installed in your environment.
- You should have either the CSR Manager or System Administrator security role

To run the rule for Omnichannel for Customer Service, you must have Omnichannel for Customer Service installed in your environment.

## Run a health check

Perform the following steps to run an analysis job to check for issues in Omnichannel for Customer Service:

1. Open Solution Health Hub app.
2. Select **Analysis Jobs** > **New**.
3. In the **Create Analysis Job** dialog box, in  **Rule Set**, select **Omnichannel** or **Customer Service**, and then select **OK**.

## Analyze the health check results

 After the analysis job completes its run, the results are displayed on the **Job Details** tab.

The following information is available:

- **Name:** The name of the analysis job.
- **Status:** The status of the run.
- **Start Time:** The date and time when the job was started.
- **End Time:** The date and time when the job completed its run.
- **Failed Rules:** The number of rules that failed.
- **Warnings:** The number of rules that resulted in warnings.
- **Passed Rules:** The number of rules that passed successfully.
- **Total Rules** The number of available rules.
- **Rule Run Count:** The count of rules that have been run.

The details of the results are displayed in a table as follows:

- **Name:** The name of the rule.
- **Message:** A brief summary of the result.
- **Return Status:** Whether the rule passed, failed, or returned a warning.
- **Severity:** The severity level.

You can do the following:

1. Select a rule for which the status appears as failed. The results of the analysis of the objects that failed are displayed in the **Failing Records** area.
    > ![Analysis job results for a rule](./media/oc-solution-health-results.png "Analysis job results for a rule")
2. Optionally, select the **Summary** tab for an overview of the results.

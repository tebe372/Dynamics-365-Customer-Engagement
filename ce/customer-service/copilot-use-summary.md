# Use Copilot to summarize cases and conversations 

You can use Copilot to summarize cases and conversations if your administrator has turned on this feature. 

## Summarize cases

Copilot case summaries help you to quickly understand the context of a case and resolve customer issues more efficiently. The case summary includes key information such as the case title, customer, subject, product, priority, case type, and description.

### Get a case summary

The case summary appears as a card on the case form. When you open a case, the case summary card is collapsed by default so that that your screen isn't cluttered with information. Select the card to expand the summary.

You can copy the summary, refresh it, and provide feedback.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also generate a case summary for cases that are resolved or cancelled.

## Summarize conversations

Copilot conversation summaries provide context and relay the steps that you've already taken to solve the issue. You can summarize chat and transcribed voice conversations.

> [!NOTE]
> If your administrator has turned on auto-summarization for ongoing conversations, you get an AI-generated summary of the conversation along with the Copilot-generated conversation summary. The two summaries may be slightly different. [Learn more about auto-summarized conversations](cs-ai-generated-summary.md).

### Get a conversation summary

Depending on the triggers your administrator has set up, the Copilot conversation summary is generated like this:

- Automatically when you request a consultation with another agent, transfer the conversation, or end the conversation.
- When you select **Summarize conversation** in an ongoing conversation.

You can also take the following actions:

- Copy the summary.
- Select **Create case** to create a case and populate the description with the summary, if your administrator has turned on this feature.
- Share feedback about the summary.
- Close the summary card.

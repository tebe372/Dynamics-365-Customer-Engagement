# Enable consult pane for agents

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

To improve agent productivity, the consult option in the communication panel is now a separate pane. With the consult pane, the agents can conveniently consult another agent or supervisor without getting their messages mixed up with those meant for their customers. When the consult option is turned off, a separate pane will not open when agents select the consult option. Instead, the consulted messages will be flagged as internal and will appear in the communication panel.

## Enable consult pane

When agents use the consult option during their interaction with a customer, the **Consult** pane will appear beside the communication panel. The public and internal modes are not available when consult pane setting is enabled.

Do the following to enable the consult pane for agents:

1. In Omnichannel admin center, under **Advanced settings**, select **Agent experience**.
2. On the **Agent experience** page, under **Agent productivity**, select the **Manage** option for **Consult (preview)**.
3. On the **Omnichannel configuration** page, on the **Consult** tab, set the toggle to **Yes** for **Enable new consult experience**.
4. Save and close the page.

# Bring your own carrier

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

[Azure direct routing (preview)](/azure/communication-services/concepts/telephony-sms/telephony-concept#azure-direct-routing) enables you to connect your existing telephony infrastructure with Azure so that you can retain your existing carrier and phone numbers, and streamline inter-office call transfers.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be met:

- Connect to an Azure Communication Services resource to bring in your carrier via Azure direct routing. You must then set up Azure direct routing for the connected Azure resource.

- Familiarity with the following features:

  - [Understand Azure Communication Services](/azure/communication-services/overview)
  - [Understand Azure direct routing](/azure/communication-services/concepts/telephony-sms/telephony-concept#azure-direct-routing)

- Also, ensure that the following settings are in place to enable your carrier to work with Azure Communication Services:

  - [Azure direct routing infrastructure](/azure/communication-services/concepts/telephony-sms/direct-routing-infrastructure)
  - [Get a certified Session Border Controller (SBC)](/azure/communication-services/concepts/telephony-sms/certified-session-border-controllers)
  - [Connect the SBC to Azure Communication Services](/azure/communication-services/concepts/telephony-sms/direct-routing-provisioning)

## Bring your own phone number via Azure direct routing

1. In Dynamics 365, go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.

1. In the **Add your own phone number** dialog, enter the following details:

    - **Phone number**: Indicates the phone number that you own and have configured in your SBC.

    - **Carrier**: Indicates the carrier to which the phone number belongs. If the carrier doesnâ€™t exist yet, you can create a new record.

    - **Country/Region**: Select the country or region the phone number belongs to.

    - **Number type**: Select whether toll-free or a local phone number.

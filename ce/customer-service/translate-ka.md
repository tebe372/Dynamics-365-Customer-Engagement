# Select a language for your knowledge article translation

Your knowledge article must reach your customers irrespective of their market or region. The knowledge management capability in Dynamics 365 Customer Service helps you set the translation language for your articles, which enables you to provide the same self-help content in multiple languages, without having to manage multiple copies of the same article.  
  
1. Open the article you want to translate, and from the command bar, select **Translate**.  
  
2. In the **Create new translation** dialog, do the following:
   * From the **Pick a language** dropdown list, search for and select the language you want.  
   * In the **Create new version** field, select either **Major** or **Minor** version for your translation.  

    You can set languages that are supported by your Dynamics 365 instance.
  
4. Select **Create**.  
  
5. Enter your translated text in the appropriate fields. You can enter translated text for the following fields:  
  
   -   Title  
   -   Keywords  
   -   Article Description  
   -   Content  
  
6. When you are done reviewing and your article is ready for publish, select **More** > **Publish**. Select how and when you want to publish your new version. You can publish your new version immediately, schedule the publish for a future date, or leave it as a draft to publish it manually at a later point in time. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Schedule or publish an article](#schedule-or-publish-an-article)
  
## Manage article translations  

After you have published a translation for an article, you can manage it and any other translations by selecting the **Summary** tab of the knowledge article.  
  
1.  In the **Related Information** section, select **Related Translations**.  
  
2.  Open the translation you want to view. Keep in mind that there may be multiple versions for each language. You can sort the translations by selecting the column headers of the **Related Translations** section.  
  
     From here, you can:  
  
    -   Edit or update a translation.  
    -   Create a new major or minor version of a translation.  
    -   Delete a translation or version of a translation.

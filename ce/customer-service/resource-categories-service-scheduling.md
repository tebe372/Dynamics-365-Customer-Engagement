# Create and manage resource categories 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Using bookable resource categories you can group your bookable resources by type. For example, you can create categories like technician, supervisor, subcontractor, vehicle, or equipment.

## Create a new bookable resource category

Make sure that you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions.

1. In the Customer Service Hub sitemap, go to **Service Scheduling**.
2. From the list of entity records, select **Scheduling > Resource Category**.
   - The **Active Resource Categories** view is displayed. You can switch between various system views using the drop-down.
   - Select **Show Chart** in the command bar to see the chart view.
   - Select any existing resource category to see additional options in the command bar
3. On the command bar, select **New** to create a new bookable resource category. 
4. In the **General** section:
 
   - Enter a **Name** and a **Description** for the resource category

5. Select **Save**. A new resource category is created and is activated by default. 

6. In the **Related** section, you can view and manage various resource category associations.

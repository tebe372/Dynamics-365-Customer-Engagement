# View, add, and remove skills

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Dynamics 365 comes with an out-of-the box skill control for messaging channels. Your administrator can enable the setting that allows you to update skills at runtime.

When you receive a work item in your queue, you can view the skills required to do the work in the **Skills** field of your case record. 

You can view skills manually added by your administrator and skills identified by the machine-learning models, as shown in the following illustration.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Add skills.](media/skill-control.png "Add skills.")

If upon assessing the work item, you think that the relevant skills are incorrect or missing, you can choose to remove or add skills as appropriate.

To add skills, select **Add skill**, enter one or more skills, and select the plus (**+**) symbol.

To remove skills, select **X**.

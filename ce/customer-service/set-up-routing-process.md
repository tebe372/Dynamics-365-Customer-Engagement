# How to set up unified routing

## Introduction

You can set up unified routing in Customer Service Hub or Omnichannel admin center.

Typically, you'll use Customer Service Hub to set up routing of records, such as case.

You'll use Omnichannel admin center to route work items that come through different channels, such as live chat or Microsoft Teams.

In this article, we'll take you through the high-level process of configuring unified routing in both the apps.

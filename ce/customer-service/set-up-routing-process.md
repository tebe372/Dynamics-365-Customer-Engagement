# How to set up unified routing for a channel

## Prerequisites

For this process, you'll need the Omnichannel admin center app.

- To configure record routing, set the entity routing toggle to yes.
- To use skill-based routing, skills must be configured.
- To use machine learning work classification, the skill model must be configured.
- To use capacity-based classification, the capacity profile must be configured.

## How to set up unified routing

The high-level process to set up unified routing for a channel or record is as follows:



<!-- If these actions within creating workstreams and creating queues need to be done in order, they should be numbered. The multilevel bullets are hard to follow. --> 


1. Create workstreams.
   - Create a workstream for messaging.
     - Configure routing rules.
       - Configure manual work classification rulesets.
         - Create demand rules.
       - Configure machine-learning work classification rulesets. 
         - Set up input and output attributes.
       - Configure route-to-queues ruleset.
   - Create a workstream for record routing.
     - Configure intake rules.
     - Configure routing rules.
       - Configure work classification.
       - Configure route-to-queues ruleset.
2. Create queues.
   - Assignment methods.
     - Highest capacity.
     - Round robin.
     - Custom assignment method.
      - Configure prioritization ruleset.
        - Decision list of rules.
      - Assignment rulesets.

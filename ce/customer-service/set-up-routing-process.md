# Set up unified routing

## Prerequisites

Unified routing can be configured in the Omnichannel admin center or Customer Service Hub app only.

- To configure record routing, set the entity routing toggle to yes.
- To use skill-based routing, skills must be configured.
- To use machine learning work classification, the skill model must be configured and published.
- To use capacity-based classification, the capacity profile must be configured.

## How to set up unified routing

The high-level process to set up unified routing for a channel or record is as follows:

### For routing of messaging channels

You'll do the following:

- Create a messaging workstream
- Configure routing rules
  - Configure manual work classification rulesets
    - Create demand rules
  - Configure machine-learning work classification rulesets
    - Configure route-to-queues ruleset

### For record routing

You'll do the following:

- Create a record workstream
   1. Configure routing rules
      - Configure work classification rulesets
      - Configure route-to-queues ruleset
   2. Configure intake rules

### Create queues for record or messaging

- Create “record” or "messaging" queues
  - Choose assignment method
     - **Out-of-the-box:** Highest capacity or Round robin
     - Custom assignment method
        1. Configure prioritization ruleset
        2. Assignment rulesets
           1. Decision list of rules.
           2. Selection criteria

# Create and manage categories

Using the **Categories** entity, you can create hierarchical categorical data to help group records. Categorizing entity records in Dynamics 365 Customer Service helps you tag the records so that you can easily search them. Use the entity to create and manage a logical structure of categories in Dynamics 365 Customer Service, and then associate entity records to one or more categories.

Categories are useful for reporting, sorting, segmenting, and categorization of records. 

> [!NOTE]
> With the latest release of Dynamics 365 Customer Service app, categories in service management are available in the Customer Service Hub. We recommend that you create and manage categories using the new experience.

## Create a category

Follow the procedure given below to create a category:

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_custsvcmgr_sysadmin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-custsvcmgr-sysadmin-and-customizer.md)]  

    #### Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. In the Customer Service Hub sitemap, go to **Service Management** and select **Knowledge Base Management** > **Categories**.

    > [!NOTE]

3. To create a new category, select **New**.

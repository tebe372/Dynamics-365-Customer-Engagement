# Configure routing to preferred agents (preview)


To provide highly personalized services to your customers and address their pain points efficiently, you can configure the option to route work items to specific agents of your choice.


## Enable settings for routing to preferred agent

1. In Customer Service admin center, select **Routing** in the site map, and then select **Manage** for **Preferred agent routing (preview)** on the page that appears.

1. Turn on the **Enable preferred agent routing** toggle.

1. Select one of the following additional settings to determine the action when preferred agent is unavailable:

   - **Next best agent based on assignment logic**: The work item will be routed based on the assignment rules.

   - **No one. Let the work remain unassigned in the queue**: The work item will remain in the queue till the preferred agent picks it or it's manually routed to another agent.

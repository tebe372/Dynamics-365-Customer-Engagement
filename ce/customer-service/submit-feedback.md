# Submit ratings and feedback for knowledge articles

You can easily provide feedback on knowledge articles with the help of knowledge article rating. Knowledge article rating lets you provide feedback on knowledge articles within the context of case resolution. Knowledge managers can capture and review the feedback on the articles to improve and maintain a healthy knowledge base.

When you are working on a case and refer to an article from the **Knowledge** tab, you'll be presented with an option to rate whether the article is helpful and provides relevant information to assist customers quickly. If you think itâ€™s not helpful, you can rate the article accordingly and provide comments on how it can be improved.

> [!NOTE]
> - Ensure that the knowledge article entity is enabled for feedback. To learn more, see [Enable an entity for feedback/ratings](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/enable-entity-feedback).
> - Customer service agents and customer service managers can create, or view feedbacks based on their role and privileges on feedback entity. Out of the box, customer service agents can create, view, or edit their own feedback only. Customer service managers or knowledge managers can view feedback submitted by all agents.

1. Open an article from search results to read it.

2. You can rate a knowledge article and submit feedback. 

    You can provide your feedback on the article, whether it is helpful or not, by selecting the **Thumbs up** or **Thumbs down** button.

# Schedule a service activity (Customer Service app)

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Use this form to search for an available time for a service activity. You can either search for an open time using search criteria that, at a minimum, includes selecting a service, or you can define a more complex set of criteria. You can also create a service activity without checking for conflicts in the scheduled service. The service activity appears as a color block on the service calendar  
 
> [!NOTE]
> With the Customer Engagement apps version 9.1 release, the new Service Scheduling is now available in the Customer Service Hub sitemap. We recommend that you create service activities using the new experience. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Schedule a service activity](schedule-service-activity-csh.md)

You can’t create a recurring service activity and it is recommended to create individual service activities as per requirement. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> when you select resources manually and the system is unable to find a correct selection rule for the selected resources, you see the following error: </br> Can’t determine the correct selection rule for one or more selected resources. </br> In that case, you can: </br> - Either reselect the resources from the selection rule, OR </br> - Ignore the error and select Save. </br> If you choose to save, 1 unit of capacity is depleted for the unresolved resources.

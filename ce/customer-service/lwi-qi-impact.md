# How unified routing impacts queue items and the corresponding APIs

When you change the status of a queue item that has been routed using unified routing, the queue item is impacted in the following ways:

- When you change the queue of a particular queue item from, 
    - a basic queue to an advanced queue
    - or, from one advanced queue to another <br>
  by selecting  **Add to Queue** on the record (via the [AddToQueue Action](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/addtoqueue?view=dynamics-ce-odata-9)) or by selecting **Route To** on the queue item (via the [**RouteTo Action**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/routeto?view=dynamics-ce-odata-9)), the associated queue for the live work item ([msdyn_ocliveworkitem](/dynamics365/customer-service/developer/reference/entities/msdyn_ocliveworkitem)) also gets updated to the same destination queue. This action then updates the unified routing services that maintain agent presence and capacity with the corresponding changes.
- When you update the **Worked By** field of queue items by selecting **Route To** on the queue items list (via the **RouteTo Action**), the live work item (msdyn_ocliveworkitem) also gets assigned to the same agent.
- When you update a queue item using unified routing, you cannot remove it from the queue by selecting **Pick** ([**PickFromQueue Action**](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/pickfromqueue?view=dynamics-ce-odata-9)) or **RouteTo Action** on the queue item.
- When you deactivate a queue item that's part of an advanced queue, you cannot activate it again.
- When you delete a queue item by selecting **Remove** (via the [**RemoveFromQueue Action**](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/removefromqueue?view=dynamics-ce-odata-9)) or by deleting or canceling the underlying record, the associated live work item (msdyn_ocliveworkitem) is also closed. This action then updates the unified routing services that maintain agent presence and capacity with the corresponding changes.

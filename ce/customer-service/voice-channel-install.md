# Install the voice channel

To configure and use the voice channel for your business needs, you need to install the channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

## Prerequisite

You must obtain an active subscription of **Dynamics 365 Customer Service Voice Channel Add-in** or **Dynamics 365 Customer Service Digital Messaging and Voice Add-in**. For more information about licenses and pricing, see the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544). You can also purchase add-ins on the [Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/commerce/buy-or-edit-an-add-on?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

## Install the voice channel

1. Perform the steps outlined in [Set up Omnichannel for Customer Service](omnichannel-provision-license.md#set-up-omnichannel).

1. In the **Voice** section, set the **Add voice** toggle to **Yes** to enable the voice channel. Ensure that you select the **Voice and SMS Terms** checkbox.

1. Save and close.

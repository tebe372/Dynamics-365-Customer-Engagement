# View and understand the Agents insights report in Omnichannel intraday insights

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

The Omnichannel intraday insights dashboard contains the Agents insights report that helps provide an overview of agent performance.

## The Agents insights report

The **Agents insights** report consists of metrics from an agentâ€™s standpoint. The report shows all-up agent metrics across all channels or channel-wise agent performance. Supervisors can select the **All** tab to view agent performance across all channels, or select the **Live chat**, **Digital messaging**, or **Voice** tabs to view the agent performance for the corresponding channel.

The Digital messaging report includes metrics from the social channels, SMS, Microsoft Teams, entity records, and custom messaging channels.

You can view specific insights about the performance of individual agents or groups of agents, such as their availability, average length of time in conversations, and average response time per session.

You can also hover over an agent's name and a pop-up window will appear, showing details such as the agent's presence, current conversations, and the sentiments of those conversations, as well as an agent's available capacity across different capacity profiles. Unit-based capacity is accounted against Unit capacity profile.

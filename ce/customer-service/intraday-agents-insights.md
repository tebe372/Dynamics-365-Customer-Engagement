# View and understand the Agents insights report in Omnichannel intraday insights

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

The Omnichannel intraday insights dashboard contains the Agents insights report that helps provide an overview of agent performance.

## The Agents insights report

The **Agents insights** report consists of metrics from an agentâ€™s standpoint. The report shows all-up agent metrics across all channels or channel-wise agent performance. Supervisors can select the **All** tab to view agent performance across all channels, or select the **Live chat**, **Digital messaging**, or **Voice (preview)** tabs to view the agent performance for the corresponding channel. Digital messaging includes all asynchronous channels, like Facebook messenger, Twitter, WeChat, and SMS. The **Duration** option displays report details based on duration and time filter that is applied. The filter can be customized to show report data within the last four, eight, and twelve hours duration.

You can view specific insights about the performance of individual agents or groups of agents, such as their availability, average length of time in conversations, and average response time per session.

### Service scheduling powered by Universal Resource Scheduling 
Service scheduling, now built atop Universal Resource Scheduling (URS), provides an efficient way to schedule resources for service activity. It considers the availability of employees, facilities, and equipments to plan schedules accordingly. It also helps to improve service quality by preventing over-scheduling.

To learn more about the new scheduling in Customer Service, see [Service scheduling overview](basics-service-service-scheduling.md).

Have some questions? See the [Service Scheduling FAQ](service-scheduling-faq.md).

### Relevance search enabled for knowledge management 

Knowledge base search control in Customer Service is now powered by Relevance search to deliver results with improved performance and accuracy. With this feature, agents can search and choose the most relevant articles quickly with the help of highlighted search term matches in the results list. 

To learn more about how knowledge base search control works with Relevance search, see [Search for knowledge articles](search-knowledge-articles-csh.md).

To learn more about Relevance search, see [Use Relevance Search for faster, comprehensive search results](../basics/relevance-search-results.md).

### Enhanced customer service admin settings using Service Management

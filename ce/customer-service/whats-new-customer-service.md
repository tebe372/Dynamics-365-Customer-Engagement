# What's new in Dynamics 365 for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Welcome to Customer Service for Dynamics 365! Visit this page to see whatâ€™s added or updated recently.

## Dynamics 365 for Customer Service, October'18 release

The October'18 release of Dynamics 365 for Customer Service ensures holistic customer engagement across various touchpoints. It also facilitates improved operational efficiency and organizational productivity. 

Here are the new features introduced in the release:

### Service scheduling powered by Universal Resource Scheduling  

Service scheduling, now built atop Universal Resource Scheduling (URS), provides an efficient way to schedule resources for service activity. It considers the availability of employees, facilities, and equipment to plan schedules accordingly. It also helps in improved service quality by preventing over-scheduling.

To know more about the new service scheduling, see [Service scheduling overview](basics-service-service-scheduling.md).

To understand how to migrate from the web client version of service scheduling, refer [Migrate to the new service scheduling based on Universal Resource Scheduling (URS)](migrate-urs-service-scheduling.md).

### Relevance search enabled for knowledge management 

Knowledge base search control in Customer Service is now powered by relevance search to deliver results with improved performance and accuracy. With this feature, agents can search and choose the most relevant articles quickly with the help of highlighted search term matches in the results list. 

To know more about how the Knowledge base search control works with relevance search, see [Search for knowledge articles](customer-service-hub-user-guide-case-sla.md#search-for-knowledge-articles).

To understand relevance search better, refer [Use Relevance Search for faster, comprehensive search results](../basics/relevance-search-results.md).

### Enhanced customer service admin settings using Service Management

With the October'18 release, Service Management moves under the Customer Service Hub, enabling customer service managers to access and manage the configurations from inside the application. Built on the Unified Interface, the new Service Management helps to easily configure service tasks, enabling increased productivity.

Refer the [Service Manager Guide (Customer Service Hub and Customer Service app)](service-manager-guide.md) to understand more about customer service admin settings.

> [!NOTE]
> With the October'18 release, you can access and manage all admin settings from the Customer Service Hub sitemap except the following: **Routing Rule sets**, **Automatic Record Creation**, and **Service Level Agreements**. To access and manage these admin settings, use **Service Management** under **Settings** in the web application.

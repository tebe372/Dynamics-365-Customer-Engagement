# Manage phone music

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Omnichannel for Customer Services comes with out-of-the-box music files that you can use to set hold tunes and wait tunes. You can replace them with your own ones, or even upload new ones to be used for hold or wait music for your customer calls.

You can also configure hold and wait music for each language in each workstream.

## Edit music files

   - **Name**: Edit the name of the music file.

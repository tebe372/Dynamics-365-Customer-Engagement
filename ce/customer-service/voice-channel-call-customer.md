# Call a customer

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

To be able to call customers, your administrator must configure outbound calling, add you as user to the outbound capacity profile, and then set up outbound profiles. More information: [Outbound calling](voice-channel-outbound-calling.md)

1. In Customer Service workspace or Omnichannel for Customer Service, go to **Contacts**, and then select a customer to call.
2. On the **Active Conversation** page, locate the **Mobile Phone** field, and then select the call icon to call the customer. You can also select the **Launch dialer** phone icon on the menu bar to quickly call a customer.
     The **Dial number** panel appears. You can perform the following actions:
     - On the dial pad, you can copy or type in a number or select a number from the recently called numbers. The country code dropdown displays the list of supported countries and regions that you can call. You can also view and call from the most recently dialed called numbers. By default, the last 20 calls that youâ€™ve received or made are displayed.
     - In the profile dropdown, the outbound profile and the phone number that you're using to make the call is displayed. This is the outbound calling number that is displayed on the customer's phone when they receive your call.
     - You can call those phone numbers only whose regions are configured in the outbound profiles.
     - When you enter a phone number and you have multiple outbound profiles set, based on the country code, the application displays the profile of the region corresponding to the dialed code.
     - By default, the number pad is hidden. To display the number pad, select the number pad icon. 
3. Select **Call**. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you aren't assigned an outbound profile, you won't be able to make a call.

When the call connects, you see the customer details on the conversation page. Based on your outbound calling profile, the transcription and recording starts. If your capacity profile has a limit of one outbound call at a time, you can't make another call when a call is in progress.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need more trial minutes or phone numbers, we recommend that you file a request with Microsoft Support.

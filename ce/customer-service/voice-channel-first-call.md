# Make and receive your first phone call

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

When you want to try the voice channel for the first time in your org, the system sets it up for you to have the first-run experience. The tasks in this section take you through the automatic setup steps.


## Set up voice demo

1. In the **Omnichannel admin center** app, go to the Home page.

    ![Omnichannel admin center home page.](media/image9.png "Omnichannel admin center home page.")

1. On the **Try out live chat and voice calls** page, select **Set up voice demo**. You're directed to the setup page. The demo set up is automatic; however, you can watch the progress on the **We're setting up your voice demo** page.

    > [!Note]
    > If someone in your org has already tried the first run experience, you'll see **Try voice** instead of **Set up voice demo**.


1.  After the demo is set up, the **Try out voice** page displays the option to **Open voice demo** and the settings that have been configured.


## Try out voice

1. On the **Try out voice** page, select **Open voice demo**.

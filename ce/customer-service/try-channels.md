# Try channels in Omnichannel for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

Channels, for example, Live Chat and SMS, are the engagement channels that enable your agents to connect with customers in real time and provide quick personalized help.

You can perform the following steps to try channels in Omnichannel for Customer Service:

1. Sign up for a free 30-day trial of channels through Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service.


## Channels trial through Microsoft 365 admin center

The Dynamics 365 Customer Service Digital Messaging Add-on Trial is a free 30-day trial of Chat, SMS, and social channels that you can download from the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### Prerequisites for trial through Microsoft 365 admin center

You must have obtained one of the following subscriptions through the Microsoft 365 admin center (that is, Web Direct):

- Paid or trial subscription of Dynamics 365 Customer Service Enterprise
- Paid or trial subscription of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't have one of these subscriptions, or if you purchased your subscription somewhere other than Web Direct, then the option to try channels will not be available in the Microsoft 365 admin center. In such cases, we recommend that you use the [Customer Service trial](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/customer-service/overview/).

For information about the Digital Messaging license, pricing, and prerequisites, refer to the Dynamics 365 licensing guide [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544).

### Get a trial subscription of channels

1. Sign in to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) with the global administrator credentials.

2. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase Services**, scroll down, and select **Add-ons**.

3. Select **Dynamics 365 Customer Service Digital Messaging add-on Trial**.

4. You can start a 30-day trial of Digital Messaging with 25 user licenses.

5. After signing up for a trial, you must assign licenses of Digital Messaging to the users who need to engage with customers and provide support via Omnichannel for Customer Service. Select one or more active users and edit their product licenses. After you're done, select **Save**.

## Provision channels in your organization

Perform the tasks in [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](omnichannel-provision-license.md) to set up Omnichannel for Customer Service and enable Chat, SMS, and social channels in your organization.

After a channel is enabled in your organization, you can sign in to the Dynamics 365 organization, and select the Customer Service admin center or Omnichannel admin center app to start configuring the channel.

### Get a Power BI (free) subscription

If you already have a subscription of Dynamics 365 Customer Service Enterprise or a subscription of Power BI in your tenant, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you must get a Power BI (free) subscription.

# View and understand Omnichannel intraday insights dashboards 

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The **Omnichannel intraday insights** dashboards provide information about the health and key performance indicators (KPIs) for your organization. From the Omnichannel intraday insights report, you can view a summary of the following sections.

- [Conversations insights](#conversations-insights)
- [Agent insights](#agent-insights)

The information displayed in these sections is based on the conversations that have been closed in the last 24 hours, and is refreshed every 15 minutes. The report fetches the latest data and is generated in real time. If the report is kept open in a pre-configured Power BI workspace, it's automatically refreshed after 15 minutes; in a customer-configured workspace, the report is refreshed after every 5 minutes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To help ensure that the most accurate and up-to-date data is displayed on the dashboard, be sure to follow [best practices for using Omnichannel for Customer Service](best-practices.md).

## Omnichannel intraday insights dashboard

The **Omnichannel intraday insights** tab provides information on conversations insights, agent insights and their performance.


### Conversations insights

The **Conversations insights** section provides insights about conversation requests that have been generated in the past 24 hours, with KPIs such as the number and state of the conversations. The following image shows an example of the **Conversations insights** section of the Omnichannel intraday insights report.


This section of the dashboard displays the following KPIs about conversations.


| Metric | Description |
|-------|-------|
| Average wait time per conversation | For a conversation, wait time is defined as the cumulative wait time of its individual sessions. This KPI is calculated as an average that considers only closed conversations. Session wait time is defined as the elapsed time between the creation of a session and the time that an agent is assigned. |
| Exceeding 5 mins wait time | The number of conversations that are open and have exceeded the threshold wait time of five minutes. |
| Exceeding 5 mins wrap time | The number of conversations that are open and have exceeded the threshold wrap time of five minutes. | 
| Average handle time per conversation | For a conversation, the handle time used to calculate the average is defined as the cumulative handle time of its individual sessions. *Session handle time* is defined as the elapsed time between the creation of a session and the time that it's closed. More information: [Average handle time](#average-handle-time)|
| Exceeding 5 mins handle time | The number of active conversations that are exceeding the handle time threshold of five minutes. |

### Agent insights

The **Agent insights** section provides information about the latest KPIs, the health of the queues, and the status of agents on a given day. The agent insights section consolidates conversations in both live chat and digital messaging platforms. An example of the **Agent insights** section is shown in the following image.

### Ongoing conversations

The **Ongoing conversations** section provides information about the status of the conversation and its wait time, and is also where you can assign the conversation to agents based on their status and capacity. You can reassign the conversation to a different queue by using the ongoing conversations report. This report also displays information about the channel through which the conversation came in, along with the time and date that the conversation was picked up.

The **Ongoing conversations** table displays the following metrics.

| Title | The title of the case |
|------------ | --------------- |
| Agent | Name of the agent |
| Status | The status of the conversation |
| Action | The action that can be taken on the conversation |
| Queue | The name of the queue that the conversation is a part of |
| Channel | The name of the channel that the conversation came through |
| Wait time (min) | Total wait time of the conversation |
| Handle time (min) | Total time taken to accept and close the conversation |
| Wrap time (min) | Total time in which the conversation was in the wrap stage |
| Sentiment |                 |
| Created on | The date on which the conversation was created on |
| Conversation ID | The conversation's ID |

### Assign a conversation

You can assign a conversation to another agent or route it to another queue through the ongoing conversations report. Select the **Assign** option in the **Action** column in the report. Select an available agent, and then select **Assign**.If no agent is available, you can move the conversation to another queue and check whether an agent is available. After an agent is assigned, the action is changed to **Monitor**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can assign a conversation when it's in any state except **Closed**. 


## View and filter reports

You can filter information by selecting the queues that have been defined for your organization. From the **Omnichannel queues** drop-down list, select the queues you want, and the information will be filtered according to your selection. This helps you quickly analyze the KPIs and take any necessary steps to improve outcomes.

## Average handle time

The average handle time for a conversation is defined as the cumulative handle times of its individual sessions. The session handle times take into account only the active time of agents. The average handle time for an agent is calculated based on the active time the agent spends in a session from the time the conversation is active until it's closed. This includes the time the agent takes to wrap up the conversation. When an agent concurrently handles multiple customers and switches sessions, the active time for the previous session is paused and the active time for the current session resumes. 

If the agent spends time providing consultation, it's included in the agent's average handle time. Similarly, for supervisors, the monitor time is included in the supervisor's average handle time.
When a conversation is transferred, the active time spent by all agents who are involved is summed up to compute the handle time for the conversation.

Average handle time will be accurately calculated if you ensure the following:

- Agents close the sessions by selecting the **Close** button at the end of their shift. More information: [Conversation in waiting status](oc-conversation-state.md)
- Agents don't change the computer time.
- Agents don't use incognito mode in Google Chrome or private browsing in Microsoft Edge.

When an agent steps away from the desk during an ongoing session and doesn't interact with the customer, the system counts this time as active and subsequently computes a higher value for the handle time. For a more realistic report of the active time that agents spend in the session, you can configure the idle time threshold. If no agent activity is detected after the idle time threshold is reached, the handle time computation is paused. The computation resumes if any mouse, touch, or keyboard activity is detected. By default, the idle time threshold isn't enabled out of the box. More information: [Set the idle time threshold](set-idle-time-threshold.md)

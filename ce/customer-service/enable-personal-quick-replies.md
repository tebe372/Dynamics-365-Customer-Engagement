# Enable personal quick replies for agents

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

You can allow agents to create their own personal quick replies that are stored in the agent's context and which the agent can invoke by using the associated tags during a session with a customer. Agents can use personal quick replies to respond to customer queries efficiently with minimal turnaround time.

As an administrator, you can use a Power Automate utility to delete unused tags.

## Enable personal quick replies

1. In the Omnichannel Administration app, go to **Agent Experience**, and select **Personal quick replies**.
2. On the **Personal quick replies** tab, set the **Allow agents to create personal quick replies** toggle to **Yes**.

The settings for creating personal quick replies is made available for agents.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - It can take up to 15 minutes for the setting to take effect.
> - We recommend that you do not assign the System administrator role to agents or supervisors to avoid enabling access to other users personal quick replies on the **Quick replies** panel of a conversation.

# Integrate a Power Virtual Agents bot

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-trial-sign-up](../includes/cc-trial-sign-up.md)]

Microsoft Power Virtual Agents allows organizations to automate routine conversations, letting agents focus on high-value interactions. When a conversation is escalated from a bot to a human agent, the agent can see the full transcript of the bot conversation and get complete context while engaging with the customer.

After you've created your bot and connected it to an Omnichannel for Customer Service environment, you can go to the [Customer Service admin center](cs-admin-center.md) or Omnichannel admin center app to add your bot to queues and configure context variables to route work items.

When you integrate a Power Virtual Agents bot with Omnichannel for Customer Service, you get the following capabilities for bot conversations:

- Seamlessly integrate your bot with all channels without needing to add channel-specific code in the bot.
- Transfer bot conversations to human agents, and include the full context of the conversation.
- Analyze the bot transcript that's available in Microsoft Dataverse after the chat is completed.
- Configure routing rules to selectively route incoming requests to bots based on context, such as issue type or customer type. For example, you can route low-complexity issues to bots, or route the conversation to a sales or support bot based on the webpage browsing history of the customer.
- Monitor the bot conversations in real time by using the supervisor dashboard, which includes details such as customer sentiment.
- Use the historical dashboards to get insights into the effectiveness of the bots through metrics, such as resolution rate, escalation rate, resolution time, escalation time, and average sentiment.

## Prerequisites

Before you integrate Power Virtual Agents bots in Omnichannel for Customer Service, check the following:

1. You must have the following licenses:

    - A product license for Power Virtual Agents. More information: [Licensing for Power Virtual Agents](/power-virtual-agents/requirements-licensing-subscriptions)

    - A product license for chat, digital messaging, or voice channel for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, depending on your business requirements.
1. You must have the Omnichannel administrator role. More information: [Manage user roles](add-users-assign-roles.md)
1. You'll need an application registered on the Azure portal before connecting to Omnichannel for Customer Service. More information: [Register an application with Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/develop/how/power-virtual-agents/requirements-licensing-subscriptionsto-create-service-principal-portal#create-an-azure-active-directory-application)
1. You must have a preconfigured bot that can integrate with Omnichannel for Customer Service. More information: [Configure seamless and contextual hand-off to Omnichannel for Customer Service](/power-virtual-agents/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel)

## Install Power Virtual Agents extensions

Power Virtual Agents lets you seamlessly hand off voice and text-based conversations to human agents using the chat, digital messaging, and voice channels in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. For your bot to hand off conversations to the omnichannel interface, you must install the Power Virtual Agents extension solutions for Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

To do so, perform the following steps:

1. [Ensure the prerequisites are met](/power-virtual-agents/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel#prerequisites).
2. [Install the extension solutions](/power-virtual-agents/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel#install-extension-solutions).
3. Verify if the extension solutions are successfully installed by checking whether the extension solution variables are available in Power Virtual Agents.

## Connect your Power Virtual Agents bot to omnichannel instance

Follow the procedure in the section [Connect omnichannel to your Power Virtual Agents bot](/power-virtual-agents/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel#connect-your-bot-to-omnichannel-for-customer-service) to connect your Power Virtual Agents bot to the omnichannel instance.

## Configure your Power Virtual Agents bot in the admin app

In Customer Service admin center or Omnichannel admin center, select the Power Virtual Agents bot from the list of bots in the **Workstreams** area, so the bot can be used to hand off conversations to human agents. For more information, see [Add a bot to a workstream](create-workstreams.md#add-a-bot-to-a-workstream).

> [!NOTE]
> Bots can receive conversations only if they're added to push-based workstreams.

## Configure your Power Virtual Agents bot in Omnichannel Administration

[!INCLUDE[cc-omnichannel-administration-deprecation-note.md](../includes/cc-omnichannel-administration-deprecation-note.md)]

In Omnichannel Administration, after the Power Virtual Agents bot is created and configured to work with Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can configure it to hand off conversations to queues. To receive incoming messages, you must add the bot to at least one queue. The bot will use the routing rules that were created at setup.

1. Connect the bot to Omnichannel for Customer Service and go to the Omnichannel Administration app. More information: [Configure seamless and contextual hand-off to Omnichannel for Customer Service](/dynamics365/ai/customer-service-virtual-agent/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel)

2. Assign the bot to an existing queue.

    ![Virtual Agent bot select queue.](media/virtual-agent-bot-select-queues.png)

3. Select **Done**. Now you're on the bot profile page and you can see that your bot is connected.

    ![Virtual Agent bot profile page.](media/virtual-agent-bot-profile.png)

    Your bot is ready to accept and respond to customer-initiated conversations.

## Set escalation rules

You can set escalation rules so the bot can route the queries to the appropriate agent. You can set up escalation rules in one of the following ways:

- **Add the bot to an existing human agent queue**: If you add the bot to an existing human agent queue, you don’t need to change your existing routing rule. Existing routing rules will send incoming messages to the Power Virtual Agents bot. When a handoff is triggered, customers will be transferred from the Power Virtual Agents bot to the human agent according to the escalation routing rules.

- **Create a bot queue and a human agent queue**: If you create two queues, you must create workstreams that contain context variables and appropriate routing rules to route the customer queries. More information: [Work with queues in Omnichannel for Customer Service](queues-omnichannel.md)

### Create a bot queue and a human agent queue

1. Select or create a workstream. More information: [Understand and create workstreams](create-workstreams.md)

![Virtual Agent workstreams.](media/virtual-agent-work-streams.png)

2. Create context variables.

You must use the context variables that were created during setup for the bot to handle the customer queries appropriately. The context variable is used in routing the incoming customer queries to the appropriate bots and agents. More information: [Contextual variables available upon hand-off](/dynamics365/ai/customer-service-virtual-agent/how-to-handoff#contextual-variables-available-upon-hand-off)

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Virtual Agent workstream context variable.](media/virtual-agent-work-stream-context-variables.png "Virtual Agent workstream context variable")

3. Create a routing rule for the human agent and add it to the workstream.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Virtual Agent workstream routing rules.](media/virtual-agent-work-stream-routing-rule.png "Virtual Agent workstream routing rules")

4. Create a routing rule for the virtual agent and add it to the workstream.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Virtual Agent workstream bot routing rules.](media/virtual-agent-work-stream-routing-rule-bot.png "Virtual Agent workstream bot routing rules")

Routing rules route the incoming customer queries to their respective queues. Each routing rule has a condition and a destination queue. If the condition is evaluated as true, the customer query is routed to the destination queue. For bots, the condition is built by using the context variable.

Bots are developed to receive customer queries first, gain information of the query, and then pass the query to a human agent, if required. To achieve this behavior, you must add a bot user to the queue and configure routing rules in a way that the incoming customer queries are routed to the queue with bot user.

Be sure to map the routing rules to the correct queues so that the queries are routed appropriately. More information: [Create and manage routing rules](routing-rules.md)

> [!NOTE]
> When you run a report on Power Virtual Agents activity, the number of bot sessions may differ from the number of sessions in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

## Enable a human agent to transfer a conversation back to a bot

The previous section explained how to configure a single conversation transfer from a Power Virtual Agents bot to a human agent. Some support scenarios may require a human agent to transfer a conversation back to a Power Virtual Agents bot after delivering personalized support. This second transfer from human agent to bot may be used to provide further assistance with basic, repetitive tasks, or to collect additional data, as in a customer survey.

You can facilitate the transfer of a conversation from a human agent back to a bot in the following ways:

- Create two bots that reside in two queues
- Create two bots that reside in the same queue

### Two bots in two queues

In this scenario, a bot has transferred a conversation to a human agent. The human agent will transfer the conversation again to another bot in another queue.

1. A customer starts a conversation.
2. The conversation is routed to Queue 1.
3. The first bot (Bot A) accepts the conversation.
4. The customer requests to chat with a human agent.
5. The conversation is transferred to a human agent within Queue 1.
6. The customer converses with the human agent.
7. The human agent has completed delivering support and wants to hand off the conversation to a second bot (Bot B), which resides in Queue 2.
8. The human agent is disconnected from the conversation.
9. The conversation routed to Bot B in Queue 2.
10. The system triggers Bot B to send a greeting message.
11. The customer now chats with Bot B.

### Two bots in one queue

In this scenario, after a bot has transferred a conversation to a human agent, the agent will transfer the conversation to another bot in the same queue when the agent's task is over. For the conversation to flow correctly, you must set the first bot (Bot A) with the highest capacity, the human agent with the next highest capacity, and the second bot (Bot B) with the lowest capacity.

1. A customer starts a conversation that is routed to a queue.
2. The first bot (Bot A) that has the highest capacity accepts the conversation.
3. The customer requests to chat with a human agent.
4. The conversation is transferred to a human agent as the agent has second-highest capacity.
5. The customer chats with the human agent.
6. The human agent has finished delivering support and wants to hand off the conversation to a second bot (Bot B), which resides in the same queue.
7. The human agent is disconnected from the conversation, and the conversation is routed to Bot B.
8. Bot B receives the messages in the following order:
    - A conversation update that the “Bot is added”
    - The Omnichannel Set context event
9. The system triggers Bot B to send a greeting message.
10. The customer now chats with Bot B.

## Configure context variables for the bot

When customers initiate a conversation, the relevant context that is related to the customer, the issue they are facing, and recent activities performed by them can be made available for the bot to intelligently provide contextual responses to resolve customer issues in a quick and efficient manner. For example, the bot can use the signed-in user details to look up the recent case information or order history of the customer and provide a response. Similarly, the pre-conversation information, custom context, or recent pages browsed on a website by the customer can be passed on to the bot by configuring context variables for the bot in Power Virtual Agents. Context variables set by the bot can also be passed to Omnichannel for Customer Service when the bot escalates to the human agent. For example, you can pass the ticketnumber for the case created by the bot to Omnichannel for Customer Service to link the case and load the customer summary for the agent to view.

For information on the context variables that can be configured, see [Context variables for bots](context-variables-for-bot.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure the following:
>
> - Names are not changed and used "as is" when you author flows.
> - The value that'll be passed to the context variable doesn't exceed 4,000 characters so that the conversation can be successfully escalated to the human agent.

In Power Virtual Agents, do the following:

1. On the **Topics** page, select **New topic**.
2. On the **Setup** tab, enter a name and description, and save the topic.
3. Select **Go to authoring canvas**.
4. Select **Add node**, choose the **Ask a question** action.
5. Edit the **Identify** field, and in the **Choose information to identify** dialog box, select an option that will match the context variable data type. For information on the data type mapping, see the information in the table in [context variables](context-variables-for-bot.md).
6. Edit **Save response as**, and in the **Variable Properties** dialog, update the value for **Name** with the required Omnichannel for Customer Service context variable. Make sure **Bot (any topic can access)** and **External sources can set values** are selected. The **External sources can set values** option is applicable only for getting the context variable.
    > ![Configure context variable in a topic.](media/Configure-bot-context-variable.png "Configure context variable in a topic")

8. Save and publish the changes.

At run time, the required information is captured in the context variable that can then be used for further actions based on the workflow you configure. The bot can set the information for the context variables to link the conversation and case when the bot escalates the conversation to an agent. More information: [Link customer and case to a conversation](link-customer-case-when-bot-escalates.md)

You can also configure the **Transfer to agent** node in the Power Virtual Agents topic to send a private message with relevant context variables to the live agent during the escalation.

The global variables that are created in Power Virtual Agents can be passed to Omnichannel for Customer Service when a conversation is escalated. For the complete list, see [Contextual variables available upon hand off](/power-virtual-agents/advanced-hand-off#contextual-variables-available-upon-hand-off).

## When is a conversation closed in Omnichannel for Customer Service

When a bot receives a conversation that's subsequently not escalated to a human agent, the conversation is closed if the customer abandons it. The conversation will also be closed automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity.

This conversation will then appear in the **Closed** state in the Omnichannel for Customer Service dashboard and in **Resolved/abandoned** state in the Power Virtual Agents dashboard. For more information on the state of conversations, see [Session outcomes over time chart](/power-virtual-agents/analytics-summary#session-outcomes-over-time-chart).

## End bot conversation

To configure a Power Virtual Agents web app bot to end a conversation, see [End conversation](/power-virtual-agents/authoring-create-edit-topics#end-the-conversation).

## Privacy notice

You understand that your data may be transmitted and shared with external systems and that your data may flow outside of your organization's compliance boundary (even if your organization is in a Government Cloud environment). For example, your messages will be shared with the bot which could be interacting with a third-party system based on the integration done by you.

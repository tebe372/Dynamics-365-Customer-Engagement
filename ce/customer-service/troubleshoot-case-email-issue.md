# Issue converting an email into a case in the Customer Service Hub

## Issue

- Incoming email is not being converted to a case in the Customer Service Hub app in Dynamics 365.
- An email activity is created in CRM but a related Queueitem is not found.

## Workaround

If an incoming email is not being converted to a case even after configuring automatic record creation and update rules, validate the configurations and validation steps given in the following table:


|Option in Automatic Record Creation and Update Rule in Service Management  |If selected as  |Validation steps  |Outcome  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Create a case if a valid entitlement exists for the customer     |  Yes     |  Validate that an active entitlement exists for the customer. Valid active entitlement is evaluated as below:  </br> - If the sender of the email is a contact with a parent account, then Dynamics 365 creates a case if the contactâ€™s parent account has a valid entitlement, and the contact is listed in the Contacts section of the entitlement </br> OR </br> - If the Contacts section is empty (which means that the entitlement is applicable to all contacts for the customer) |   A case is created      |
|Create a case from an email sent by unknown senders     |   Yes       |        For any incoming email from an unknown sender |     - A case is created </br>  - A contact is also created for the unknown sender|
|     |   Yes      |    For an incoming email with email address of inactive account or contact     |   - A case is created </br> - An inactive account or contact is activated|
|     |   No      |     For an incoming email with email address of active account or contact   |  A case is created       |
|    |     No    |      For an incoming email sent by record type other than account or contact   |    No case is created     |
|  |   No      |     For an incoming email with email address of inactive account or contact    |  No case is created           |
|Create a case for activities associated with a resolved case     |    Yes     |   For an incoming email related to a resolved case      |    A case is created     |
|   |    Yes      |   For an incoming email related to an active case         |   No case is created      |
|  |         |         |         |


## Troubleshooting steps
 
To resolve the issue: An email activity is created in CRM but a related Queueitem is not found


- Check if the active automatic record creation and update rule exist for the specific queue. If it exists, Queueitem has been marked as inactive and hence it does not appear in the Queueitem View. It also implies that the email activity has already been created and processed.

# Issue converting an email to a case

## Issue

Incoming email is not being converted to a case.


## Troubleshooting steps
 
If the email to case conversion is not working, follow the below troubleshooting steps to diagnose and fix the issue:

**Step 1**. Check if the email is syncing with the system. </br>
- **Action**: Navigate to **Activities** and look for Email activity.</br>
- **Comment**: If email is not syncing with the system, there may be an issue with the email router or server-side sync configuration. 

**Step 2**.  Notice that an email activity is created but a related QueueItem is not found.  </br>

- **Comment**: If an active Automatic Record Creation and Update Rule exists for a specific queue, QueueItem is marked as inactive and hence it disappears from the QueueItem View. 


**Step 3**. If the email is coming from an unknown sender,  check for the **Create contact for unknown sender** option. 
- **Action**: Go to **Automatic Record Creation and Update Rule** configuration and check if the **Create contact for unknown sender** box is checked. </br>

- **Comment**: If **Create contact for unknown sender** check box is unchecked, incoming email from unknown sender will not be converted to a case.

**Step 4**: Check if **Automatic Record Creation and Update Rule** is configured properly. 

- **Action**: Go to system jobs and check for any failure message. 
 
For more information about configuration failure scenarios and resolution for sample configuration failure, see [Configuration failure scenarios and resolutions](#configuration-failure-scenarios-and-resolutions).


> [!NOTE]
>  The Customer field in the case entity can be a contact or an account. If a matching incoming email address is not found for a contact or an account, and **Create contact for unknown sender** box is checked, the system creates contact for incoming email address and links it to the case's customer field.

**Step 5**: Check if the contact and account exist with the same incoming email address. 
- **Comment**: Case created from incoming email will resolve customer field on case as Account.

**Step 6**: Ensure that the queue email address is in the **To** or **Cc** fields of incoming mails. Emails sent with the queue address in the **Bcc** field will not be processed.

## Configuration failure scenarios and resolutions

Given below is a list of some common issue scenarios and their resolutions.
 
**Sample**: Configuration on Automatic Record Creation and Update Rule
- **Create contact for unknown sender** box should be checked.
- Set condition criteria to **Any incoming email**.
- Add action to create case, select **View properties** and set the case fields as per business use case.

#### Scenario 1

In the Customer field of the Case Details section, **Senders Account (Email)** is set as below value.

This results in the following error in system jobs:

![error-email-case](media/error-email-case.png)

To resolve this issue, keep the Customer field blank or set it to **{Sender(Email)}**. This allows the system to automatically create contact for the unknown sender and link it to the case.

#### Scenario 2

The Customer field is set as **{Senders Account(Email)}** and Contact field as **{Sender(Email)}**.

![error-email-case-contact](media/error-email-case-contact.png)

This results in the following error in system jobs:

![case-email-error](media/case-email-error.png)

To resolve this issue, keep the Customer field blank or set it to **{Sender(Email)}**. This allows the system to automatically create contact for the unknown sender and link it to the case.

#### Scenario 3

The Customer field and Contact field are set as **{Sender(Email)}**.

This results in the following error in system jobs:

To resolve this issue, leave contact field blank and set Customer field either to blank or to **{Sender(Email)}**.

## Validation steps

You must validate the configuration and validation steps given in the following table to understand the main cause of the issue, and resolve it:

|Option in Automatic Record Creation and Update Rule in Service Management  |If selected as  |Validation steps  |Outcome  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Create a case if a valid entitlement exists for the customer     |  Yes     |  Validate that an active entitlement exists for the customer. Valid active entitlement is evaluated as below:  </br> - If the sender of the email is a contact with a parent account, then Dynamics 365 Customer Service creates a case if the contactâ€™s parent account has a valid entitlement, and the contact is listed in the Contacts section of the entitlement </br> OR </br> - If the Contacts section is empty (which means that the entitlement is applicable to all contacts for the customer) |   A case is created      |
|Create a case from an email sent by unknown senders     |   Yes       |        For any incoming email from an unknown sender |     - A case is created </br>  - A contact is also created for the unknown sender|
|     |   Yes      |    For an incoming email with email address of inactive account or contact     |   - A case is created </br> - An inactive account or contact is activated|
|     |   No      |     For an incoming email with email address of active account or contact   |  A case is created       |
|    |     No    |      For an incoming email sent by record type other than account or contact   |    No case is created     |
|  |   No      |     For an incoming email with email address of inactive account or contact    |  No case is created           |
|Create a case for activities associated with a resolved case     |    Yes     |   For an incoming email related to a resolved case      |    A case is created     |
|   |    Yes      |   For an incoming email related to an active case         |   No case is created      |
|  |         |         |         |

# Define parent and child case settings

In Dynamics 365 Customer Service,  you can track multiple issues for a customer, or track the same issue that's affecting multiple customers, using parent and child cases. For example, you could track a case where work needs to be done by other departments. The primary case or issue is called the **Parent** case. Any related cases are called **Child** cases. Before your service team can start using this feature, you need to go to service management and set up a few rules about how information is inherited. 

> [!NOTE]
> With the latest release of Dynamics 365 Customer Service app, parent child case settings in service management are available in the Customer Service Hub. We recommend that you create and manage parent child case settings using the new experience.
  
## Set parent and child case attributes  (Customer Service Hub)
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_custsvcmgr_sysadmin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-custsvcmgr-sysadmin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)] [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. In the Customer Service Hub sitemap, go to **Service Management** and select **Case Settings** > **Parent Child Case Settings**.  
  
3. In the **Case Settings** dialog box, select the attributes that the child case will inherit from the parent case.  

   You can view **Available** and **Selected** attributes in the form of two lists. Using the arrows **>**, **<**, **>>**, and **<<**, you can move the attributes from one list to another. 
  
4. You can also select a case closure setting that defines how parent and child cases are closed. Select one of the case closure preference for parent and child cases:  
  
   - **Close all child cases when parent case is closed**: As soon as the parent case is closed, all the child cases are also closed.
   - **Don't allow parent case closure until all child cases are closed**: The parent case can’t be closed until all the child cases are closed.
  
5. When you’re done, select **OK**.

   - **Close all child cases when parent case is closed**: The parent case can’t be closed until all the child cases are closed.  
  
    > [!NOTE]

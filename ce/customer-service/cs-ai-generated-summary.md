Share an AI-generated summary of a customer conversation to easily collaborate on a case. A summary quickly provides context and relays steps you've already taken to solve the issue. You can summarize all conversations that take place on messaging channels such as Live Chat, SMS, or WhatsApp. This feature also supports bot to agent conversations, voice conversations with transcription enabled, and Microsoft Teams conversations.

> [!NOTE]
>  - Auto-summarization for conversations is in preview for messaging channels and voice conversations with transcription enabled.
>  - This feature is generally available for Microsoft Teams conversations.

You can also perform the following actions:

    If your administrator has turned on AI and rules-based suggestions, the system suggests contacts you might want to chat with. They include contacts who have experience resolving similar cases or who are related to the current case. You can select more than one contact if you want to start a group chat.

    Before you start the chat, you can:

    - Edit the summary to provide more details.
    - Share feedback about the summary.
    - Clear the **Include a note** checkbox to skip including the summary and start the Teams chat without an introduction.

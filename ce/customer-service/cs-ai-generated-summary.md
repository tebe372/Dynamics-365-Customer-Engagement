# AI-generated summary for ongoing conversations in Microsoft Teams

## Introduction

If your administrator has enabled the AI-generated introductory message and configured the ability to link chats to Dynamics 365 records, you can view and share the AI-generated summary of an ongoing conversation to an expert who can resolve the customer's issue. This reduces the time spent in providing context or summarizing the steps taken to solve the issue, enabling you to provide a quick resolution.

## AI-generated summary based on ongoing conversation 

In the Customer Service workspace, when you open a case, Teams chat (Preview) appears in the app side pane on the right. You can do the following:

- Select **New linked chat**. The following options appear:

    - An option to enter participant agent names to create linked chats.
    - A dropdown list of suggested contacts who have worked on similar and related cases. AI and rules-based suggested contacts are listed if admins have enabled both of these options.
    - If AI-suggested contacts is enabled, a Resolved similar cases section is displayed in the dropdown list.
    - If AI-generated summary is enabled, a summary of the chat is displayed in the dropdown list.

- The default AI-generated summary is displayed with the following details, if the **Include introduction message (preview)** checkbox is enabled. Select the **Include introduction message (preview)** checkbox  based on the ongoing conversation with the customer:
    - The issue description: the key customer problems to solve in a conversation
    - The resolution steps: resolution steps the agent has already tried to solve the issue.

- You can perform the following actions:
    - Edit the auto-generated summary to provide additional details.
    - Share feedback about the summary.
    - Clear the **Include introduction message (preview)** checkbox to disable the auto-generated summary and start the Microsoft Teams chat.  

- Type a participant name or select from the suggested contacts. You can select more than one contact and then select **Start chat**. A conversation is initiated. The AI-generated summary appears on the chat as the introductory message.

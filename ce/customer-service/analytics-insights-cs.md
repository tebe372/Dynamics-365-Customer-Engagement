Customer Service Insights is now part of the embedded experience for Customer Service Hub and Customer Service Workspace, giving you an easy way to monitor and improve your support operations. Built-in dashboards, interactive charts, and visual filters provide views into support operations data across channels, and highlight areas for improvement that can have the greatest impact, helping you quickly evaluate and respond to key performance indicators (KPIs) and customer satisfaction levels.  

Customer Service Insights uses AI-generated topics to automatically group your cases, from across different channels, using natural language understanding. As a supervisor, you can see view notable trends in metrics sorted by topics, channels, queues, and agents. By better understanding what impacts your support operations you can feel empowered to make more informed decisions about how to improve resolution rates, reduce wait times, and decrease customer service costs.

By pinpointing and fixing issues before they impact customers, you can adapt to current and emerging trends, improve brand sentiment, and deliver better customer service experiences.

### Dashboard overview

The Insights dashboards for Customer Service contain a variety of charts and metrics to help you to understand the factors that have the greatest impact on your customer service.

#### KPI insights 

Important subjects that impact performance.  

#### Topics to watch 

Topics that rank high across the following three key areas are shown under Topics to watch, to make it easier for customer service managers to discover top issues: 

- Volume driver shows topics with the largest volume of cases created in the selected time period. 

- Negative CSAT impact shows topics that have the greatest negative impact on your total CSAT score. CSAT data is collected from surveys. 

- The emerging rate gives you a "heads-up" about topics that have a high rate of new incoming cases in the selected time period. 

When you select the light bulb icon, a short inline explanation of the reason for showing these topics is displayed with recommendations of possible actions to take.

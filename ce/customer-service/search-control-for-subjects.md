# Enable search control for subjects in custom forms


## Introduction

The search control for the subject entity provides intuitive and fast search results, the search term is highlighted in the results, and allows for easy removal of the search string with a single click.

The search control for the subject entity is available out of the box in the following forms:

- Case for Multisession experience
- Case for Interactive experience
- Case Quick Create for Multisession
- Case Quick Create

## Enable the search control for subjects

Perform the following steps to enable the search control for subjects on custom forms:

1. In Dynamics 365, go to **Customizations** in **Advanced Settings**.

2. Select **Customize the System** to open the default solution.

3. Under **Components**, expand **Entities**, select **Case**, and then select **Forms**.

4. In the list of forms, open the form that you want to edit.

5. Select the **Subject** field in the form, and double-click it.

# Set a default knowledge article authoring language for your organization

You can set a default knowledge article authoring language for your organization, but also give your agents the ability to personalize it according to their choice. Your agents might prefer to author knowledge articles in a language other than the language that is set for your organization. Agents can also change the language for different articles.

Review the hierarchy as described in the table below. The ability to override follows the hierarchy order at the individual articles, agent or knowledge manager, and then the administrator.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The settings you configure for knowledge article authoring on the **Settings** page won't apply when you create a knowledge article by converting a case. In such cases, the knowledge articles will be created in English.

# Create quick replies

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Quick replies are predefined messages that can be created for agents to quickly respond to common questions from customers. For information about the agent's quick reply experience, see [Send quick replies](oc-conversation-control.md#send-quick-replies).  

**To create quick replies**

1. In Dynamics 365, go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.

   ### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)

    - In the site map, in **Agent experience**, select **Productivity**.
   
   ### [Omnichannel admin center](#tab/omnichanneladmincenter) 

     - In the site map, in **Advanced settings**, select **Agent experience**.

1. Select **Manage** for **Quick replies**.

1. To create a quick reply, select **New**, or to edit an existing quick reply, select the name of the quick reply.

1. Provide or change the following information:

    - **Title:** Enter the title of the message.
    - **Locale:** Specify the language of the message.
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > Omnichannel for Customer Service does not localize quick replies. To provide quick replies in multiple languages, create a separate quick reply for each language and select its corresponding locale.

    - **Message:** Enter the text of the message. To use chat dynamic text (also called slugs), select the plus icon next to the name of the dynamic text slug you want to use. The dynamic text populates in the **Message** field.

      > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
      > ![Create a quick reply.](media/oc-create-a-quick-reply.png "Create a quick reply")

     The **Message** field supports the following chat dynamic text (slugs).  

    | Chat dynamic text (slug) | Description |
    |-----------------|-----------------------------|
    | {FullName{Customer}}  | The full name of the customer who initiated the conversation. |
    | {FirstName{Customer}} | The first name of the customer.
    | {LastName{Customer}}| The last name of the customer.|
    | {FullName{Agent}}| The full name of the agent who is assigned to the conversation.|
    | {FirstName{Agent}}| The first name of the agent.|
    | {LastName{Agent}}| The last name of the agent.|
    | {Nickname{Agent}}| The nickname for the agent.|
    |||

    If you have defined a context key, you can create a quick reply that contains dynamic text that corresponds to that context key in the following format: {OCContext.contextKey1}, where "contextKey1" in the syntax is a placeholder for the predefined custom context field in the conversation. For example, {OCContext.OrderID} would be a context key that populates the message field with the Order ID for a record. More information: [Add context variables](manage-context-variables.md#add-context-variables) and [setContextProvider](customer-service/developer/reference/methods/setcontextprovider)

   > ![Context key format examples.](media/contextkey-format.png "Context key format examples")


1. Select **Save**.

## Create or edit tags for common categories of quick replies

Quick replies can be classified and tagged into categories. The categorization capability can also be used to group quick replies into logical chunks that represent key conversational states for agents. These logical chunks help agents select appropriate messages that correspond to customer issues.

1. In the site map of Omnichannel admin center, select **Agent experience** under **Advanced settings**, and then select **Manage** for **Quick replies**. In the Omnichannel Administration app, go to **Agent Experience** > **Quick replies**.

2. Select two or more quick replies for which you want to create a tag, and then select **Edit Tags**.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Active quick replies.](media/oc-active-quick-replies.png "Active quick replies")

  The **Edit Tags** dialog box appears.

3. In the **Add new tag** field, start typing the tag you want to create. If it already exists, it will appear in a list below the field. If it doesnâ€™t appear, select the **+** (plus sign) to add it.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Add a tag.](media/oc-quick-reply-add-tag.png "Add a tag")

4. After you're done, select **Close**.

## Associate quick replies with a workstream

For organizations with diverse lines of businesses, agents will send a variety of messages, depending on their area of expertise. Administrators can determine which quick replies are necessary for different groups of agents to use. Administrators can associate quick replies with workstreams to show agents only those quick replies that apply to them. If no workstream is associated, the quick reply is available for all agents.

1. In the site map of Omnichannel admin center, select **Agent experience** under **Advanced settings**, and then select **Manage** for **Quick replies**. In the Omnichannel Administration app, go to **Agent Experience** > **Quick replies**.

2. Select a quick reply from the list.

3. In the **Workstreams** section, select **Add Existing Work Stream**.

4. Select the workstream from the list of records, and then click **Add**.

   The workstream appears in the list.

5. Select **Save**.

   If you select the workstream in the list, you can view the workstream record, and see the quick replies associated with the workstream.

## Availability of quick replies and language settings

The quick replies that the agents will see is determined by the following parameters:

- The language mapped to the channel instance
- The language configured in the agent's personal settings
- The workstream the quick reply is mapped to

For example, when you set up a live chat widget or Facebook page, the quick replies will be available in the language that is configured for the chat widget or Facebook page. Then, when you associate the chat widget with a queue containing agents, the agent-specific language setting, if configured, will determine the language in which the quick replies will be available to the agents. The agents will see the quick replies mapped to the workstream that is associated with the channel with other quick replies.

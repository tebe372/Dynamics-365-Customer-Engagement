# View social profiles of contacts

Omnichannel for Customer Service creates a social profile for incoming requests from asynchronous channels. After a social profile is created for a conversation within a channel, later conversations are linked to the same social profile for the channel so that you can view all the related information in one place.

## How social profiles are linked with contacts

When a customer sends a message, a record is automatically created with the social profile for the channel by using the unique identifier for the customer.

With social profiles, you can do the following:

- [Automatically identify customers](record-identification-rule.md) on social channels
- Display the customer name or phone number with conversations and calls on the agent dashboard
- Send outbound messages

The social profiles are supported for the following channels.

| Channel            | Supported?                                                          | Visitor name|
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Apple Messages for Business | Yes                                                        | Visitor     |
| Facebook           | Yes                                                                 | User name |
| Google's Business Messages | Yes                                                         | Display name |
| LINE               | Yes                                                                 | Display name |
| Twitter            | Yes                                                                 | Twitter handle name |
| WeChat             | Yes                                                                 | Visitor |
| WhatsApp           | Yes                                                                 | Phone number |
| Custom messaging (Telegram) | Yes                                                        | User name |

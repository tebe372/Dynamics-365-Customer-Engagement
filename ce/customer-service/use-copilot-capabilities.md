# Use Copilot to solve customer issues

Copilot is an AI-powered tool that revolutionizes the agent experience in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. It provides real-time AI powered assistance that will help agents resolve issues faster, handle cases more efficiently, and automate time-consuming tasks so that they can focus on delivering high-quality service to their customers.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that your administrator has enabled the Copilot capabilities.

## Ask a question

When you sign into any of the Customer Service agent app, Copilot becomes activated on the right pane with the **Ask a question** tab in focus. Copilot acts as your partner that can help answer questions without you having to search knowledge sources or other articles for information.

### Draft questions

You can ask free form questions just as you'd ask your colleague or supervisor who might know the answer to it. With Copilot, you can do the following:

- **Ask a direct question**: Copilot will show the relevant answer from the trove of knowledge sources configured by your organization.
- **Ask follow-up turn by turn questions**: If Copilot isn't able to generate the right answer immediately, you can engage in a conversation and guide Copilot to provide the correct answer. This is done in a natural conversational manner, just as you would engage in a conversation with a colleague.
- **Ask Copilot to attempt a better response**: Copilot can also rephrase responses based on additional guidance such as “Can you summarize your response?” or “Can you attempt a response providing details for each of the steps you mentioned?”

If you are satisfied with the response that Copilot provides, you can use the whole or a part of it to answer the customer question.

### Use the responses

You can use the Copilot responses in multiple ways, such as follows:

- Copy manually the parts that you find useful into your chat or read out from it during a voice conversation. You can select the copy icon also to directly copy to clipboard.  
- Send to Customer: The “Send to customer” option is available when there is an active Omnichannel digital messaging conversation. Clicking “Send to Customer” opens an editing window within which the agent can make any modifications to the response provided by Copilot and send the response to the Customer directly without having to manually copy it. Agents can also change customer keywords based on which Copilot has generated the response, to create a more accurate response.
- Check sources: Clicking on the “Check sources” dropdown below the response provides relevant knowledge or website links from which the response was drawn from by Copilot. This can help as supplemental information in case it needs to be referred to by the agent or to send to the customer.

### Start over

Once a customer conversation has ended, or if the agent wants Copilot to disregard the conversation so far, agents can click the “Clear Chat” button at the bottom of the Copilot chat window.

# Overview of productivity tools

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

The Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools app provides capabilities that help users perform day-to-day operations in a fast, efficient, and process-compliant manner and deliver value to customers.

> The productivity pane and productivity tools are not available in Omnichannel for Customer Service on Unified Service Desk.

### Challenges

In the customer service industry, agents are expected to handle a large volume of customer issues and resolve them quickly with high customer satisfaction value while adhering to the process standards.

Whilst there are challenges such as:

- Too many clicks to perform actions, such as open, fill, and save forms.
- Repetitive or monotonous tasks, such as greet a customer, verify a customer, send acknowledgment mail, and take notes.
- Human errors introduced during copy paste of data across different pages.
- Process adherence and compliance that are specific to the contact center business organizations.
- Lack of real-time insights to the customer, knowledge articles, and other relevant needs based on the context of the interaction.

The Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools app contains the following functionality to help address these challenges, aiding users to perform day-to-day operations in a fast, efficient, and process-compliant manner.

- [Macros](#macros)
- [Agent scripts](#agent-scripts)
- [Smart assist](#smart-assist)

### Macros

With macros, agents can perform repetitive, monotonous tasks—Open model-driven app forms, pre-populate fields with the details, send an email to a customer, take notes, and much more—all in a single click. A macro is a set of sequential actions that tells the system how to complete a task. When an agent runs a macro, the system performs each action and this helps save time and accommodate agents to handle more customer issues. Also, macros provide preciseness, clarity, and consistency to the tasks that agents perform.

### Agent scripts

Agent scripts provide guidance to agents about what to do when they get a customer issue. The scripts ensure that only accurate, company-endorsed information is being shared, while also safeguarding the organization in regard to legal-compliance issues. Agent scripts help organizations to be unified, accurate, and effective while being quick and  efficient in handling customers.

### Smart assist

Smart assist is an intelligent assistant that provides real-time recommendations to agents, helping them take actions while interacting with customers. It allows organizations to build a custom bot and plug-in real-time to their environment. Also, organizations can develop relevant recommendations such as knowledge articles, similar cases, and next-best steps using Microsoft Adaptive cards. These recommendation cards are displayed on the agent user interface based on the context of the current conversation.

The smart assist feature can be enabled across all channels like Chat for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, SMS, and Facebook, except entity records, making it a consistent experience for agents.

## Agent guidance in productivity pane

The productivity pane, when enabled, displays the agent guidance control that shows the agent scripts, smart-assist cards, and knowledge search.

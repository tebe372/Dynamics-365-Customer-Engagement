# Verify migration of records

After you've successfully imported the configuration data related to unified routing from the source to target organization, do the following  in your target organization:

1. In your target organization, ensure that the unified routing configuration and rulesets are rendered properly as in the source organization.

2. If skills and rating values are used in unified routing rulesets, then you need to manually link, associate, or create the users, bookable resources, and bookable resources characteristics records.
  
3. If capacity profiles are used in rulesets and workstreams for unified routing, then you need to manually link, associate, or create the users, bookable resources, and bookable resources capacity profile records.

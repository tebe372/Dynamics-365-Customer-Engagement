# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Customer Service trial

Dynamics 365 Customer Service offers a 30-day free trial. After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data and even try out your own customer data. [Learn more about what Customer Service has to offer](/dynamics365/customer-service/overview).

**To sign up for the trial**:

1. Go to the [Try Dynamics 365 Customer Service](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/customer-service/overview/) page and select **Try for free**.
1. Follow the onscreen guidance to enter the [email associated with your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/what-is-a-microsoft-account-4a7c48e9-ff5a-e9c6-5a5c-1a57d66c3bfa) or your personal email ID, such as alansteiner@gmail.com, and your contact information.

> [!NOTE]
> - Check the availability of the product before you sign up for a trial.

The trial will take a few moments to load, then you can start using Customer Service.

## Experience for a trial user

Customer Service uses a Microsoft Power Platform environment to store and manage data. Provisioning an environment typically takes 15 to 60 minutes to complete. While an environment is getting provisioned, some functionalities aren't available, but you can perform minimal operations and explore the product. After the environment is provisioned, all functionalities become available. More information: [What is Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) and [Environments overview](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview)

This section lists all the functionality that will be restricted until an environment is provisioned. These restrictions apply to only for:

- The default environment.
- The trial users and users who purchase Customer Service through Microsoft 365 admin center.

### What you can do while an environment is being provisioned?

- Try the demo chat experience as an agent and customer that is available on the home page.
- [Understand how agents manage their cases and work on them](csw-overview.md).

### What you can't do while an environment is being provisioned?

Configure and use social, SMS, or Microsoft Teams channels in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

## What to try?

The trial environment includes many of the same features as the paid version. The following links will guide you through using some of the key features.

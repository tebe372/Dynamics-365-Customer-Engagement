# Configure a Facebook channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Many customers use social messaging channels like Facebook Messenger for their personal communication needs. Many also prefer using these messaging channels to engage with businesses. The asynchronous nature of these channels gives customers the convenience of getting their issues resolved as and when they find time, unlike real-time channels like Chat for Dynamics 365 where the session ends when the chat window is closed.

The Facebook channel gives you an incredible opportunity to capitalize on the social media trend and engage with your customers in a seamless and personalized experience.

**Prerequisites**: Following are the prerequisites before configuring the Facebook channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service:

1.	Create a Facebook page and enable Messenger. More information: [Create and Manage a Page and Messaging](https://www.facebook.com/help/994476827272050/?helpref=hc_fnav)
2.	Create a Facebook application. More information: [App Development](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/)
3.	Add Messenger and Webhooks to the Facebook application. More information: [Setting Up Your Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/app-setup/)

After completing the prerequisites, you can add the Facebook channel for your organization by following these steps:

  - [Step 1: Create a Facebook work stream](#step-1-create-a-facebook-work-stream)
  - [Step 2: Create a Facebook channel](#step-2-create-a-facebook-channel)
  - [Step 3: Create routing rules](#step-3-create-routing-rules)
  - [Step 4: Modify settings for a specific Facebook page](#step-4-modify-settings-for-a-specific-facebook-page)

## Step 1: Create a Facebook work stream

1. Sign in to Omnichannel Administration.

2. Go to **Work Distribution Management** > **Work Streams**.

3. Select **New** to create a Facebook work stream.

4. On the **Work Distribution** tab, in the **Channel** field, select **Facebook**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Create a Facebook work stream](media/fb-workstream.png "Create a Facebook work stream")

5. Specify other details as required. To learn more, see [Understand and create work streams](work-streams-introduction.md).

6. Select **Save**.

## Step 2: Create a Facebook channel

1. Go to **Channels** > **Facebook**.

2. Select **New** to create a Facebook channel.

3. On the **New Facebook Application** page, provide the following information:

    - **Name**: Name of the Facebook application. 

    - **Application Id**: ID of the Facebook application. To get the application ID, go to your Facebook application, select **Settings** > **Basic**, and copy the value in the **App ID** field.

    - **Application Secret**: Application secret of the Facebook application. To get the application secret, go to your Facebook application, select **Settings** > **Basic**, and copy the value in the **App Secret** field.


    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Register a Facebook application](media/fb-new-app.png "Register a Facebook application")

4. Select **Save**. After you save the record, the **Facebook Pages** section is enabled, and it allows you to add the Facebook pages through which a customer can connect to an agent.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this release, you can create only one Facebook application per organization. However, you can add multiple pages in a Facebook application.

5. In the **Facebook Pages** section, select **Add New Facebook Page** to add a Facebook page.

6. On the **New Facebook Page** page, **Account setup** tab, provide the following information:

    - **Page Id**: ID of the Facebook page. To get the page ID, go to your Facebook page, select **About**, and copy the value in the **Page ID** field.

    - **Page Name**: Name of the Facebook page.

    - **Page Access Token**: Page access token from the Facebook application. To get the page access token, go to your Facebook application and then go to **Messenger** > **Settings**. In the **Access Tokens** section, select the page, and copy the value in the **Page Access Token** field.

    - **Facebook Application**: The Facebook application record is auto filled from which you added a Facebook page.
    
    - **Work Stream**: Browse and select the work stream you created for the Facebook channel.

7. Select **Save** to create the record.

After you add a Facebook page, values for **Callback Uri** and **Verify Token** are generated automatically. These values are used to configure webhooks in the Facebook application.

   > [!Note]
   > You can add multiple Facebook **Page Id** (pages) to a **Facebook Application** channel. However, a Facebook **Page Id** can be linked to one **Facebook Application** only. If you link the same Facebook **Page Id** to multiple **Facebook Application** channels, then **Callback Uri** and **Verify Token** won't be generated automatically.

## Step 3: Create routing rules

1.	Go to **Work Distribution Management** > **Work Streams**.

2.	Open the work stream you created in Step 1.

3.	On the **Routing rules items** tab, create a routing rule to transfer the message to an appropriate agent. Select the entity as **Facebook Engagement Context**.

    For example, you can create a rule to transfer Facebook chat from a customer named Gilda to the default queue. 

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Facebook channel routing rule](media/fb-routing-rule.png "Facebook channel routing rule")

When you create conditions for routing rules, the **Facebook Engagement Context (Conversation)** entity enables you to set the following attributes:

  - **Customer name**: The customer name is shown in the format "first name, last name".
  - **Locale**: For a list of locales, see Facebook developer documentation.
  - **Timezone**: Timezone is shown as a number relative to GMT, for example, “5.5”
  - **User Page Scoped Id**: This is shown as a number string. 

## Step 4: Modify settings for a specific Facebook page

1. In the Omnichannel Administration app, go to your Facebook application and select the Facebook page you want to modify. 

2. On the **General settings** tab, provide the following information:
    
    - **Language**: Select the preferred language for your Facebook page.
    
    - **Work stream**: Select an existing work stream or create a new one.

    - **Enable file attachments for customers**: Set to **Yes** to allow customers to send file attachments to agents. Otherwise, set **No**. 

    - **Enable file attachments for agents**: Set to **Yes** to allow agents to send file attachments to customers. Otherwise, set **No**. 
    
       To learn more about attachments, see [Enable file attachments](enable-file-attachments.md). 
       
       To learn more about uploading media in Facebook, see [Facebook developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages). The availability and support of media is dependent on the third-party application, in this case, Facebook.

    <!--
    > [!Note]
    > In Europe, Facebook does not support video, audio, and file attachments. Only image files will appear in the conversation. To send a non-image file, Facebook recommends that users upload the file to a public repository and send the URL via Facebook.
    
    -->

    - **Turn on your Facebook human agent message tag**: Set to **Yes** to enable your agents to message customers after 24 hours have passed. When set to **No**, agents will be unable to respond to customers after 24 hours unless the customer sends another message. 
    
      If you enable the Facebook human agent message tag during an active conversation between the agent and customer, the agent must close the conversation and reopen it in order to communicate with customers after 24 hours of inactivity. Agents can initiate conversations with customers for up to 7 days.
    
      To use the Facebook human agent message tag, you must also turn it on in the Facebook app. For more information, see [Facebook Developer Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/?id=2616212338594331).

3. On the **Automated messages** tab, [configure automated messages](configure-automated-message.md). 
    
4. On the **Surveys** tab, [configure a post-conversation survey](configure-post-conversation-survey.md).

## Customer experience

A customer can initiate a conversation in any of the following ways:

- Messenger on the Facebook page
- [www.messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com/)
- Messenger app on a mobile device
- Messenger widget on a custom website

If a customer initiates a conversation from the Facebook page and then later switches to the mobile device, the previous conversation persists, and the customer can continue the conversation.

The agent receives the notification of the incoming conversation request. More information: [Use Facebook channel](facebook.md)

Once the Facebook social profile is linked to an user customer/contact record by the agent, subsequent Facebook conversations are linked to the customer records and the customer summary is populated.

If the customer is not identified based on name, a new contact record can be created.

Customer can send attachments only if you enable.  If you don't enable the option for the customers, they can send the file. However, agents won't receive the file and will see an error.

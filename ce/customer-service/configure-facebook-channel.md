# Configure a Facebook channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

You can integrate social messaging channels like Facebook Messenger with Omnichannel for Customer Service to engage with your customers. The asynchronous nature of the channel gives your customers the flexibility to reach out to your businesses when they find time to get their issues resolved.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be met before you configure the Facebook channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

- Create a Facebook page and enable Messenger. More information: [Create and Manage a Page and Messaging](https://www.facebook.com/help/994476827272050/?helpref=hc_fnav)
- Create a Facebook application. More information: [App Development](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/)
- Add Messenger and Webhooks to the Facebook application. More information: [Setting Up Your Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/app-setup/)
- If you'll use a test environment, set up test accounts in Facebook so that agents can send and receive messages in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

## Roles and permissions

The following Facebook roles and permissions are required for integrating your Facebook app with Omnichannel for Customer Service.

- Facebook users who don’t have a role in the Facebook app must have the `pages_messaging` permission to send messages to a Facebook page from Omnichannel for Customer Service. The app owner must provide the `pages_messaging` permission for users to be able to send messages. More information: [pages_messaging](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/pages_messaging/)

- If the Facebook app that you’re using is currently in development mode, then only those Facebook users who have roles within the app can send messages to the Facebook page; the messages can be received by or forwarded to Omnichannel for Customer Service. More information: [App roles](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-roles/)

- For Omnichannel for Customer Service to be able to retrieve the customer’s username from Facebook, the customer must request for Business Asset User Profile Access in their Facebook app. More information: [Business Asset User Profile Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/features-reference/business-asset-user-profile-access)

## Configure a Facebook channel

**To configure the Facebook channel account**

1. In Dynamics 365, go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.

   ### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)

    1. In the site map, in **Customer support**, select **Channels**.
    
    1. In **Accounts**, for **Messaging accounts**, select **Manage**.
   
   ### [Omnichannel admin center](#tab/omnichanneladmincenter) 

    - In the site map, in **General settings**, select **Channels**.

1. On the **Accounts and channels** page, select **New account**.

1. Enter the following details:
   1. On the **Channel details** page, enter a name and select Facebook in **Channels**.
   2. On the **Add account** page, specify the Facebook application ID and application secret. To get the application ID and application secret, go to your Facebook application, select **Settings** > **Basic**, and copy the value in the **App ID** and **App Secret** fields, respectively.
   3. On **Add Facebook Pages to this account**, do the following steps:
   4. Select **Add**, and in the **Add Facebook Page** pane, enter the following details:
      - **Page name:** Name of the Facebook page.
      - **Page ID:** ID of the Facebook page. To get the page ID, go to your Facebook page, select About, and copy the value in the Page ID field.
      - **Page access token:** Specify the Page access token of the Facebook application. To get the page access token, go to your Facebook application and then go to **Messenger** > **Settings**. In the **Access Tokens** section, select the page, and copy the value in the **Page Access Token** field.
   5. On the **Callback information** page, the **Callback URL** and **Verify token** fields are populated automatically when you save the settings. Use the information to configure webhooks in the Facebook application. The values for the fields will not be generated if the Facebook page is reused across multiple instances of the channel.

1. To configure routing and work distribution, you can [create a workstream](create-workstreams.md) or select an existing one.

1. Select the workstream that you've created for the Facebook channel and on the workstream page, select **Set up Facebook**, and do the following steps:
   1. In the **Available Facebook Pages** area, select a page from the list.
   2. On the **Language** page, select the language to use.
   3. On the **Behaviors** page, configure the following options:
      - Custom automated messages
      - [Post-conversation survey](configure-post-conversation-survey.md)
   4. On the **User features** page, configure the following options:
      - **File attachments:** When set to yes for both customer and agent, customers and agents can send and receive file attachments. More information: [Enable file attachments](enable-file-attachments.md). The availability and support of media is dependent on the Facebook application settings. More information: [Facebook updates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/europe-updates)
      - **Facebook message tag:** Set to **Yes** to enable your agents to message customers after 24 hours have passed. When set to **No**, agents will be unable to respond to customers after 24 hours unless the customer sends another message.

      If you enable the Facebook human agent message tag during an active conversation between the agent and customer, the agent must close the conversation and reopen it to communicate with customers after 24 hours of inactivity. Agents can start conversations with customers for up to seven days.

      To use the Facebook human agent message tag, you must also turn it on in the Facebook app. For more information, see [Facebook Developer Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/?id=2616212338594331).  
   5. Review the **Summary** page, and select **Create**. The channel instance is configured.

      If you enable the Facebook human agent message tag during an active conversation between the agent and customer, the agent must close the conversation and reopen it in order to communicate with customers after 24 hours of inactivity. Agents can start conversations with customers for up to seven days.
    
      To use the Facebook human agent message tag, you must also turn it on in the Facebook app. For more information, see [Facebook Developer Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/?id=2616212338594331).

3. On the **Automated messages** tab, [configure automated messages](configure-automated-message.md).

4. On the **Surveys** tab, [configure a post-conversation survey](configure-post-conversation-survey.md).

## Customer experience

A customer can start a conversation in any of the following ways:

- Messenger on the Facebook page
- [www.messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com/)
- Messenger app on a mobile device
- Messenger widget on a custom website

If a customer starts a conversation from the Facebook page and then later switches to the mobile device, the previous conversation persists, and the customer can continue the conversation.

The agent receives the notification of the incoming conversation request. More information: [Use Facebook channel](facebook.md)

After the Facebook social profile is linked to a customer or contact record by the agent, subsequent Facebook conversations are linked to the customer records and the customer summary is populated.

If the customer is not identified based on name, a new contact record can be created.

The customer can send attachments only if you enable them. When the option isn't enabled for the customers, they can still attempt to send the file. However, agents won't receive the file and will see an error.

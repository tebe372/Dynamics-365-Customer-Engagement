# Support for live chat and asynchronous channels

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Support for adaptive cards

The following table lists the rich cards that are supported across different channels when you're using bots. The support categories are intentionally broad because many possible combinations of cards, features, and channels are applicable. We recommend that you use the information in the table as a base reference, and test each of your cards in the required channels.

| Channel | Hero card | Thumbnail card | Sign in card |Audio card | CardCarousel |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|------------|----|
| Microsoft Teams  | ‚úî     |  ‚úî   | ‚úî  | ‚úñ  | ‚úî  |
| Facebook | ‚úî  |  ‚úî  | ‚úî | üåê  |  ‚úî| 
| LINE    | ‚úî | ‚úî   | ‚úî | üåê  | ‚úî|
| Custom (Telegram)  | ‚úî | ‚úî | ‚úî | üåê | ‚úî |
| Custom (Direct Line) | ‚úî |  ‚úî | ‚úî | ‚úî*  | ‚úî* |


‚úî: Supported; card is supported fully with the exception that some channels support a subset of the card actions. The number of actions allowed on each card might be limited that varies by channel.

‚ö†: Partial support; varies by channel; card might not be displayed at all if it contains inputs or buttons. 

‚úî* : Card elements are supported in the Webchat version of Custom (Direct Line), but not in the Android version.

‚úñ: No support.

üî∂: Card is converted to an image.

üåê: Card is converted to unformatted text, links might not be active, images might not be displayed, or media might not work. The behavior might vary by channel.

The markdown element for adaptive cards is partially supported across all chat channels. For example, the markdown element isn't supported in live chat, whereas, it's supported in LINE.

Media or audio card and date input elements for adaptive cards are only supported in Live chat channels. Adaptive card elements like text block and images are also supported across channels.

Other social channels, such as Twitter, SMS, WhatsApp, and WeChat don't support any cards listed in the preceding table.

> - For Microsoft Teams, when a customer sends an emoji from the Teams client, the agent receives a PNG image. When an agent sends a GIF image (outbound), the customer will receive a PNG image.
> - The Direct Line channel supports the above attachment types, but it's up to the client to implement them.

> - For WhatsApp messages, when a customer sends an attachment in document format (for example, a DOCX, XLSX, or TXT file), the agent will receive the attachment name as message text. We recommend converting documents to PDF format before sending them as attachments.

## Support for social profiles

Omnichannel for Customer Service creates a social profile for incoming requests from asynchronous channels. When a social profile is created for a conversation within a channel, later conversations will be linked to the same social profile for this channel.

With social profiles, you can do the following:

- [Automatically identify customers](record-identification-rule.md) on social channels
- Display the customer name or phone number with conversations on the agent dashboard
- Send outbound messages

| Channel            | Supported?                                                          | Visitor name|

| LINE               | Yes                                                                 | Display name |

## Preview: Support for formatted messages <a name="formatted-messages"></a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.

Agents can use basic formatting capabilities in their outbound messages across both asynchronous and live chat channels. However, for your agents to send and receive formatted messages, you must [enable formatted messages](enable-formatted-messages.md).

The following table lists the text styles supported by Microsoft Teams, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Direct Line-based channels.

| Style                | Live chat  | Microsoft Teams | Facebook | WhatsApp | Custom messaging (Telegram)| Custom messaging (Direct Line) |

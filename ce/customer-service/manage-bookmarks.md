# Create bookmarks to save personalized views of reports

[!INCLUDE[cc-early access](../includes/cc-early-access.md)]


The Microsoft Power BI bookmarks feature can be used to create and save custom views of the analytics reports as bookmarks in Customer Service workspace or Omnichannel for Customer Service. The bookmarks option will help you save multiple bookmarks, set a default bookmark, and select any of the saved filtered views to see the reports based on the context you've selected.

The bookmarks are available for Customer Service dashboards and Omnichannel for Customer Service dashboards only.

## Create and manage bookmarks

1. In Customer Service workspace or Omnichannel for Customer Service, select the plus sign (+) and then select **Customer Service historical analytics** or **Omnichannel historical analytics**.

1. On the report page, select a tab, such as Summary.

1. Use the filters to display data of your choice. For example, select the Agent filter and select the agent for whom you want to view the data.

1. Select **Bookmarks**, and then select **Create new bookmark**.

1. On the **Create report bookmark** dialog, enter a name in the **Bookmark name** field, and select **Save**.

1. Repeat the steps to create additional bookmarks for the different report views that you frequently need to access.

1. Select **Bookmarks** and then select **Manage bookmarks**. The **Bookmarks** flyout menu appears and displays the bookmarks that you've created.

1. To delete a bookmark, on the Bookmarks flyout menu, select the delete option for the bookmark that you want to remove.

1. Use the pin option to set a bookmark as the default view for the report.

1. To modify a bookmark view, select the bookmark, modify the filters to your requirement, and then select **Update bookmark** in the **Bookmarks** dropdown list.

# Create bookmarks for reports

[!INCLUDE[cc-early access](../includes/cc-early-access.md)]

Save personalized views of your reports in bookmarks. A bookmark captures the state of a report page, including changes that you've made to filters, slicers, and visuals. Use bookmark options to select a saved view, update or delete a bookmark, and set a default bookmark.

Bookmarks are available in historical analytics reports and knowledge analytics reports only.

## Create a bookmark
<!-- Please update the screenshots below with ones from the correct environment and change the option names in the instructions to match. The bookmark options I see in my environment are different from what's in your text.-->
1. In Customer Service workspace or Omnichannel for Customer Service, open one of the following reports:

    - **Customer Service historical analytics**
    - **Omnichannel historical analytics**
    - **Knowledge analytics**

1. On the report page, select a tab, such as **Summary**.

1. Adjust the report filters, slicers, and visuals as needed to customize your view of the data.

1. Select **Bookmarks**, and then select **Add a personal bookmark**.

1. Optionally, to always open the report with the current filters, slicers, and visuals, select **Make default view**.

1. Select **Save**.

## Manage bookmarks

<!-- I'm commenting these instructions out rather than deleting them in case my environment is waaaaaay different from yours, and your instructions reflect the way bookmarks work in this UI. I hope they work the way bookmarks work in Power BI.

Select **Bookmarks**, and then select **Manage bookmarks**.

- To delete a bookmark, select the delete icon.

- To set a bookmark as the default view for the report, select the pin icon.

To modify a saved view, adjust the report filters, slicers, and visuals as needed. Select **Bookmarks** > **Manage bookmarks**, and then select **Update bookmark**. -->

1. If your current view is a bookmark, select the bookmark name as shown in the example below. Otherwise, select **Bookmarks**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/bookmarks-modify.png" alt-text="Screenshot of bookmark options.":::

1. Select the **More options** (**...**) menu, and then select one of the following options:

    - **Update**: Save the bookmarked view with the same name if you've made changes to filters, slicers, or visuals.
    - **Make default**: Always open the report with the current filters, slicers, and visuals.
    - **Rename**: Give the bookmark a new name.
    - **Delete**: Delete the saved view and reset the report to its default filters, slicers, and visuals.

To undo changes you've made to a report without deleting your bookmark, select **Reset to default**.

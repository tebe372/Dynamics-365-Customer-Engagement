# Manage bookmarks for reports

A bookmark captures the state of a report page, including changes that you've made to the filters. Use bookmark options to select a saved view, update or delete a bookmark, and set a default bookmark. Personalize your reports and save the time and effort required to reapply the filters every time you view a report.

A bookmark that you create for a [report group](report-filters-groups.md) saves a personalized view using that group's filters. For example, if you create a bookmark in the Omnichannel historical report's **Conversation** tab, the bookmark applies to the **Conversation**, **Queue**, and **Agent** tabs, and doesn't include filters for the other tabs.

You can use bookmarks in all the out-of-the-box reports such as Customer Service historical analytics, Omnichannel historical analytics, Omnichannel real-time analytics, and knowledge analytics reports.

## Prerequisites

Grant **Create**, **Read**, **Write**, and **Delete** privileges to the security roles as applicable, for the **Report Bookmark** custom entity.

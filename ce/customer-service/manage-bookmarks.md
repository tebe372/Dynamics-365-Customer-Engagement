# Manage bookmarks for reports

[!INCLUDE[cc-early access](../includes/cc-early-access.md)]

Save personalized views of your reports in bookmarks. A bookmark captures the state of a report page, including changes that you've made to filters, slicers, and visuals. Use bookmark options to select a saved view, update or delete a bookmark, and set a default bookmark.

Bookmarks are available in historical analytics reports and knowledge analytics reports only.

    - **Customer Service historical analytics**
    - **Omnichannel historical analytics**
    - **Knowledge analytics**

1. On the report page, select a tab, such as **Summary**.

1. Adjust the report filters, slicers, and visuals as needed to customize your view of the data.

1. Select **Bookmarks**, and then select **Create new bookmark**.

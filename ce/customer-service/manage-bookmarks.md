# Create bookmarks to save personalized views of reports

[!INCLUDE[cc-early access](../includes/cc-early-access.md)]

Use bookmarks to create and save views of the historical analytics reports. A bookmark captures the state of a report page and includes the settings that you've made to filters, slicers, and visuals on the page. The bookmarks option will help you save multiple bookmarks, set a default bookmark, and select any of the saved views to see the reports based on the context you've selected.

The bookmarks are available for historical analytics and knowledge management analytics only.

## Create and manage bookmarks

1. In Customer Service workspace or Omnichannel for Customer Service, select the plus sign (+), and then select one of the following options:

    - **Customer Service historical analytics**
    - **Omnichannel historical analytics**
    - **Knowledge analytics**

1. On the report page, select a tab, such as **Summary**.

1. Use the filters to display data of your choice. For example, select the **Agent** filter and select the agent for whom you want to view the data.

1. Select **Bookmarks**, and then select **Create new bookmark**.

1. On the **Create report bookmark** dialog, enter a name in the **Bookmark name** field, and select **Save**.

1. Repeat the steps to create additional bookmarks for the different report views that you frequently need to access.

1. Select **Bookmarks** and then select **Manage bookmarks**. The **Bookmarks** flyout menu appears and displays the bookmarks that you've created.

1. To delete a bookmark, on the Bookmarks flyout menu, select the delete option for the bookmark that you want to remove.

1. Use the pin option to set a bookmark as the default view for the report.

1. To modify a bookmark view, select the bookmark, modify the filters as required, and then select **Update bookmark** in the **Bookmarks** dropdown list.

# Create and set up resources

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

A resource in service scheduling is anything that needs to be scheduled. This can be users, crews, service centers, company assets (equipment), accounts, or contacts.

## Set up bookable resources

[Set up bookable resources (Field Service)](../field-service/set-up-bookable-resources.md)

## Select resources for service  
 When you add a resource to a service, create a selection rule to determine how resources will be selected for service activities.  
  
 You can create a simple rule that selects resources from a list, or a compound rule that selects a combination of resources, or a complex tree of selection rules that selects from groups of equivalent resources.

## Add resources to existing services  
 You can add as many resources as you want, and they can be a mix of individual users, facilities, equipment, and teams. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set up or change a service](../customer-service/create-edit-service.md)

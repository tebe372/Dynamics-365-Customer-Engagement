# Overview of channels

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

As new social networks and communication channels rapidly evolve, so do customer expectations on how to reach their favorite brands. Communicating via many channels has become not only comfortable but expected, and businesses seeking to provide personalized services are rapidly working to enable support through the channels their customers want to use. 

Adding support channels to your businesses support offering is a powerful way to provide personalized service to customers on the channels of their choice. It is helpful to recognize a common pattern across all channels that are enabled through Omnichannel for Customer Service before diving into the implementation of a single channel. The implementation pattern for out-of-the-box channels is as follows:

- Establish your account and respective requirements (such as a page, and app) with the Channel provider. This ensures you have an entry point with the channel provider through which customers will engage.
- Configure the workstream in [Customer Service admin center](cs-admin-center.md).
- Configure the Channel in Customer Service admin center and attach it to the workstream.
- Populate the exchange of handshake data (token and secrets) required between Omnichannel and the channel provider. This is usually done in both places, the Customer Service admin center app and the channel provider experience. 

The following channels are currently available in Omnichannel for Customer Service:

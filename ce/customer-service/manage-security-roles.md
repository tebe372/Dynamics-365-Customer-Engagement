# Manage security roles in service scheduling

Security roles help to identify the privileges a user can exercise in the system. Security roles also define which entities a user can view or configure. For example, a user may have permission to see accounts but cannot see specific fields of an account.

The following standard security roles are leveraged in service scheduling:
  
- **Scheduler Manager**. This role can set up the service scheduling experience. This role can access and set up all service scheduling entities in the system:

   - Resources
   - Resource Categories
   - Facilites/Equipment
   - Services
   - Service Activities
   - Schedule Board
   - Organizational Units
   - Business Closure

   However, to ensure that all Scheduler Managers are able to set up the new scheduling experience and access the new scheduling entities, they should also be assigned the **Customer Service Schedule Administrator** and **Schedule Manager** roles.

   To learn more about how to create users and assign roles to them, see [Create users and assign security roles](../admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles.md). 

- **Scheduler**. This role can create and schedule service activities. 

  To ensure that all Scheduler users are able to schedule services using the new scheduling experience, they should also be assigned the **Customer Service Scheduler** and **Scheduler** roles.

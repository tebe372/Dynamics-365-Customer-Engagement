# Manage security roles in service scheduling

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]


A user in Customer Service is a member of your organization who will use a Service Scheduling license. Security roles help to identify the privileges a user can exercise in the system. Security roles also define which entities a user can view or configure. For example, a user may have permission to see accounts but not to see specific fields for an account.

The predefined roles in service scheduling are:
  
- **Customer Service Manager**. The Customer Service Manager role can setup the service scheduling experience. This role has access to all service scheduling entities.
- **Customer Service Representative**. The Customer Service Representative can create and schedule service activities.

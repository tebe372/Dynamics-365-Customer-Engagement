# Integrate a Power Virtual Agents bot for voice

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

To route customers call to the best department, diagnose issues, collect information, and give recommendations, conversational IVR bots speak to customers when they call in. Power Virtual Agents makes it easy to author IVR bots and you can use the same bots for other channels, like chat and voice.

Some of the features of the Power Virtual Agents bots for voice are as follows:

- Customizable voices in the Omnichannel for Customer Service configuration experience.
- Questions in Power Virtual Agents using "Boolean" types do not prompt users with "Options are _Yes_ or _No_".
- All bot messages can be interrupted by the caller.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be met for the Power Virtual Agents bot:

- The bot is published, and the **Agent transfers** setting is configured by selecting **Omnichannel**. More information: [Configure seamless and contextual hand-off to Omnichannel for Customer Service](/power-virtual-agents/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel)
- The **Enable voice** option is selected in the **Omnichannel** section of the **Agent transfers** setting.

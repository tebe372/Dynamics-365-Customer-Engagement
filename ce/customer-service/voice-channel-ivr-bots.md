## Introduction

Conversational IVR bots speak to customers when they call in to route their call to the best department, diagnose issues, collect information, and give recommendations. Power Virtual Agents makes it easy to author IVR bots and you can use the same bots for other channels, like chat and voice.

## Private Preview refresh - September '21

We are refreshing our Private Preview in September 2021 with the following updates. To get the following updates, you will need to be enrolled into the private preview program, and create a new bot after September 23, 2021. Any new bots created after this time will be using the new refresh code. Old bots using orivatepPreview will continue to work but will stop working by October 15, 2021. 

1. Improved latency and performance for voice interactions.
1. Customizable voices in the Omnichannel for Customer Service configuration experience.
1. Questions in Power Virtual Agents using "Boolean" types do not prompt users with "Options are _Yes_ or _No_".
1. All bot messages can be interrupted by the caller.

## Prerequisites

A bot is configured in Power Virtual Agents, published, and with the Transfer to Agent configured. More information: [Configure seamless and contextual hand-off to Omnichannel for Customer Service](/power-virtual-agents/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel)

You might need to sign into [Power Virtual Agents](https://powerva.microsoft.com/environments) and select the right environment. More information: [Create a bot in an existing environment](/power-virtual-agents/environments-first-run-experience#create-a-bot-in-an-existing-environment).

> [!IMPORTANT]

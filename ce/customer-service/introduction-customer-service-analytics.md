# Customer Service Analytics and Insights

Customer service managers and supervisors are responsible for managing the agents who work with customers to resolve every day queries. Customer support supervisors need to be able to know the key operational and customer experience metrics to provide quality support.

Supervisors can see trends in these metrics over a period of time to understand how agents and queues are performing, so that they can take corrective measures, provide appropriate guidance to agents, and improve the customer support experience.

As a supervisor, use this dashboard to perform the following tasks:  

- Monitor case volume across channels, queues, and agents.

- Monitor support quality across queues and agents.

> [!NOTE]
> Contact your system administrator for configuration errors or if you are unable to view the reports and dashboards.

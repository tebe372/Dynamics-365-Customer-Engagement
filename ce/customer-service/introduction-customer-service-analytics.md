### Important

If you are a customer who uses the Customer Service Insights standalone web application, your current working environment(s) will be terminated and inaccessible by December 8, 2021. You will no longer be able to use the standalone service after this date. The embedded Customer Service Insights features in the core applications will continue to be available and supported. For users who hold Customer Service Enterprise licenses, you will no longer be able to create new workspaces, but you'll retain access to existing ones. In the interim, the standalone app guide contains documentation for the web application.

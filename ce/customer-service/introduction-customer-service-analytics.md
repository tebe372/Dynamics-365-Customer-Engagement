# Customer Service analytics and insights

Customer service managers and supervisors are responsible for managing the agents who work with customers to resolve every day queries. Customer support supervisors need to be able to know the key operational and customer experience metrics to provide quality support.

Supervisors can see trends in these metrics over a period of time to understand how agents and queues are performing, so that they can take corrective measures, provide appropriate guidance to agents, and improve the customer support experience. In addition, with artificial intelligence (AI), Customer Service Insights reports gives you actionable insights into critical performance metrics, operational data, and emerging trends from your customer service system.

As a supervisor, use analytics and insights to perform the following tasks:  

- Monitor case volume across channels, queues, and agents.
- Monitor support quality across queues and agents.
- Use AI-generated topics, which automatically group similar cases, to discover and adapt to current and emerging trends, improve brand sentiment, and identify problem areas.

> [!NOTE]
> Contact your system administrator for configuration errors or if you are unable to view the reports and dashboards.

# Customize live chat widget using Omnichannel Chat SDK

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Using the Omnichannel Chat SDK, you can create and customize chat widgets for use in mobile apps. The open-source Omnichannel Chat SDK comes with a fully customizable user interface with Omnichannel chat methods and features. The SDK is supported on React Native, and therefore works on iOS and Android apps, as well as on web browsers.

Examples of sample apps in the Omnichannel Chat SDK include:

- React-Native App: [gifted-chat](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat)

- Web Reference App: [BotFramework-WebChat](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat)

To view all sample apps, go to [Chat SDK Sample Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/omnichannel-chat-sdk/tree/main/samples).

This topic explains how you can use the Omnichannel Chat SDK to customize the live chat widget for mobile apps.

### Machine learning-based skill identification ruleset

To configure skill identification ruleset using the machine learning option, you must have configured the intelligent skill finder models. More information: [Set up intelligent skill finder model](intelligent-skill-model.md)

*Procedure to create ruleset using ML*
1.	For a work stream, from a routing rule section select ‘Create ruleset’ and then select ‘Create New’
2.	Choose Rule Type as Machine learning model and provide a name and description to the ruleset and select one of the AI Builder published text classification model and select Create
3.	In the input attributes section, select the attributes from the conversation entity or related entity. For an incoming work item, these attribute values will be concatenated and send to the Machine learning model for skill prediction
4.	In the output attributes section, Skill will be preselected which can not be edited or deleted.

## Enable skill-based routing<a name="sbr-oc-admin"></a>

To use skill-based routing, as an administrator, you must enable skill-based routing. You can enable the setting in the Omnichannel admin center, Omnichannel Administration, or Customer Service Hub app.

To enable skill-based routing, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the app.

2. Do one of the following depending on which app you're using:
   - In Omnichannel admin center, in the site map, Select **Skill Based Routing** under **Settings** in the sitemap.

3. On the **Skill Based Routing** tab, set the **Enable Skill Based Routing** toggle to **Yes**.

4. Select a rating model from the list for the **Rating Model** field.
 
    If there is no rating model, create a rating model. To learn more, see [Create rating model](enable-skill-routing-create-rating-model.md#create-rating-model).

    After you select a rating model, the **Rating Model Details** section displays the **Name**, **Min Rating Value**, **Max Rating Value** and the **Rating Values (Rating Model)** grid.

    Use the following steps to add a rating value in the grid:

    1. Select **New Rating Value**. The **Quick Create: Rating Value** pane appears.

    2. Specify a name and value.

    3. Select **Save and Close** to save and add the rating value.

5. Select **Save**.

## Rating value of skills

When you add a skill to an agent, you also need to rate the proficiency of the skill. This enables the system to do an exact or closest match against the requirement of a conversation and distribute the conversation accordingly. You can use the default rating model, edit it, or create a new one to match the needs of your organization.

You must provide the minimum and maximum rating value. Also, in the **Rating Values** section, you must create rating value text against each score between the minimum and maximum rating value. This text appears while updating an agent's skill and proficiency.

### Create rating model

1. Sign in to the Omnichannel Administration app.

2. Select **Skill Based Routing** under **Settings** in the sitemap.

3. Select **New Rating Model** in the **Rating Model** section. The **New Rating Model** page appears.

4. Specify the following in the **New Rating Model** page.

    | Tab | Field | Description | Example value  |
    |------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | General | Name | Specify a name for the rating model. | Language rating model |
    | General | Min Rating Value | Provide a minimum rating value. | 1 |
    | General | Max Rating Value | Provide a maximum rating value. | 10 |

5. Select **Save** to save the rating model. After you save, the **Rating Values** section appears.

6. Select **New Rating Value**. The **Quick Create: Rating Value** pane appears.

7. Specify the following in the **Rating Value** page.

    | Field | Description | Value  |
    |-----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | Name | Specify a name for the rating value. | ★★★★★★★★★★ <br> **Note:** <br>This is an example value.|
    | Value | Provide a value. | 10 <br> **Note:** <br>This is an example value.|

8. Select **Save and Close** to save and add the rating value to the grid.

9. Select **+ New** to add other rating values and repeat step 7 and 8.

10. Select **Save** to save the rating model changes.

### Recommended proficiency level

We recommend that you use a rating model with minimum value as 1 and maximum value as 10, and define the rating values accordingly.

For example:

| Rating value name | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| ★★★★★★★★★★| 10 star|
| ★★★★★★★★★ | 9 star|
| ★★★★★★★★ | 8 star|
| ★★★★★★★ | 7 star |
| ★★★★★★ | 6 star|
| ★★★★★ | 5 star|
| ★★★★ | 4 star|
| ★★★ | 3 star|
| ★★ | 2 star|
| ★ | 1 star|

# Customize knowledge article search filters

For the knowledge search results, you can configure standard and custom fields as filters to help your agents find the content and improve their productivity.

The fields that are present on the knowledge article entity are the fields that are available as filters. Additionally, filters can be defined on fields that have the following data types:

- Options set
- Multiselect options set
- Lookup
- Two choices
- Date and time

 Any filter configurations that you set will be available wherever the knowledge search experience is configured, such as the form-based knowledge control, knowledge search page, productivity pane-based knowledge search control, embedded search control in Unified Service Desk, and the application tab search experience in Customer Service workspace.

If you choose to retain the knowledge search filters, the web client and maker experience knowledge management filter experience are deactivated. In full-text search, the archived and discarded status filters are not supported.

## Knowledge article search filters are enabled by default (preview)
 
[!INCLUDE[cc-early-access](../includes/cc-early-access.md)]

The option to **Enable knowledge article search filters** is set to **Yes** by default. To disable search filters, you'll need to manually change the **Enable knowledge article search filters** option to **No** on the **Filters** page.

The settings that you have previously configured for your organization, including those within filter personalization, remain as is. Enabling or disabling filter customizations only impact filter personalization and not the settings within it, such as adding or modifying a filter type.

If you choose to proceed with customizing the search filters for your knowledge articles, you can do so with the options available on the **Filters** page. More information: [Customize search filters for knowledge articles](#customize-search-filters-for-knowledge-articles).

4. Select **Save**.

## Configure fields with data type as lookup as filters

Some configurable filter values may include lookup types, where there are numerous value options that can be set. Some examples of these filters are Created by, Modified by, and Owner.

## Deactivate or reactivate a filter configuration

There may be times when you want to temporarily suspend a filter configuration but donâ€™t want to lose the configuration settings. You can deactivate a filter configuration and then reactivate it later on.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you deactivate or delete all of the filters, then agents will see the following message on the personalization page: "No filters have been configured. Contact your administrator."

Keep in mind the following:
- If you delete a knowledge article field for which a filter has been created, your agents won't see the filter, and they won't be notified about the change in the UI. You, as the administrator, will see the filter with a message indicating that it has been deleted.

- If you deactivate the filter, it will show as deactivated to you as the administrator, but your agents won't see the filter on the knowledge control. When the filter is activated again, the filter configuration will remain as it was previously configured.

- If an agent doesnâ€™t have permission to see a specific field because of field-level security, then a filter created on that field won't be visible to the agent.

- Filters that are available in the default, out-of-the-box configuration can't be deleted.

- If an agent sets default values, those values will persist and cannot be overwritten by changes made by an administrator.
 
You can deactivate or reactivate a filter configuration in the Customer Service admin center or Customer Service Hub app by performing the following steps:

1. Go to the **Filters** page.

### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)

1. In the site map, select **Knowledge** in **Agent experience**. The **Knowledge** page appears.
1. On the **Knowledge** page, go to the **Filters** section and select **Manage**. The **Filters** page appears.

### [Customer Service Hub](#tab/customerservicehub)

  * In the site map, go to **Service Management**, and select **Filters** in **Knowledge Base Management**. The **Filters** page appears.

---

2. Select the ellipsis in the top-right corner for the filter you want to deactivate, and then select **Deactivate**.
3. Select **Done** > **Save**.
4. When you are ready to reactivate the filter, go to the **Filters** page, select the ellipsis next to the value you want to reactivate, and then select **Activate**. 
   All of the previous configurations will be reinstated.

## Allow agents to personalize their knowledge article search filters

You may have scenarios within your organization where agents are working on different areas and donâ€™t all need the same filter settings. For example, an organization may have agents working on different product areas. One agent might need to see knowledge articles for Product A, while another agent might only want knowledge articles for Product B, and so forth. You can allow your agents to personalize the knowledge article search filters for their areas.

You can allow agents to personalize their knowledge article search filters in the Customer Service admin center or Customer Service Hub app by performing the following steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** page.

### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)

  1. In the site map, select **Knowledge** in **Agent experience**. The **Knowledge** page appears.
  1. In the **General settings** section, select **Manage**. The **General settings** page appears.

### [Customer Service Hub](#tab/customerservicehub)

   * In the site map, go to **Service Management** and select **Settings** in **Knowledge Base Management**. The **Settings** page appears.

---
3. Customize the filter according to your needs by selecting or deselecting the values displayed and then turn on the **Set as a preselected filter** toggle if you want the filter to be shown to the agent by default. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > This option will be available only if **Enable custom filters** is set to **Yes**.

1. Select **Save**.

Once you have enabled the option to personalize the knowledge search filters for your agents, your agents will be able to view all the configurations that you have previously set for them.

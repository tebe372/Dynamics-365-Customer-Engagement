# Handle call overflow for the voice queues

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

As an administrator, you can determine the actions when an incoming call reaches the voice queue in the following situations:

- Exceeds a defined number of calls that are waiting in the queue
- Is received during the after hours of the call center operations

When both the conditions are defined, when one of them is met, the overflow actions configured at the workstream level will be run.

## Prerequisites

For call overflow to work correctly, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Agents should be configured for the voice queues.
- To transfer calls to an external phone number, phone numbers should be available.

## Configure call overflow

**To configure call overflow**

1. In Dynamics 365, go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.

   ### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)
       

    1. In the site map, select **Queues** in **Customer support**.
    
    2. On the **Queues** page, select **Manage** for **Advanced queues**.

   ### [Omnichannel admin center](#tab/omnichanneladmincenter)

    - In the site map, select **Queues** in **General settings**.

1. Select the voice queue for which you want to configure call overflow.

1. In **Overflow conditions**, select **Set overflow conditions**. The **Overflow conditions** panel appears.

1. In **Work item limit**, enter a number to denote the maximum number of calls that can be in waiting before overflow is reached. For example, if you enter 5 as the value, then five calls should be waiting in the queue for the sixth call to trigger call overflow.

1. If an operating hour record is configured for the queue, the toggle for **Out of operation hours**, is set to **On** by default and can't be edited. The call overflow is triggered when a call reaches the queue during the after hours of the call center operations. If no operating hour record is configured, the toggle will be set to **Off** and in the disabled mode. In such a case, the call center is considered to be available round the clock.

To remove the overflow setting, you'll need to set the work item limit to zero and remove the operating hour record on the queue if configured.

## Define operation hours

Perform the steps in [Create and manage operating hours](create-operating-hours.md) to configure operating hours for the voice queues.

If operation hours are not configured, the queues will be available round the clock.

## Configure overflow action in the voice workstream

Configure the action to be performed when call overflow is triggered. The following options are available to handle overflow actions for a voice workstream:

 -	**Default**: The work item remains in the queue to be routed to the next available agent.
 -	**End call**: The call ends if no agent is available to take the call. For example, an operating hour is configured, and the overflow action was triggered on account of it.
 -	**Transfer to external number**: The call is routed to a specified number if the work item must be handled on priority.

## Configuration considerations

Some configuration considerations are discussed in this section.

### Edit automated messages for end call overflow action

If you have set **End the call** as an overflow action, an automated message will be delivered to the customer to notify them that the conversation will end. You can edit the message that the customer will hear.

**To edit the automated message**

1. In the Omnichannel admin center site map, go to **Customer settings** in **Advanced settings**, and select **Automated messages**.
2. Find the automated message for the **Voice** channel where the message trigger is "Voice call ended".
3. Edit the value in the **Localized text** column as needed.

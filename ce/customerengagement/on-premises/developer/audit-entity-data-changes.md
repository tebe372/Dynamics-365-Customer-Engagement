# Audit entity data changes

Organizations need to track changes made to business data for maintaining security, examining the history of a particular data record, 
documenting modifications for future analysis and record keeping, and being in compliance with regulations. 
Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) support auditing of entity and attribute data changes on a per organization basis.  
  
## Overview

Organizations often need to be in compliance with various regulations to ensure availability of customer interaction history, audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking reports. Organizations may want to track changes in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) data for security and analytical purpose. To learn more, see  [Auditing Feature Overview](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/auditing-overview) in the Common Data Service documentation.

## Configure entities and attributes for auditing

There are three levels where auditing can be configured: organization, entity, and attribute. The organization level is the highest level, followed by the entity level, and finally the attribute level. For attribute auditing to take place, auditing must be enabled at the attribute, entity, and organization levels. For entity auditing to take place, auditing must be enabled at the entity and organization levels. To learn more, see [Configure Entities and Attributes for Auditing](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/configure-entities-attributes-auditing) in the Common Data Service documentation. 
  
## Retrieve and delete history of audited data changes

After auditing is enabled and data changes are made to those entities and attributes being audited, you can proceed to obtain the data change history. Optionally, you can delete the audit records after you review the change history. To learn more, see [Retrieve and Delete the History of Audited Data Changes](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/retrieve-and-delete-the-history-of-audited-data-changes) in the Common Data Service documentation.

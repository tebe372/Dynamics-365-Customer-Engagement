# Azure extensions for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)

[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] supports integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)]. Developers can register plug-ins with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) that can pass run-time message data, known as the execution context, to one or more [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] solutions in the cloud. This is especially important for [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] because [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] is one of two supported solutions for communicating run-time context obtained in a plug-in to external line-of-business (LOB) applications. The other solution is the external custom endpoint access capability from a plug-in registered in the sandbox.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[windows_azure_service_bus](../includes/windows-azure-service-bus.md)] provides a secure communication channel for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) run-time data to external line of business applications. This capability is especially useful in keeping disparate Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) system or other [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] server synchronized with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) business data changes.

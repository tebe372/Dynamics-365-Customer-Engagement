# Client scripting reference in Customer Engagement using JavaScript

This section contains reference documentation for client API object model that can be used with JavaScript libraries. 

This is supplemental to the comprehensive [Client API reference docs](/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference) available in Power Apps docs; all the client APIs documented in Power Apps docs are also applicable for the on-premises customers unless specified otherwise. 

To see the list of client API methods and properties that are only supported  for on-premises environment, see [Client API methods not supported in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)](clientapis-not-supported-for-onpremises.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The Client API object model also contains the **Xrm.Internal** namespace, and use of the objects/methods in this namespace isn’t supported. These objects, and any parts of the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), are subject to change without notice. We recommend that you don’t use these functions or any script that depends on the DOM.
> - Also, while debugging, you may find methods and objects in the Client API object model that aren’t documented. Only documented objects and methods are supported.

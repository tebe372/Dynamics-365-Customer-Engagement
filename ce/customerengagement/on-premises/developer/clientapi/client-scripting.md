# Client scripting in Customer Engagement using JavaScript

Client-side scripting using JavaScript is one of the ways to apply custom business process logic for displaying data on a form in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). Forms in Customer Engagement (on-premises) help display data to the user. A form in a Customer Engagement app can contain items such as fields, a quick form, or a grid.

You can also use business rules, which provides a way for someone, who does not know JavaScript and is not a developer, to apply business process logic in a form. More information: [Create business rules and recommendations to apply logic in a form](../../customize/create-business-rules-recommendations-apply-logic-form.md)

Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) provide you a rich set of **client APIs** to interact with form objects and events to control what and when to display on a form.

> [!IMPORTANT]

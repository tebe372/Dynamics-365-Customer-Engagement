# Sample: Specify a queue item to work on (early bound)

This sample shows how to use [PickFromQueueRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.pickfromqueuerequest?view=dynamics-general-ce-9) to specify a user who will work on a queue item. You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/SpecifyQueueItem).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](includes/cc-how-to-run-PA-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The `PickFromQueueRequest` message is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains data that is needed to assign a queue item to a user and optionally remove the queue item from the queue.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the current version of the org.
2. The `Queue` method creates a private queue instance and set its property values.
3. The `QueueItem` method creates a new instance of queueitem and initialize its properties.

### Demonstrate

1. The `WhoAmIRequest` method retrieves the current user information.
1. The `PickFromQueueRequest` method creates an instance of an existing queueitem in order to specify the user that will be working on it.


### Clean up

Display an option to delete the sample data that is created in [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.

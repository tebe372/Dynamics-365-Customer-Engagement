# Supported entities for asynchronous operations

The entities and messages that are supported in asynchronous operations are the same as the message and entity combinations that support plug-ins. For more information, see [Supported Messages and Entities for Plug-ins](supported-messages-entities-plugin.md).  
  
 Asynchronous operations are spawned to handle many types of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) operations, for example import/export, bulk operations, duplicate detection, recurring appointments, recurring (internal) system jobs, and more.

# Sample: One-way listener

This sample listener application registers a remote service plug-in that executes whenever a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) message is posted to a one-way endpoint on the [!INCLUDE[windows_azure_service_bus](../includes/windows-azure-service-bus.md)]. When the plug-in executes, it outputs to the console the contents of the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) execution context contained in the message.

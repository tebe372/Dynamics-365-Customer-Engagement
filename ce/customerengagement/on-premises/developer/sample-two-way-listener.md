# Sample: Two-way listener

This sample registers a remote service plug-in that executes whenever a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) message is posted to a two-way endpoint on the [!INCLUDE[windows_azure_service_bus](../includes/windows-azure-service-bus.md)]. When the plug-in executes, it prints to the console the contents of the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) execution context contained in the message.

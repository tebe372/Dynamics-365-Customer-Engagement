# Use Postman to perform operations with the Web API

The environment created by using the instructions in [Set up a Postman environment](setup-postman-environment.md) creates a `{{webapiurl}}` Postman variable that provides the base URL for requests. Append to this variable to define the URL for your requests.

The operations that you can perform using the Web API are same for the online and on-premises deployments of Customer Engagement. For complete documentation on how to perform various Web API operations using Postman, see this topic in the Power Apps documentation: [Use Postman to perform operations](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/use-postman-perform-operations).

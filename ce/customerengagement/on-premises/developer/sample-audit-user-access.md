# Sample: Audit user access

This sample code is for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)]. [Download the code samples of audit entity data changes and audit user access](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/samples-from-msdn/Auditing).  

## Prerequisites
[!INCLUDE[sdk-prerequisite](../includes/sdk-prerequisite.md)]
  
## Requirements  
 [!INCLUDE[sdk_SeeConnectionHelper](../includes/sdk-seeconnectionhelper.md)] This sample requires the logged on user to have the System Administrator role for enabling auditing on an organization.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 This sample demonstrates how to audit user access to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].  
  
## Example  
 The sample first enables user access auditing with the logged on userâ€™s organization. Next, it creates and modifies an account entity so that audit records are generated. Finally, the sample displays the audited information.

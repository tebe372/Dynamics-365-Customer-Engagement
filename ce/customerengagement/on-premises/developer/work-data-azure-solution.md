# Work with Customer Engagement data in your Azure solution

An internal plug-in named ServiceBusPlugin is provided with [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)]. The plug-in contains the business logic to post the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) message execution context to the [!INCLUDE[windows_azure_service_bus](../includes/windows-azure-service-bus.md)]. To use this plug-in, you need to register a [!INCLUDE[windows_azure_service_bus](../includes/windows-azure-service-bus.md)] solution endpoint and a step for the plug-in. The step defines what message and entity combination being processed by the core Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) operation should trigger the plug-in to execute. The ServiceBusPlugin can only be registered to run asynchronously. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Register an Azure-aware Plug-in using the Plug-in Registration Tool](walkthrough-register-azure-aware-plug-in-using-plug-in-registration-tool.md).  
  
 In addition, you can write a custom plug-in that includes the required lines of code to post to the service bus. The plug-in is registered in a similar way, except that it must be registered in the sandbox and run under partial trust. For more information on writing a custom plug-in that can post to the [!INCLUDE[windows_azure_service_bus](../includes/windows-azure-service-bus.md)], see [Write a Custom Azure-aware Plug-in](write-custom-azure-aware-plugin.md).  
  
 You can also write a custom workflow activity that can post the execution context to the service bus and include this activity in your workflows. Sample code for a custom [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)]-aware workflow activity is provided in the topic [Sample: Azure Aware Custom Workflow Activity](sample-azure-aware-custom-workflow-activity.md).

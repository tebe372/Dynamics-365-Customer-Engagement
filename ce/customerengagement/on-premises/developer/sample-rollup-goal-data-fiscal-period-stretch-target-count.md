## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](includes/cc-how-to-run-PA-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

This sample shows how to roll up goal data for a fiscal period against stretch target count representing a number of completed telephone calls.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the version of the org.
2. Retrieves the sales manager and 2 sales representatives, created manually in **Office 365**.
3. Creates a `PhoneCall` record and supporting account record for the sample.
4. Creates ActivityPartys for the phone calls **From** field.
5. Creates an open phone call.
6. Closes the first phone call and creates a second one.
7. Closes the second phone call.

### Demonstrate

1. Creates Metric, and setting the Metric type to **count** and enabling stretch tracking.
2. Creates a rollup field which targets completed (received) phone calls.
3. The `GoalRollupQuery` creates the goal rollup queries, locating the incoming and outgoing closed phone calls. 
4. Creates three goals, one parent goal and two child goals.
5. The `RecalculateRequest` calculates the rollup for goals. 

### Clean up

Display an option to delete the sample data created in [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.

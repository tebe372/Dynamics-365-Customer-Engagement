# Sample: REST listener

This sample code is for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)]. Download the sample: [Work with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) and Azure Integration](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/samples-from-msdn/Azure)
  
## Requirements  
 You must configure Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] prior to registering and executing this sample activity.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 This sample shows how to write a [!INCLUDE[windows_azure_service_bus](../includes/windows-azure-service-bus.md)] Listener for a REST endpoint contract.  
  
 This sample registers a remote service plug-in that executes whenever a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) message is posted to a REST endpoint on the service bus. When the plug-in executes, it prints to the console the contents of the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) execution context contained in the message.

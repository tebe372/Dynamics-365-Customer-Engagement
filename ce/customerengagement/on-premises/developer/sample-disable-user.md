# Sample: Disable a user

This sample shows how to disable and enable a system user account in an online or on-premise/IFD environment. Download the complete sample from [Sample: Disable a User](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/DisableOrEnableUser).

[!INCLUDE[cc-sample-note](./includes/cc-sample-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE[sdk-prerequisite](../includes/sdk-prerequisite.md)]

The Customer Engagement user account under which you run this program must have the System Administrator role in order to enable/disable a system user.

Before building this sample, open the solution in Visual Studio and select **View** > **Task List**. There are two TODO comments that you must follow to provide the required information about an existing system user in your organization.
  
## Requirements

See [How to run samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/cds/README.md) for information about how to run this sample.
  
## Demonstrates  

Demonstrates using <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.SetStateRequest> to disable and enable a system user. Also shows how to retrieve information about a system user.

To view the summary of the specified system user in Customer Engagement, navigate to **Settings** > **Security** > **Users** and select the target system user account in the list. If desired, choose the **Disabled Users** system view to filter the list of all users. The user's status should be "Disabled".

1. Download or clone the  [Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples) repo so that you have a local copy.
1. (Optional) Edit the cds/App.config file to define a connection string specifying the instance/org you want to connect to.
1. Open the sample solution in Visual Studio and press **F5** to run the sample. After you specify a connection string in cds/App.config, any sample you run will use that connection information.

If you do not specify a connection string in cds/App.config file, a dialog will open each time you run the sample and you will need to enter information about which instance/org you want to connect to and which credentials you want to use. This dialog will cache previous connections so that you can choose a previously used connection.

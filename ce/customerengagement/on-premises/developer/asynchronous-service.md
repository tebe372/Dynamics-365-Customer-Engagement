# Asynchronous service in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement

The asynchronous service executes long-running operations independent of the main 
[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] core operation. 
This results in improved overall system performance and improved scalability. The asynchronous service features a managed queue for the execution of 
asynchronous registered plug-ins, workflows, and operations such as bulk mail, bulk import, and campaign activity propagation. These operations are 
registered with the asynchronous service and executed periodically when the service processes its queue. The asynchronous service can be hosted on a 
server other that the server running Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).

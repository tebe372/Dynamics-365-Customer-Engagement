# Sample: Persistent queue listener

This sample code is for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)]. Download the sample: [Work with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement and Azure Integration](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/samples-from-msdn/Azure) 
  
## Requirements  
 This sample code requires the following additional [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] project reference: **Microsoft.ServiceBus**. The Microsoft.ServiceBus.dll assembly can be found in the [Microsoft Azure SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/archive-net-downloads/).  
  
## Demonstrates  
 This sample shows how to write a [!INCLUDE[windows_azure_service_bus](../includes/windows-azure-service-bus.md)] listener application for a persistent queue endpoint contract.  
  
 The listener waits for a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) message to be posted to the service bus and to be available in the endpoint queue. When a message is available in the queue, the listener reads the message, prints the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) execution context contained in the message to the console, and deletes the message from the queue.

# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Help, version 9

Welcome to the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) Help!

Effective October 2019, the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement SKU/license plan is no longer available for "online" customers. More information: [Dynamics 365 Licensing Update](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/licensing/update)

With this change for *online* customers, we are no longer using the term "Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps" to refer to the collection of following apps and its related services:
- Dynamics 365 Sales
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service
- Dynamics 365 Marketing 
- Dynamics 365 Field Service
- Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation

For *online* customers, these apps are model-driven apps running on [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro). You can build model-driven apps using Power Apps. More information: [What are model-driven apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview)

For *on-premises* customers, "Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises)" is the official name of the product that provides sales, service, and marketing features. Customer Engagement (on-premises) shares many features in common with Common Data Service and Power Apps. 

To avoid duplicating the common information between Customer Engagement (on-premises) and Power Apps/Common Data Service documentation, you will find a lot of references and links from this guide pointing to the Common Data Service and Power Apps documentation.  

## Documentation for previous version

Documentation for previous version (8.x and earlier) is available here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dynamics/>.

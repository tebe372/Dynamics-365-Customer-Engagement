# Report writing guide for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), version 9

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) includes reports, charts, and dashboards that provide useful business information and visualizations to the user.  

> [!NOTE]
> This guide is also applicable for Common Data Service. You can follow the information in this guide to create and edit fetch-based reports that can run in Common Data Service. The following reporting topics are available in the Common Data Service documentation:
> - [Add reporting to your model-driven app](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/add-reporting-to-app) 
> - [Create a report using the Report Wizard](/powerapps/user/create-report-with-wizard)
> - [Work with reports](/powerapps/user/work-with-reports)

  
 ## Paginated reports  
  
Customer Engagement (on-premises) includes a Report Wizard that can be used to easily create reports in just a few steps without using XML or [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL-based](../includes/pn-sql-based.md)] queries. For more information about the Report Wizard, see [Create, edit, or copy a report using the Report Wizard](../basics/create-edit-copy-report-wizard.md).  
  
 However, to create more complex reports, you can either create your own custom reports from scratch, or use an existing report as a template. The topics in this guide show you how to create new reports or change existing reports using [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio](../includes/pn-visual-studio.md)] as the report writing tool and [!INCLUDE[pn_SQL_Server_Reporting](../includes/pn-sql-server-reporting.md)] as the report engine.  
  
 ## Dashboards  
  
 There are two types of dashboards in Customer Engagement (on-premises)â€”user dashboards and system dashboards. Any user can create a dashboard visible only to them in their work area, such as Sales, Service, or Marketing.  An administrator or customizer creates or customizes system dashboards that, when published, are visible to everyone in the organization. A user can choose to set their user dashboard as their default dashboard and override the system dashboard.

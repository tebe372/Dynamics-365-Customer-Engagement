> The customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation) run on [Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro), which is also the underlying data platform for Power Apps. Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) customizers can continue to create and customize apps for the Customer Engagement platform, which has similar functionality as Dataverse. <br />
> The documentation that is applicable to Dynamics 365 for the customer engagement apps makers and customizers is available in the Power Apps documentation at: [What are model-driven apps in Power Apps?](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview) and [What is Dataverse?](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) <br />
> This topic and its sub-topics contain information that is applicable only for the on-premises app makers and customizers of the customer engagement apps.

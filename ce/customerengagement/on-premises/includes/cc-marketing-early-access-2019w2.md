> This is an early access feature, which means that it's currently available only on opted-in instances. You can opt in for early access on any instance, but we recommend that you do so only on trial, test, or sandbox instances, which will give you a chance to learn the new functionality before it shows up on your production instances later this year.
> 
> For instructions on how to opt in and enable early access, see [Enable the 2019 release wave 2 updates for Dynamics 365 for Marketing](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/preview-october-2019-updates#enable-the-2019-release-wave-2-updates-for-dynamics-365-for-marketing).

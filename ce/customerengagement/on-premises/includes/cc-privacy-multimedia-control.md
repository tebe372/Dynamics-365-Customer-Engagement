When you add the Multimedia Control to a form, certain identifiable device information (the device name – such as iPhone, the OS and the OS version, the browser and the browser version) will be sent to the service that you are calling (such as YouTube or Azure Media Services) and will be subject to the terms of that service’s privacy statement. By adding this control, you agree for this limited set of data to be sent to the external service you are calling. Note that you may remove the control at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.

# Set up SharePoint integration

With Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), you can use the document management capabilities of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] from within Customer Engagement (on-premises). You can store and manage documents in the context of a [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] record on a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], and leverage the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] infrastructure to share, manage, and collaborate efficiently. Because the documents are stored on a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], non-Customer Engagement (on-premises) users can directly access the documents on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], provided they have the appropriate permissions.  
  
 For document management functionality, you enable server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration (recommended) on a site collection in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. Server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] provides the following benefits.  
  
- Users sign-in once and do not have to sign-in to both Customer Engagement (on-premises) and [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  
  
- No additional software is required to install on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] documents will display in Customer Engagement (on-premises) lists.  
  
- Users can perform [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] actions from the Customer Engagement (on-premises) command bar.

# Add teams or users to a field security profile to control access

Role-based security controls access to a specific entity type, record-based security controls access to individual records, and field-level security controls access to specific fields. You can use a field security profile to manage the permission of users and teams to read, create, or write in secured fields. For example, the System Administrator field security profile gives full access to all secured fields in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_security](../includes/proc-settings-security.md)]  
  
2. Choose **Field Security Profiles**.  
  
3. Choose the profile name that you want to add teams or users to.  
  
4. Under Related, choose **Teams** or **Users**.  
  
5. On the Actions toolbar, choose **Add**.  
  
6. Select a team or user from the list. You can search for a team or user first.  
  
7. Choose **Add**.  
  
8. Close the field security profile record.

# Remove a large amount of specific, targeted data with bulk deletion 

The *bulk deletion* feature helps you to maintain data quality and manage the consumption of system storage in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) by deleting data that you no longer need.  
  
 For example, you can delete the following data in bulk:  
  
-   Stale data.  
  
-   Data that is irrelevant to the business.  
  
-   Unneeded test or sample data.  
  
-   Data that is incorrectly imported from other systems.  
  
With bulk deletion you can perform the following operations:  
  
-   Delete data across multiple entities.  
  
-   Delete records for a specified entity.  
  
-   Receive email notifications when a bulk deletion finishes.  
  
-   Delete data periodically.  
  
-   Schedule the start time of a recurring bulk delete.  
  
-   Retrieve the information about the failures that occurred during a bulk deletion.  
  
## Delete bulk data 
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_datamanagement](../includes/proc-settings-datamanagement.md)]  
  
2. Choose **Bulk Record Deletion**.  
  
3. Choose **New** to run the **Bulk Deletion Wizard** to create a bulk deletion job with the records you want to delete.  
  
For information about how to implement bulk delete in code, see [Delete data in bulk](../developer/delete-data-bulk.md).

# Connect Gmail accounts by using OAuth 2.0 

Follow the steps in this article to set up server-side synchronization to send and receive email in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) from Gmail accounts by using OAuth 2.0 as the authorization mechanism.

> [!NOTE]
> The Gmail OAuth email server profile requires version 9.1 or later and works for up to 100 users. Create multiple OAuth profiles (steps 1 through 4) if you want to associate the same profile with multiple users.

## Step 1. Enable IMAP or POP in Gmail

> [!NOTE]
> These steps should be done by the system administrator.

For IMAP, follow the steps in [Check Gmail through other email platforms](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229).

For POP, follow the steps in [Read Gmail messages on other email clients using POP](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7104828).

## Step 2. Create a project

> [!NOTE]
> These steps should be done by the system administrator.

Using a Google account (this can be the same one you'll use to send and retrieve email, or a different one), go to the Google Developers Console and create a new project.

Follow the steps for **Create a project** in [Create, shut down, and restore projects](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6251787).

## Step 3. Configure OAuth consent

> These steps should be done by the system administrator.

1. Select **OAuth consent screen**, and then select the user type:
   - Select **Internal** if you're using a GSuite admin tenant and will be creating the app exclusively for your organization.

2. Select **Create**.

3. Under **Application name**, enter the application name. Under **Authorized domains**, enter your environment's top private domain name (for example, `dynamics.com`). Select **Save**.

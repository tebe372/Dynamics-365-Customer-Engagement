# Update an organization



When you update the organizations in your deployment, disabled organizations canâ€™t be updated until they are enabled. In the list of organizations in the details pane for the disabled organization, the **Update** column will show that an update is **Available**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Before you import, upgrade, or update a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] organization, you should back up the configuration and organization databases.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can implement the procedure described here by using a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../includes/pn-powershell.md)] cmdlet. For more information, see the [Enable-CrmOrganization](/powershell/module/microsoft.crm.powershell/enable-crmorganization?view=dynamics365ce-ps) and [Update-CrmOrganization](/powershell/module/microsoft.crm.powershell/update-crmorganization?view=dynamics365ce-ps) commands.  
  
### Update a disabled organization  
  
1.  To enable the organization, in the details pane, right-click the disabled organization, and then select **Enable**.  
  
2.  To update the organization, in the details pane, right-click the organization, and then select **Update**.  
  
## Update management  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] updates include security, performance, and functional improvements. Making sure that your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] applications have the latest updates helps make sure that your system is running as efficiently and reliably as it can.

# Integrate external data

The topics in this section explain how you can integrate data from sources outside of [!INCLUDE [pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].

- Virtual entities. A virtual entity is a custom entity in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) that has fields containing data from an external data source. More information: [Create and edit virtual entities](create-edit-virtual-entities.md)
- Alternate keys. With alternate keys, you can have an efficient and accurate way of integrating data from external systems. This is especially important in cases when an external system doesnâ€™t store the record IDs (GUIDs) that uniquely identify records. [Define alternate keys to reference records](define-alternate-keys-reference-records.md)

# Sort records in a view

<a name="BKMK_ConfigureSorting"></a>    
  
1.  When you create or edit the view, select **Configure Sorting**.  
  
2.  In the **Configure Sort Order** dialog box, in the **Sort By** list, select the column you want to sort, then select **Ascending Order** or **Descending Order**.  
  
3.  Select **OK** to close the **Configure Sort Order** dialog box.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Grids in Unified Interface apps take the list of displayed columns from the underlying FetchXML of the view. If the FetchXML that is returned from the server does not have a column, then that column is not displayed. This is in contrast to the classic web application, where if a column is not present in FetchXML but is in LayoutXML, such a column is automatically added to the list of displayed columns. Unified Interface apps use OData directly with FetchXML to retrieve data from the server.

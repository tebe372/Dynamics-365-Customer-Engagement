# Create or edit a view



<a name="BKMK_CreatingAndEditingViews"></a>   

 You can create custom public views by editing existing views and saving them with a different name or by creating a new view.  
  
### Create a new view  
  
1.  As described in [Access view definitions](../customize/accessing-view-definitions.md), from a list view for the entity, on the command bar, select **New System View**.  
  
2.  In the **View Properties** dialog box, provide a **Name** and optionally a **Description** for the view.  
  
3.  After you close the properties dialog you can do the following:  
  
    -   [Choose and configure columns](../customize/choose-and-configure-columns.md)  
  
    -   [Edit filter criteria](../customize/edit-filter-criteria.md)  
  
    -   [Configure sorting](../customize/configure-sorting.md)  
  
4.  When you are finished, select **Save and Close**.  
  
5.  Select **Publish All Customizations**.  
  
### Edit a view  
  
1. Open solution explorer.
  
2.  Under **Components**, expand **Entities**, and then expand the entity you want.  
  
3.  Select **Views**.  
  
4.  Double-click the view you want to edit.  
  
5.  To change the **Name** or the **Description** for the view, select **View Properties**.  
  
6.  Do the following:  
  
    -   [Choose and configure columns](../customize/choose-and-configure-columns.md)  
  
    -   [Edit filter criteria](../customize/edit-filter-criteria.md)  
  
    -   [Configure sorting](../customize/configure-sorting.md)  
  
7.  When you are finished, select **Save and Close**.  
  
8. Select **Publish All Customizations**.  
  
## Create a new view from an existing view  
 Follow the procedure to edit a view, except instead of choosing **Save and Close**, select **Save As** and enter a new **Name** and **Description** for the view.

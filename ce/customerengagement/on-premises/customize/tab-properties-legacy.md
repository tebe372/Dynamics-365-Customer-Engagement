# Work with form tabs

 In the body of a form, tabs provide horizontal separation. Tabs have a label that can be displayed. If the label is displayed, tabs can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide their content by choosing the label.  

 Tabs contain up to three columns and the width of each column can be set to a percentage of the total width. When you create a new tab, each column is pre-populated with a section.  

## Tab properties
You can access **Tab properties** in solution explorer. Under **Components**, expand **Entities**, expand the entity you want, and then select **Forms**. In the list of forms, open the form of type **Main**. Then double-click inside one of the tabs on the form canvas to view tab properties.

 The following table shows properties that may be set for tabs on the form:

# How security affects synchronization between Dynamics 365 and Outlook or Exchange
Synchronization of data between [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../../includes/pn-exchange.md)] can be affected by security settings determined by your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrator. For example, you may not be able to synchronize data from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] for a particular field if you donâ€™t have read privileges for that field. For more information, see [TechNet: How field security affects synchronization between Dynamics 365 and Dynamics 365 for Outlook](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn832097.aspx).

# Set address book options in Dynamics 365 for Outlook
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
With[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)], when you compose an email message or set up a meeting, you can search for a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] contact directly from the **To** field of the email message or appointment. By default, only the contacts that are synchronized with Dynamics 365 for Outlook and other record types that you own (such as accounts and leads) appear in the address book. Use this process if you want to synchronize all Dynamics 365 contacts, including contacts that you don’t own or to synchronize additional record types that you don’t own.

    -   **Match all items in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]**. Select this option if you want to sync all record types, including record types you don’t own.  
  
5.  If your address book is slow or if there are record types you want to exclude from your address book, under **Change the record types being synchronized to your Address Book**, choose the **Select or change the values for this field** button ![Ellipsis button](../media/ellipsis-button.gif "Ellipsis button").

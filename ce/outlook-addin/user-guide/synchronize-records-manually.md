# Synchronize records manually with Dynamics 365 for Outlook
By default, changes made in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] every 15 minutes. You can set personal options in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] to change how often data is synchronized, but you canâ€™t synchronize data more frequently than every 15 minutes. If you need to synchronize right away, you can do a manual synchronization.  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], click **File** > **Dynamics 365** > **Synchronize** > **Start Synchronization**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you receive the error message "[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] server Not Found", verify that you have Internet connectivity and that the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] server is running. Then try synchronizing again.

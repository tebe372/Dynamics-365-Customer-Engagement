# Which fields can be synchronized between Dynamics 365 and Outlook?
<<<<<<< HEAD
[!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] administrators can control field synchronization between [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)]. For example, admins can control the synchronization direction between pairs of fields. For information about which fields can be synchronized between  [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)], see [TechNet: Which fields can be synchronized between Dynamics 365 and Dynamics 365 for Outlook](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn832089.aspx).

## Prerequisites 

- You must have the required [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps permissions to configure [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] and access the required [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps entities. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Access management in Unified Service Desk](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/unified-service-desk/admin/security-unified-service-desk)

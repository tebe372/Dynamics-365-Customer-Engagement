# Configure notifications (Screen pops) for agents

You configure notifications (screen pops) in Unified Service Desk - Omni-channel Engagement Hub. These notifications "pop up" on the screen, and they contain either general information, or customer-related or process-related information that the agent can act on. Here are some examples of the information that screen pops can contain:

-   Wait time

-   Customer satisfaction score

-   Customer/account name

-   Job title

-   Category

There are two types of notifications:

-   Alert notifications (screen pop)

-   Toast notification (floating notifications)

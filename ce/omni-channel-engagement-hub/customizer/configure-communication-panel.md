# Configure communication panel for agents

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can configure communication panel for agents to converse with the customers. When you get an incoming conversation notification request and you accept, then you use the communication to engage with the customers.


The steps for configuring Communication panel in Unified Service Desk involves multiple steps:

1.  Create hosted control.

2.  Create action Calls.

3.  Attach the action Calls to events

4.  Add the Hosted Controls, Actions, and Events to the Agent and Supervisor Configurations.

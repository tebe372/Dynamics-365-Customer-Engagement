# Customize the Customer summary form

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

You can customize some forms (cards) on the **Customer summary** page by adding or removing the fields. In addition, you can change the position or alignment of forms (cards) by dragging them to meet your requirements. By default, the **Customer summary** page shows the following forms (cards).

## Customer profile

The **Customer profile** form (card) provides details about the customer or account. These details include the name of the customer or account, the category or job, the title, the relationship type, the city, and the preferred channel of engagement. You can customize this form (card) by adding or removing the fields.

## Conversation summary

The **Conversation summary** form (card) fetches details based on the context of the incoming conversation request. You can modify the fields in this form (card), and also, you can change the position of the form (card) on the **Customer summary** page.

This form (card) includes two tabs: **Pre-chat** and **Visitor info**. The details on these tabs help you to understand contextual channel-specific information about the conversation with the customer. The **Pre-chat** tab shows the conversation details, escalation details, and transfer details.

## Issue Snapshot

For an incoming conversation request, the system links an existing case to the conversation and shows it on the **Issue Snapshot** form (card). This form (card) shows information such as the title of the case, the priority, the status of the case, the product, and the owner. You can customize this form (card) by adding or removing the fields.

## Recent cases

This form section displays the recent cases that relate to the customer.

## All activities

The **All activities** form (card) shows the case-related and customer-related activities in the form of a timeline. You can create quick notes based on your discussion with the customer. You can also filter the timeline by customer activities, case activities, and conversation activities.

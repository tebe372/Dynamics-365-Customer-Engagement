# Share knowledge articles in the Omnichannel for Customer Service

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Enable knowledge article sharing in the Omnichannel for Customer Service so that customer queries can be resolved quickly. You can configure an external portal in the **Customer Service Hub** app, so that your customer service agents can share knowledge article links with the customers from within the Omnichannel for Customer Service app.

Follow these steps to enable knowledge article sharing.

1. In the Customer Service Hub sitemap, go to **Service Management** and select **Knowledge Base Management** > **Embedded Knowledge Search**. 

2. In the **Support Portal Connection** section, enter the following:  

    a. **Use an external portal**. Select **Yes** to enable the external portal and share the article as a link. </br>

    b. **URL Format**. Type the portal URL that will be used to create external (public-facing) portal links for knowledge articles, which the service agents can share with the customers. The external URL is created in the following format: 
        </br> </br> *http://\<support portal URL>/kb/{kbnum}* 
  
     The placeholder "{kbnum}" is replaced by an actual knowledge article number.  

3. Select **Save** to save the settings.

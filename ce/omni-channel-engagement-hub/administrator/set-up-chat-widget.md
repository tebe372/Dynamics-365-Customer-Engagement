## Set up operating hours

You can create operating hours to set the hours during which your organizationâ€™s customer support team is active and available to serve customers. This helps your customers and organization to work together and resolve an issue. After you create an operating hour record, you must add it in the **Design** tab of the appropriate chat widget to make it function.

> [!NOTE]
> The chat widget will be hidden during non-operating hours.

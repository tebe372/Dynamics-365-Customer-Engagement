# Configure a chat channel

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A chat widget lets your customers connect with you in a way that is convenient for them (for example, from their mobile devices or a computer). The customer service agents can then connect with the customers to respond to their queries.

In this section, you will learn how to:

- [Add a chat widget](add-chat-widget.md)
- [Configure agent display name](agent-display-name.md)
- [Configure a pre-chat survey](configure-pre-chat-survey.md)
- [Create a survey question](create-question-library.md)
- [Embed chat widget in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement Portal](embed-chat-widget-portal.md)

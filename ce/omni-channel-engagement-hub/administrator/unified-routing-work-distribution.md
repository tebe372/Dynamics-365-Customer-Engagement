# Understand unified routing and work distribution 

Unified routing and work distribution in Omni-channel Engagement Hub helps ensure effective allocation of work. This benefits both agents and supervisors as agents can prioritize their most urgent tasks and supervisors can help load balance using real-time monitoring.

For example, efficient routing of workload across channels can ensure that:

-   Work is directed and allocated to the right set of agents.

-   Agent attention is always utilized for the most urgent tasks.​

-   The time spent by agents on work items is properly tracked and the agent workforce is utilized in the most efficient manner​.

-   Work items and requests are unified across real-time channels and asynchronous work items like emails, SMS, asynchronous messages, cases, leads, scheduled tasks, and more.

Unified routing and work distribution identify availability of agents and allocate work to them based on the following criteria:

-   Association of agents with queues and channels. Organizations map agents’ skills and proficiencies to the correct set of queues and channels.

-   Real-time capacity and presence of the agent.

-   Maximum concurrency on a channel.

For example, with the help of routing and work distribution, you can route a chat from a customer about a specific query like international life insurance to an agent who is equipped to handle it, as shown in the following illustration:

Routing and work distribution are a two-step process. Routing ensures that a work item is in the right omni-channel queue with the help of routing rules. Once a work item is in its designated omni-channel queue, work distribution comes in and it allocates work items to the available agents in real time, based on configured rules.

To effectively route and distribute the work among agents, you can set up the following in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub as an administrator:

-   Work streams

-   Omni-channel queues

-   Routing rules

-   Users and user profiles

-   Presence status

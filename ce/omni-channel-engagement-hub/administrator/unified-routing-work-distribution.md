# Understand unified routing and work distribution

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Unified routing and work distribution ensures that conversations from all the channels are routed to agents efficiently. This is a two-step process:

1. Routing dispatches conversations into the right omni-channel queues.
2. Work distribution allocates the conversations in a queue to agents in real time, based on capacity and presence.

For example, a chat interaction that comes in from a customer has a specific query about international life insurance. In this case, unified routing and work distribution helps route the chat to an agent who is a member of the 'international' queue, and has available presence and required capacity. This is shown in the following illustration.

Here are some of the benefits of unified routing and work distribution:

- Conversations are evenly allocated to the agents.
- Conversations are allocated to agents based on priorities.
- Agentsâ€™ productivity is tracked by tracking time spent on various conversations.

To effectively route and distribute work to agents, admins can set up the following items in Omni-channel Engagement Hub:

- [Assign roles and enable users for Omni-channel Engagement Hub](add-users-assign-roles.md)
- [Manage users](users-user-profiles.md)
- [Understand work streams in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub](work-streams-introduction.md)
- [Create and manage work streams](create-work-streams.md)
- [Work with queues](queues-omni-channel.md)
- [Set up pre-chat questions to automatically load customer details](record-identification-rule.md)<br>
- [Create and manage routing rules](routing-rules.md)
- [Configure and manage presence status](presence-custom-presence.md)

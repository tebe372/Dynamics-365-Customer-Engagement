# Understand unified routing and work distribution 

Unified Routing and Work Distribution in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub ensures effective allocation of work. This benefit both agents and supervisors as agents can prioritize their most urgent tasks and supervisors can help load balance using real-time monitoring.

For example, efficient routing of workload across channels can ensure that:
- Work is directed and allocated to the right set of agents
- Agent attention is always utilized for the most urgent tasks
- The time spent by agents on conversations is properly tracked and the agent workforce is utilized in the most efficient manner
- Unify the conversations and requests across real-time channels and asynchronous conversations like SMS, Asynchronous messages, Cases, Leads, Scheduled Tasks, and more

Unified Routing and Work Distribution identify availability of agents and allocates work to them based on the following criteria:

- Association of agents with queues and channels
- Real-time capacity and presence of the agent
- Maximum concurrency on a channel

For example, with the help of routing and work distribution, you can route a chat from a customer about a specific query like international life insurance to an agent who is equipped to support it, as shown in the below infographic:

Routing and work distribution is a 2-step process. Routing ensures that a conversation is in the right omni-channel queue with the help of routing rules. Once a conversation is in its designated omni-channel queue, work distribution comes in and it allocates conversations to the available agents in real-time, based on configured rules.

To effectively route and distribute the work among agents, you can set up the following in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub as an administrator:

- Work streams
- Omni-channel queues
- Routing rules
- Users and user profiles
- Presence and Custom Presence

Refer to the following sections to understand routing and work distribution in detail:

- [Create and manage work streams](work-streams.md)
- [Configure Presence and Custom Presence](presence-custom-presence.md)
- [Create and manage users and user profiles](users-user-profiles.md)
- [Create and manage routing rules in Omni-channel](routing-rules.md)
- [Work with queues in Omni-channel Engagement Hub](queues-omni-channel.md)
- [Understand conversation state lifecycle](conversation-state-lifecycle.md)

# Configure an entity channel

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

An SMS channel lets your customers connect with the service agents in your organization using text messages. These conversations are then assigned to agents and they can respond to customer queries.

Follow these steps to configure an entity channel.

1. In the Omni-channel site map, go to **Channels \> Entity**.

2. On the command bar, select **New** to create a new entity channel.
3. In the **General** tab:
 
    - Select the entity to be routed in the **Entity** drop-down list.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You can route any activity enabled entity.

    - A default work stream is associated in the **Work stream** field. Select the search icon to associate another entity work stream. Select **New** to create a new entity work stream. For more information, see [Set up an entity work stream](work-streams-introduction.md#set-up-an-entity-work-stream).

4. Select **Save** to save the channel.

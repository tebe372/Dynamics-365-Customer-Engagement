# Add users and assign roles to users

Use the **Microsoft Office 365 Admin center** to create user accounts for every user who requires access to Omni-channel Engagement Hub. 

For more information about how to add users, see [Create users in Dynamics 365 (online)](../../admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles.md).

All users who are assigned the **Omni-channel supervisor** or **Omni-channel agent** security role become omni-channel users.

## Assign roles to users

Security roles control a user’s access to data through a set of access levels and permissions. The combination of access levels and permissions that are included in a specific security role sets limits on the user’s view of data and on the user’s interactions with that data.

> [!NOTE]
> All customization tasks for the Omni-channel Engagement Hub must be done in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement web application.

Follow these steps to assign roles to users:

1. Select **Settings** > **Security** > **Users**.

2. In the list, select the user or users that you want to assign a security role to.

3. Select **Manage Roles**.

   Only the security roles available for that user's business unit are displayed.

4. In the **Manage User Roles** dialog box, select the security role or roles you want for the user or users, and then select OK.

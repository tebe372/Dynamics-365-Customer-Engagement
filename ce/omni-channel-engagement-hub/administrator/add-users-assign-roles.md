# Assign roles and enable users for Omni-channel Engagement Hub

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

All Dynamics 365 users who are assigned the **Omni-channel administrator**, **Omni-channel supervisor**, or **Omni-channel agent** role are enabled for Omni-channel and become Omni-channel users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To enable users for Omni-channel, your org should have successfully on-boarded to the Omni-channel public preview. Refer [Provision Omni-channel Engagement Hub](omni-channel-provision-license.md) to provision Omni-channel in your Dynamics 365 org.

Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to create user accounts for every user who needs access to Omni-channel Engagement Hub. For more information, see  [Create users in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps and assign security roles](../../admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles.md).

Follow these steps to assign Omni-channel roles to users in the Dynamics 365 web application:

1. Select **Settings** > **Security** > **Users**.

2. In the list, select the user or users that you want to assign a security role to.

3. Select **Manage Roles**.

   Only the security roles available for that user's business unit are displayed.

4. In the **Manage User Roles** dialog box, select the security role or roles you want for the user or users, and then select OK.

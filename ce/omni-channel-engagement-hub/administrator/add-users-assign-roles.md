# Enable users for Omni-channel Engagement Hub

All users who are assigned the **Omni-channel supervisor** or **Omni-channel agent** security role are enabled for omni-channel and become omni-channel users.

> [!NOTE]
> All customization tasks for the Omni-channel Engagement Hub must be done in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement web application.

Follow these steps to assign omni-channel roles to users:

1. Select **Settings** > **Security** > **Users**.

2. In the list, select the user or users that you want to assign a security role to.

3. Select **Manage Roles**.

   Only the security roles available for that user's business unit are displayed.

4. In the **Manage User Roles** dialog box, select the security role or roles you want for the user or users, and then select OK.

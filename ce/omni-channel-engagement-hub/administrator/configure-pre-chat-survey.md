# Configure a pre-chat survey

You can configure your chat widget to show users a survey that they should respond to before they start the conversation.

1. Sign in to Omni-channel Engagement Hub.
2. Go to **Administration** &gt; **Work Streams**.
3. Select the work stream where you created your chat widget.
4. On the **Chat settings** tab, select the name of the chat widget.
5. On the **Survey** tab, in the **Pre-chat survey** field, select **Yes**.
7. Select **Add question** to add questions from the question library. For more information, see [Create a question library](create-question-library.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can add only five questions to a pre-chat survey.

8. In the **Quick Create: Survey Question Sequence** pane, select a question from the question library, and specify whether it's required or optional.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Validations in pre-chat survey are supported only for mandatory fields.

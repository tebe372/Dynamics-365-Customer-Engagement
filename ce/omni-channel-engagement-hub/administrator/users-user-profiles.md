# Create and manage users

All Microsoft Dynamics 365 users who are assigned the omni-channel supervisor or omni-channel agent security role automatically become omni-channel users. Omni-channel users are then assigned roles in the system to distinguish them according to their responsibilities.

When you sign in to omni-channel, you can view the list of omni-channel users in the **Omni-channel Users** view.

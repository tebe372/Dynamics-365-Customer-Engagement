# Configure supervisor dashboard 

Supervisors have a dual responsibility towards the agents and the customers: They monitor, manage, and ensure agents remain highly productive, while ensuring a superior experience for their customers. With these dual roles in mind, the supervisor dashboard consists of information about: 
- Unified views for different roles within the service operations organization. 
- Real-time monitoring and Intraday health tracking of agent productivity and performance. 

As an administrator, you must enable and configure the supervisor dashboard in your organization for supervisor to use it. To configure the dashboard, follow the steps: 
1. [Configure supervisor dashboard to display in Omni-channel Engagement Hub](#configure-supervisor-dashboard-to-display-in-omni-channel-engagement-hub).   
2. [Add users to supervisor configuration](add-users-supervisor-configuration.md).

# Private preview: Configure the supervisor dashboard

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]  

Supervisors have a dual responsibility with respect to agents and customers.â€¯They monitor and manage agents, and make sure that they remain highly productive. At the same time, they help guarantee a superior experience for customers. To help supervisors carry out this dual responsibility, the supervisor dashboard consists of the following information:

- Unified views for different roles in the service operations organization
- Real-time monitoring and intraday health tracking of agent productivity and performance

As an admin, you must enable and configure the supervisor dashboard in your organization before supervisors can use it. To configure the dashboard, follow these steps.

1. [Configure the supervisor dashboard to appear in Omni-channel Engagement Hub](configure-supervisor-dashboard-display-omni-channel-engagement-hub.md).
2. [Add users to the supervisor configuration](add-users-supervisor-configuration.md).

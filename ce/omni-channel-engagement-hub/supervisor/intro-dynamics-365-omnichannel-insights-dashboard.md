# Introduction to Dynamics 365 omnichannel insights dashboard

Customer service managers or supervisors are responsible for managing the agents who work to resolve customer queries every day through various service channels, including Chat. They need to be able to know key operational metrics to ensure that their agents are providing quality support. These metrics seen through trends over a period of time helps them understand how each agent and queue is performing over time, so that they can take corrective measures and provide appropriate guidance to agents and fine tune the customer support experience provided.

Supervisors can use Omnichannel Insights to perform the following tasks: 

-	Monitor Chat operational metrics across Queues and Agents

-	Monitor support quality of chats via sentiment analysis across Queues and Agents.

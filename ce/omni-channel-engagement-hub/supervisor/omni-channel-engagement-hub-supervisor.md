# Omni-channel Engagement Hub for supervisors

Customer service managers or supervisors are responsible for managing the agents who work with customers to resolve queries every day. Another important part of their job is to manage the volumes of service requests or queries that come into the contact center through different service channels.

Omni-channel Engagement Hub provides a dashboard that helps supervisors keep track of the work that their agents do. As a supervisor, you can use this dashboard to perform these tasks:

- Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Monitor agent quality and workload.
- Monitor unassigned workload.
- Manage agent and customer escalations.
- View detailed reports.

As a supervisor, you see the following tabs when you open the Omni-channel Engagement Hub app in Unified Service Desk:

- **Overview**: This tab provides an overview of information about the health and KPIs of agents in your organization. For more information, see [Introduction to supervisor dashboards](introduction-supervisor-dashboards.md).
- **My dashboard**: This tab provides information about the work items that you're handling, such as your active work items, items that are available for you to pick, and closed work items. For more information, see [Introduction to the agent dashboard](../agent/introduction-agent-dashboard.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If configuration errors occur, or if you can't view the dashboard, contact your system admin.

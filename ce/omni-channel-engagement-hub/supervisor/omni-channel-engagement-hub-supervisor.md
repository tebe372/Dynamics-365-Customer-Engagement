# Omni-channel Engagement Hub for supervisor

Customer service managers or supervisors are responsible for managing agents who work with customers to resolve queries each day. Also, key part of their job is to manage volumes of service requests or queries that are coming into the contact center through different service channels.  

Dynamics 365 Omni-channel Engagement Hub provides you with a dashboard that helps you to keep track of the work your agents are doing. With this dashboard, you can: 

-   Monitor key performance indexes (KPI)

-   Monitor quality and workload of agent

-   Monitor unassigned workload

-   Manage agent and customer escalations

<!-- -->

-   View detailed reports

As a supervisor, when you open the Omni-channel Engagement Hub app in Unified Service Desk  

- **Overview:** Provides overall information about the health and KPIs of agents in your organization. More information: [View overall performance](#_View_overall_performance).   

- **My dashboard:** provides information about the work items that you are handling such as your active work items, items available for you to pick, and closed work items. More information: [Introduction to the agent interface in Omni-channel Engagement Hub](introduction-agent-interface-omni-channel-engagement-hub.md).   

**Note:**

Contact your system administrator, for configuration errors or if you are unable to view the dashboards.

# View conversations on Customer Service Hub app

The Omni-channel Engagement Hub on web browser is a solution on Dynamics 365 Customer Service Hub. Omni-channel Engagement Hub on web browser is a single interface for various communication channels. As a supervisor, you can view conversations that are assigned agents through the Conversations view provided to you. The view displays the conversations that are in active, open, and waiting states and filter these conversations using queues. By viewing, you can get a holistic data of the conversations with the details of customer, agent assigned, subject, queue, and activity status.

Review the following requirements to get the Conversations view:
- You must have supervisor role assigned to you. More information: [Create and manage users](administrator/users-user-profiles.md).
- You must have access to supervisor dashboard in Unified Service Desk. More information: [Add users to the supervisor configuration](add-users-supervisor-configuration.md).

To go to the Conversations view follow these steps:
1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement apps.

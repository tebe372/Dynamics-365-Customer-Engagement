# Omni-channel Engagement Hub for customer

Nowadays, customers are looking forward to a great customer experiences in every touchpoint with organizations. In this scenario, messaging emerges as a key support channel that allows a customer to interact with an organization instantly.

The chat widget allows your customers to connect with you in the way that is convenient for them, for example, from their mobile devices or a computer. The available agent can then connect with the customer to resolve their query.

The chat widget is displayed on the websites or portals to the customers in the minimized mode. To display the chat widget on a website or a portal, an administrator must embed the JavaScript snippet in the code while configuring the chat.

After the chat is configured, it has the following capabilities:

- **Minimized mode**: By default, the chat widget is displayed in the minimized mode. If any message is received in this mode, the count of the messages is displayed.

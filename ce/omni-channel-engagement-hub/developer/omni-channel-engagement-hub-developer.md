<!--note from editor:  In below items, change "the context" to "the context provider", the wording used in other topics?  -->

> [!NOTE]
> The live chat SDK methods listed in this developer guide are subject to change until the live chat feature becomes generally available.

Omni-channel Engagement Hub live chat SDK provides methods that allow you to:
- Set, retrieve and remove custom context for a live chat session.
- Open an existing chat or initiate a new one.
- Set, retrieve, and remove authentication-token providers.

These APIs will be available for use once the live chat widget loads on the web page.

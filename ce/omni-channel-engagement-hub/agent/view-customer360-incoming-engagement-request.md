# View Customer 360 for an incoming engagement request

## Scenario 1: Incoming engagement request for an existing customer record with a case already in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub 

When you get an incoming engagement request, you see a notification (screen pop) with contextual information for an incoming request. When accept or select the incoming notification, the Customer 360 page opens with the details of the customer and case.

## Scenario 2: Incoming engagement request where you find several customer records in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub 

When you get an incoming engagement request, you see a notification (screen pop) with contextual information for an incoming request. The Omni-channel Engagement Hub displays a message â€“ **One or more records found. Select a record or create new**.

### Select a record

If you select a case, the contact or account opens the Customer 360 page by prepopulating the details.

If you select a contact or account, the Customer 360 page refreshes and updates the **Snapshot** section with the current case details.

If you choose a case that is different than the one you are assigned, then you see a warning message that needs your action to link the conversation to the record.

### Create a record

You can create a contact or account using the quick create option. After you create the record, the case is automatically linked to the conversation.

However, there are no records present in Omni-channel Engagement Hub based on the contextual information obtained from the notification (screen pop).

# Introduction to agent dashboard

When you sign in to Unified Service Desk, you land on the **My Dashboard** page of the Omni-channel Engagement Hub. The **My Dashboard** page is a multi-stream view of the work items where you can view the work items that you are actively working on, work items that are available for you to pick from the queues, and work items that you completed within the last 24 hours.

The **Home** button on the **Session Management** tab provides a quick navigation to the dashboard page, and when you select the button, the dashboard appears on the **Application Management** tab. The **My Dashboard** page consists of the following work streams:

-   My work items

-   Open work items

-   Closed work items

### My work items

In this work stream, you see the work items that you are actively working. Select the ellipsis and select the **Open** option to open the work item as a session in the session management tab.

### Open work items

In this work stream, you see the work items in waiting state from all queues that are available for you to pick. You can see the work items for the work streams where you are added as a member. Select the ellipsis and select the **Pick** option to assign the work item to you. When you select **Pick**, the system moves the work item from **Open work items** stream to **My work items** stream and you can see the message - **Work item picked successfully. Work item: &lt;subject of work item&gt;** . You can see the subject of the work item that you picked.

### Closed work items

In this work stream, you see the work items that you completed during the past 24 hours. The work stream refreshes every business to reflect the work items that you closed in past 24 hours. To view a closed work item, select the ellipsis and then select the **Open** option to view the details in a form.

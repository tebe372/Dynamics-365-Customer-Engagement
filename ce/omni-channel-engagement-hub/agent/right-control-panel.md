### KB articles control

Knowledge management plays an important part in the customer service process, and access to accurate and up-to-date information can help you reduce the average handle time to provide quick and accurate answers to your customers.

Omni-channel Engagement Hub enables you to use the rich knowledge base in Dynamics 365 from within the desktop so that you can quickly search for relevant knowledge while working on a case, and provide accurate answers to the customers, without having to switch applications.

You can search for the KB articles, open the articles as a tab in the Application tab management toolbar. Also, you can share the link of the KB article to the customer with whom you are engaging using the Send Link option. When you select the Send Link option, the link is pasted in the chat window (conversation control).

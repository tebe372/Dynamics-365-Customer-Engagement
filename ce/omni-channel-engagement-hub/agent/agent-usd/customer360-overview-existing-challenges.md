# Customer 360 - Know everything about customers

## overview of the existing challenges

One of the major challenges that customers face when contacting the customer support is providing repetitive information about the issue with the support agent. Also, if the customer wants to review the status of the request raised at a later stage, the customer shares the same information with another support agent to explain the context of the conversation. To avoid this situation, the support agent must access to the customer information with details about the product/service, issue, cases history, related cases, location, and so on.

By having this information ready when customers contact them, support agents can help reduce the hold time that they spend retrieving customer information, reduce average handling time (AHT), and increase customer satisfaction through faster resolution of the issue.

### What is Customer 360?

**Customer 360** is a page where you can get complete information about a customer when you accept an incoming request from any engagement channel. The default view of the **Customer 360** page provides the following sections:

   - Customer profile

   - Conversation summary

   - Issue Snapshot

   - Recent cases

   - All activities

#### Customer profile

The **Customer profile** section provides details about the customer, such as the name of the customer or account, job, title, relationship type, city, category, relationship type, primary contact for the account, and preferred channel for engagement.

#### Conversation summary

This section provides two tabs with details that helps you to understand the information about the conversation with the customer. **Pre-chat** and **Visitor info** are the tabs in the Conversation summary card. The Pre-chat tab displays the survey answers against the questions that are requested by your organization, which helps your interaction with the customer. The Visitor info tab provides some information like the browser used by the customer for contacting support, operating system used by the customer, location of the customer, interacting language of the customer and so on.

#### Issue Snapshot

For an incoming conversation request, the system links an existing case to the conversation, and shows it in the **Issue Snapshot** section. This section shows  information such as the title of the case, its priority, its status, the product, and the owner.

#### Recent cases

This section displays the recent cases that relate to the customer.

#### All activities

This section displays the case- and customer-related activities in the form of a timeline. You can create quick notes based on the discussion with the customer. Also, you can filter the timeline to view it based on the Customer activities, Case activities, and Conversation activities.

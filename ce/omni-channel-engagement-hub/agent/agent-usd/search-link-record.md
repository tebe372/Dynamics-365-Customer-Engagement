[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The topic explains how to search for a record in Omni-channel Engagement Hub and link it to a conversation.

## Search for a record
You can search for the records in two ways.

### Search for a record using inline search option

You accept an incoming conversation request and there is no customer record identified in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub. In this case, use the inline search option in the **Customer profile** form and **Issue snapshot** form to search for a contact or account and case respectively.

The inline search is based on the Lookup view. You can search the fields (attributes) that is based on the lookup view.

| Entity | Searchable fields (attributes) | Status |
|--------|--------------------------------|--------|
| Accounts | Email |  |
|  | Phone |  |
|  | Name |  |
|  | Address |  |
|  | City |  |
|  | Pin code |  |
| Incident | Case number |  |
|  | Title |  |

Only active lookup views are displayed for the search results. Also, you can customize the lookup views to change the searchable fields as per your business requirements.

After the search results, selecting a record links the conversation to the selected record and loads the **Customer summary** form with the details.

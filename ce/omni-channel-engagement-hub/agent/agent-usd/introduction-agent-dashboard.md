# View agent dashboard and agent work items

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

When you first sign in to Unified Service Desk, you see the **My Dashboard** page of Omni-channel Engagement Hub. This page provides a multi-stream view of conversations. Here, you can view the conversations that you're actively working on, conversations that are available for you to pick from the queues, and conversations that you've completed during the last 24 hours.

The **Home** button on the **Session Management** tab provides quick navigation to the **My Dashboard** page. When you select this button, the dashboard appears on the **Application Management** tab.

The **My Dashboard** page consists of the following views:

 - My work items

 - Open work items

 - Closed work items

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![omni-channel engagement hub agent interface](../../media/oc-usd-agent-interface.png "Omni-channel engagement hub agent interface")

## My work items

In the **My work items** view, you see all the work items that you're actively working on. Select the ellipsis button (**...**) for a work item, and then select **Open** to open the work item as a session on the **Session Management** tab.

## Open work items

In the **Open work items** view, you see all the conversations that are in the **Waiting** state, from all the queues that are available for you to pick from. Work items are shown for all the queues where you're added as a member. Select the ellipsis button (**...**) for a work item, and then select **Pick** to assign the work item to you. When you select **Pick**, the system moves the work item from **Open work items** view to the **My work items** view, and you can see the following message: **Work item picked successfully. Work item: <Subject of the work item>**.

## Closed work items

In the **Closed conversations** work stream, you see all the conversations that you've completed during the past 24 hours. The work stream refreshes to reflect the conversations that you closed in past 24 hours. To view a closed work item, select the ellipsis button (**...**) for it, and then select **Open** to view the details.

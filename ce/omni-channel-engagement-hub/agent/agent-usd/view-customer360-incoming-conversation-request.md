# View customer summary for an incoming conversation request

## Scenario 1: Incoming conversation request for an existing customer record that already has a case in Omni-channel Engagement Hub  

When you receive an incoming conversation request, you see a notification (screen pop) that contains contextual information for the request. When you accept or select the notification, the **Customer 360** page appears. This page shows the details of the customer and case.

## Scenario 2: Incoming conversation request where you find several customer records in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub 

When you receive an incoming conversation request, you see a notification (screen pop) that contains contextual information for the request. Omni-channel Engagement Hub shows the following message: **One or more records found. Select a record or create new**.
### Select a record

If you select a case, the contact or account opens the **Customer 360** page by prepopulating the details.

If you select a contact or account, the **Customer 360** page is refreshed, and the **Issue Snapshot** section is updated with the current case details.

If you select a case that differs from the case that is assigned to you, you receive a warning message and must link the conversation to the record.

### Create a record

You can create a contact or account by using the quick create option. After you create the record, the case is automatically linked to the conversation. However, no records are present in Omni-channel Engagement Hub, based on the contextual information that is obtained from the notifications (screen pops).

# Create a record in Omni-channel Engagement Hub

When there are no records linked to the conversation in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub, you can create a record using the quick create (+) option. After you create the record, the record is automatically linked to the conversation.

1. Select the **+** icon to create a new record.<br>

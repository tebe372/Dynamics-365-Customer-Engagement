# Notifications and Screen pop

Notification is a visual alert you see as a dialog box each time you get a call, email, chat, and SMS conversation request from a customer. Even when you minimize the Omni-channel Engagement Hub application, you will get a visual notification. When you get a notification, you see the details of the customer with whom you are going to interact. In addition, in certain types of notifications, you see an accept and reject button that indicates the action you need perform to accept or reject an incoming conversation request. When you accept the request, a screen pops up with the contextual information of the customer and case.

Some of the scenarios where you can see the screen pop or notifications are:

 - Incoming chat

 - Incoming email

 - Case assignment

 - Case transfer

 - Case escalation

### Type of notifications

There are two types of notifications:

 - Toast notifications or floating notifications

 - Alert notifications

#### Toast notifications or floating notifications

Toast notification or floating notification is a notification message type where you an information in a screen pop dialog and the dialog disappears after a stipulated time. While you are viewing the notification, if you select the notification, the associated session or application is displayed.

Toast notifications or floating notifications appear for SMS, email, voice call, consult, and transfer scenarios. This kind of notification may or may not have buttons that require your actions, which depends on your business requirements.

#### Alert notifications

Alert notification is a type of notification where a dialog appears with actionable buttons, when you select the accept button, a screen pops with Customer 360 details. You need to take an action within the stipulated time and screen pop dialog vanishes when the time is out. If your business demands an auto-accept request for an incoming request based on the routing rules, you see the notification with no buttons.

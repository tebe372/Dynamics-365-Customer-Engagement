# View omni-channel conversations and omni-channel session in Dynamics 365 apps

In your organization, some agents might work in a contact center that uses Omni-channel Engagement Hub, whereas other agents work in a different contact center that uses Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps, such as Customer Service Hub. In this case, if you're an agent who works in Dynamics 365 apps, and you must analyze a conversation request from Omni-channel Engagement Hub, you can find the information through **activities** in Dynamics 365..

You can find the following activity types in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps:

 - Conversation form

 - Omni-channel session

By default, you see **My Dashboard**, which displays information about the tasks that you work on.

- **Activities**

Activities are the details of interactions between the customer and you, such as history of the conversation, transcript of the conversation, session details, and more.

- **Queues**

    Queues are the route where the cases are assigned to you. Your organization can create queues and agents based on the business requirement. This ensures that you get tasks from the queues to which you are added as an agent.

- **Knowledge articles**

    Knowledge articles are articles about the questions, issues, feedback, resolutions, best practices, and guidelines that are helpful. You can share the articles with the customers and help them to resolve the cases.

# Create a record

When no records are linked to the conversation in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub, you can create a record using the quick create (**+**) option. After you create the record, it is automatically linked to the conversation.

1.  Select the **+** icon to create a new record.

2.  Select a record type from the list.

-   Case

-   Contact

-   Account

    In the left pane, you can see a new record page.

    1.  Specify the details in the form and save the changes.

After you save the changes, the record is linked to the conversation. You can see the linked conversation in the Customer summary page.

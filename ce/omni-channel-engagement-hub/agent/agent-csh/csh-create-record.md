# Create a record

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

When no records are linked to the conversation in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub, you can create a record using the quick create (**+**) option. After you create the record, it is automatically linked to the conversation.

1.  Select the **+** icon to create a new record.

2.  Select a record type from the list. <br>
 - Case
 - Contact
 - Account

 > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
 > ![Quick create record](../../media/oc-csh-create-quick-create.png "Quick create record")

3. In the left pane, you can see a new record page. Specify the details in the form.

4. Select **Save and Close** to save the changes and close the form.

 > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
 > ![Quick create contact](../../media/oc-csh-quick-create-contact.png "Quick create contact")

After you save the changes, the record is linked to the conversation. You can see the linked conversation in the Customer summary page.

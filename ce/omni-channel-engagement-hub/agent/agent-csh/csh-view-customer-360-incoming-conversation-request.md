# View customer summary for an incoming conversation request

## Scenario 1: An incoming engagement request for an existing customer record with a case already in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub 

When you get an incoming conversation request, you see a notification (screen pop) with contextual information for an incoming request. When you accept or select the incoming notification, the application displays the Customer summary page with details about the customer.

## Scenario 2: An incoming conversation request where you find several customer records in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub 

When you get an incoming conversation request, you see a notification (screen pop) with contextual information about the incoming request. The Omni-channel Engagement Hub displays a message: **One or more records found. Select a record or create new**.

### Select a record

If you select a record, the Customer summary page displays details by pre-populating the fields.

If you select a case, contact, or account, the Customer summary page refreshes and updates the **Issue** **Snapshot** section with the current case details.

If you choose a case that is different than the one you are assigned, you will see a warning message that needs your action to link the conversation to the record. More information: [Search a record](#search-for-a-record)  

### Create a record

You can create a record using the quick create (+) option. After you create the record, it is automatically linked to the conversation. More information: [Create a record](#create-a-record)

## Scenario 3: An incoming conversation request where you find no customer records in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub

When you get an incoming conversation request, you will see a notification (screen pop) with contextual information for an incoming request. However, if no records are linked to a conversation in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub, you will see this message: **No records found. Search for an existing customer record or create a new one to link to this conversation**.

### Create a record

When no records are linked to a conversation in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub, you can create one using the quick create (**+**) option. After you create the record, it is automatically linked to the conversation. More information: [Create a record](#create-a-record)

### Search for a record

When you choose to search for a record, the application launches the **Omni-channel search** tab. Specify the details according to the field and then search. Once the search is complete, you can see the results in the form of a list. You can link the record to the conversation. Also, if you select a record, you can see it in the application management toolbar.

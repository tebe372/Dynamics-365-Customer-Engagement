# Take notes specific to conversation

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

## Take notes

The communication panel allows you to capture information specific to the conversation when you interact with the customers. Use the notes option in the communication panel or the shortcut key to launch the notes.

 > ![Launch notes panel for taking notes](../../media/csh-cc-option-notes.png "Launch notes panel for taking notes")  

You can capture notes only when you link a contact to the conversation.

When you select the notes option from the communication panel, the application displays the notes panel next to the communication panel. You can capture the points and select **Add**. The notes are linked to the conversation for you to access at a later point. You can view the notes activity in the **Recent activities** timeline.

## Take notes for multi-session

When you are working on multiple sessions and while capturing notes, you switch the session. In this scenario, even though you did not add the notes, the notes are saved and **Recent activities** timeline is updated. Again, if you want to switch back the session where you were taking notes, you must launch the notes panel and take the notes. After you add the notes, this notes will be appended to the previously added notes in the timeline.

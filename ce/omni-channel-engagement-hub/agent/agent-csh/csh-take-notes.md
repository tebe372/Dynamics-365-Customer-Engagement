# Take notes specific to conversation

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The communication panel allows you to capture information specific to the conversation when you interact with the customers. Use the notes option in the communication panel or the shortcut key to launch the notes.

When you select the notes option from the communication panel, the application displays the notes panel next to the communication panel. You can capture the points and select **Add**. The notes will be linked to the conversation for you to access at a later point.

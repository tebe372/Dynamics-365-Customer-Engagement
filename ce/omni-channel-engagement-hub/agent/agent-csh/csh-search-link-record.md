### Search for a record using inline search option

You accept an incoming conversation request and there is no customer record identified in the Omni-channel Engagement Hub. In this case, use the inline search option in the **Customer profile** form and **Issue snapshot** form to search for a contact or account and case respectively.

After the search results, selecting a record links the conversation to the selected record and loads the **Customer summary** form with the details.

The navigation bar also called as main menu is a place where you can navigate between different apps. Also, it displays the navigation you perform to different sitemap records in the form of a bread crumb. The bread crumb displays the module (Service), record type and record.

Selecting the **>** icon on the record type shows you a list of the recent records of the same type you have worked on. 

Similarly, selecting the **>** icon on the record shows you a list of the related records.

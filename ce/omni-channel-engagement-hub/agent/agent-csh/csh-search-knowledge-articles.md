# Search for and share knowledge articles

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Search knowledge articles

Knowledge management plays an important part in the customer service process, and access to accurate and up-to-date information can help you reduce the average handling time to provide quick and accurate answers to your customers.

Omni-channel Engagement Hub enables you to use the rich knowledge base (KB) in Dynamics 365 so that you can quickly search for relevant information while working on a case and provide accurate answers to customers without having to switch applications.

You can search for a KB article using the **KB Search** tab, and then view the article and use the **Send Link** option to share the link with the customer.

When you interact with a customer in the conversation control, you can use the **Knowledge articles** option to launch the **KB Search** tab. Then you can search and share the KB articles.

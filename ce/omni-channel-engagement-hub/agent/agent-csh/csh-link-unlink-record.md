# Link and unlink a record to the conversation

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The topic explains how to link and unlink a record to the conversation.

## Link a record to the conversation

Based on the search results, you can choose to link a record from the list. You can link only one record to a conversation.

![Select the record to link](../../media/csh-oc-search-link-account-record.png "Select the record to link")  

1.  Select the ![Record selection icon](../../media/csh-oc-search-record-selection-icon.png "Record selection icon") icon to view the selection list. <br>![Select icon to open selection of records to link](../../media/csh-oc-select-icon-link.png "Select icon to open selection of records to link")

2.  Select the check box next to the record you want to link.<br> ![Record selection checkbox](../../media/csh-oc-record-selection-checkbox.png "Record selection checkbox")  

3.  Select the link button at the top.<br> ![Select record to link](../../media/csh-oc-select-record-link.png "Select record to link")

After you link the record to the conversation, the Customer summary page refreshes and reflects the details. Similarly, you can link other record types.

## Unlink a record from the conversation

You can unlink a record only when you are interacting with customer using the communication panel. That is, after you accept an incoming conversation request and view the **Customer summary** page, you can unlink the record from the conversation. 

![Select X button next the textbox to unlink](../../media/csh-oc-unlink-customer.PNG "Unlink a record")

To unlink a record, select the **X** button next to the customer name in the **Customer profile** form. After the record is removed, the **Customer profile** form is blank.

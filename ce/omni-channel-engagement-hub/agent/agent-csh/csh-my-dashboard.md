# View agent dashboard and agent work items

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The My Dashboard is a default view when you sign in to the application. The dashboard displays the following forms:

-   My work items

-   Open work items

-   Closed work items

### My work items

In this work stream, you see the items that you are actively working on. Select the ellipses and select the **Open** option to open the work item as a session.

### Open work items

In this work stream, you see the work items in a waiting state from all queues that are available for you to pick from. You can see the work items for the work streams where you are added as a member. Select the ellipses and select the **Pick** option to assign the work item to you. When you select **Pick**, the system moves the work item from the **Open work items** stream to the **My work items** stream and you can see the message **Work item picked successfully. Work item: &lt;subject of work item&gt;** . You can see the subject of the work item that you picked.

### Closed work items

In the **Closed conversations** work stream, you see all the conversations that you've completed during the past 24 hours. The work stream refreshes to reflect the conversations that you closed in past 24 hours. To view a closed work item, select the ellipsis button (**...**) for it, and then select **Open** to view the details.

You can see the work items for the work streams where you are added as a member. Select the ellipses and select the **Pick** option to assign the work item to you. When you select **Pick**, the system moves the work item from the **Open work items** stream to the **My work items** stream and you can see the message **Work item picked successfully. Work item: &lt;subject of work item&gt;** . You can see the subject of the work item that you picked.

### Closed work items

In this work stream, you see the work items that you completed during the past 24 hours. The work stream refreshes every business day to reflect the work items that you closed in the past 24 hours. To view a closed work item, select the ellipses and then select the **Open** option to view the details in a form.

# Introduction to the agent interface of Omni-channel Engagement Hub

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Components in the agent interface

When you sign in to Omni-channel Engagement Hub app, the agent interface has the following components:

1. Session panel

2. Communication panel (Collapsed mode)

3. Application tab

4. Omni-channel Agent Dashboard

5. Navigation bar buttons

## Session panel

The vertical panel on the left side is the session panel that allows you (agent) to work on multiple customer sessions simultaneously. In addition, as an agent you can switch between sessions without losing context of the conversation and customer details. The ability to handle multiple sessions simultaneously (while preserving customer context) allows you to resolve issues faster and achieve higher productivity.

By default, the session panel is in expanded mode and it is collapsible based on your requirement. The **Home** session is default and you can't close the **Home** session. The Home session shows the default **Omni-channel Agent Dashboard**.

## Communication panel

Communication panel is where you, as an agent, interact with your customer. When you sign in to the application, by default, communication panel is in minimized mode. That is, the minimized communication panel appears at the bottom left side. The landing page explains some of the key features of Omni-channel Engagement Hub and communication panel. To learn more, see [View communication panel](csh-conversation-control.md)

## Application tab

The horizontal bar below the Dynamics 365 Nav bar is called the application tab. Every customer session has at least one that is not closable and it is called Anchor tab. The Application tab has **+** icon, if you select the icon, the sitemap is available as a context menu. The sitemap shows the out-of-box and custom entities.

# Manage sessions in Omni-channel Engagement Hub

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Start and close a session

As an agent, you can start the sessions in two ways:

- **Manual:** Select **More options** (**...**) in the dashboard and select **Open** or **Pick** to start the session. Open as a session is available for **My work items** and **Open work items** streams. Pick is available in **Open work items** streams. <br>
Also, you can press **Shift** and select on a link to open as a session. You can't use the shortcut to open any other links apart from session enabled entities.

- **Accept incoming conversation:** Accept the incoming conversation or by selecting the work items from **Omni-channel Agent Dashboard**. After the session starts, the customer summary page is loaded in the form area.

You can close any session manually by selecting the **X** button next to the session title.

## Mode of Session panel

By default, the session panel is in expanded mode and it is collapsible based on your requirement. The **Home** session is default and you can't close it. The Home session shows the default **Omni-channel Agent Dashboard**.

## Title and icon of the session

By default, the title of session is name of the entity. That is, the title can be of case, account, or contact name. When you get an unauthenticated incoming conversation request, you can search and link the record in the customer or Case forms. After linking, the session title is automatically updated.

By default, the first two letters of the session title is displayed as the session icon.

# Manage sessions in Omni-channel Engagement Hub

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The vertical panel on the left side is the session panel that allows you (the agent) to work on multiple customer sessions simultaneously. As an agent, you can switch between sessions without losing context of the conversation and customer details. The ability to handle multiple sessions simultaneously (while preserving customer context) allows you to resolve issues faster and achieve higher productivity.

The session panel

When a session is started, the following happens:

- The presence status is updated as per the configuration set by your administrator.
- The communication panel is displayed so you can interact and exchange messages with the customer.
- The Customer summary page is loaded with the details of customer such as contact or account name, case, conversation summary and so on.

## Start a session

As an agent, you can start the sessions in two ways:

- Manually start a session
- Automatically start a session using the incoming notification
 
When you start a session, the presence status is updated as per the configuration set for you by your administrator. In addition, the communication panel is displayed so you can communicate with the customer.

### Manually start a session

Use a combination of keyboard and mouse click gesture to start a session. You can press **Shift** and select on a link to open as a session. You can't use the gesture to open any other link apart from Customer Engagement session enabled records.

> [!Tip]
> Alternatively, from the Omni-channel Agent Dashboard, select **More options** (**...**) and select **Open** or **Pick** to start the session. **Open** is available for **My work items** and **Closed work items** streams. **Pick** is available in **Open work items** streams.

### Automatically start a session using the incoming notification

When you accept an incoming conversation request by selecting the **Accept** button, the session is started and the customer summary page is loaded in the Unified Interface application area.

## Work on multiple customer sessions

As an agent, when you are working on a case, you get an incoming conversation request (chat), and you accept the request. This starts a new session and the customer summary page is loaded with context of the session. You can add applications such as KB Search, Open records, and any Line-of-Business applications made available in the app tab panel sitemap. You can add these applications using the gestures, sitemap, and the options in the communication panel.

When you switch sessions, unsaved changes are not lost and you can continue to work on them

For example, you are working on a case by entering the title of the case and not yet saved the form. Now, you get a notification about the incoming conversation and you accept the request, which leads to starting of a new session. Again, you can switch back to case session and the data entered is present for you to continue.

## Close a session

You can close any session manually by selecting the **X** button next to the session title.

## Mode of Session panel

By default, the session panel is in expanded mode and it is collapsible based on your requirement.
At all times, the **Home** session is default and you can't close it. The Home session shows the default dashboard set for you by your administrator.

## Title and icon of the session

- **Session Title**

    By default, the title of session is name of the entity. That is, the title can be of case, account, or contact name. When you get an unauthenticated incoming conversation request, you can search and link the record in the customer or Case forms. After linking, the session title is automatically updated.

    > ![Session icon](../../media/oceh/oceh-session-icon.png "Session icon")

- **Session icon**

    By default, the first two letters of the session title is displayed as the session icon.

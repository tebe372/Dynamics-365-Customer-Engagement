# View alert and toast notifications

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A notification is a visual alert you see as a dialog box each time you get a call, email, chat, or SMS conversation request from a customer. When you get a notification, you see the details of the customer with whom you are going to interact. In addition, in certain types of notifications, you see an accept and reject button that indicates the action you need to perform to accept or reject an incoming conversation request. When you accept the request, a session is started and you can view the contextual information of the customer and case in the customer summary page.

Some of the scenarios for which you can see the screen pop or notifications are:

- Incoming chat conversation

- Incoming SMS conversation

- Incoming email

- Conversation (work item) assignment

- Conversation transfer

- Conversation escalation

## Types of notifications

There are two types of notifications:

- Toast notifications or floating notifications

- Alert notifications

### Toast notifications or floating notifications

A toast notification or floating notification is a notification message type where you receive information in a dialog, which disappears after a stipulated time. If you select the notification, the associated session or application opens.

Toast notifications or floating notifications appear for SMS, email, and chat conversation requests scenarios. Also, they appear for conversation (work item) assignments, conversation escalations, and conversation transfer scenarios. This kind of notification might have buttons that require action from you, depending on your business requirements.

### Alert notifications

An alert notification is a type of notification where a dialog appears with actionable buttons. When you select the **Accept** button, a screen pops up with Customer summary details. You need to take an action within the stipulated time; the screen-pop dialog vanishes when the time is up. If your business requires an auto-accept request for an incoming request based on the routing rules, you will see the notification with no buttons.

## Incoming chat notification

You receive a notification for an incoming chat request. When you accept the chat request, you’ll see a screen pop with details about the customer in the Customer summary page. A simultaneous session starts, and a chat window expands in the left panel of the Unified Service Desk.

The details you’ll see for a chat channel are:

 - Customer profile

 - Snapshot

 - Conversation summary

 - Recent cases

 - Recent activities

## Incoming SMS notification

You receive a notification for a SMS conversation request. When you accept the SMS request, a session is started, and the communication panel appears where you can exchange messages with the customer. When you select the Customer summary option in the communication panel, the customer details are populated on the Customer summary page.

Identification of a customer happens based on the **Mobile Phone** field present in the Contact record in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement. That is, if the incoming SMS conversation is from a phone whose number is present in the mobile phone field of a Contact record, the conversation automatically links to the contact record.

 - Conversation summary

 - Recent cases

 - Recent activities

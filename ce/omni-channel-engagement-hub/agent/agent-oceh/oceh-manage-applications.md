# Manage sessions in Omni-channel Engagement Hub

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The sitemap displays the following record types:

- **Dashboards**

  When you sign in to the application, you see a dashboard that gives you easy-to-read information about the tasks you are working on. Several dashboards are tailored for your role. To see the other dashboards, select the drop-down list next to **Omni-channel Agent Dashboard**. Also, you can see any dashboard as your default view using the **Set As Default** option in the command bar. By default, you see **Omni-channel Agent Dashboard**, which displays information about the tasks that you work on. As an agent, when you sign in to the application, the dashboard displays the following streams:

    - My work items
    - Open work items
    - Closed work items
    
    To learn more, see [View agent dashboard and work items](oceh-omni-channel-agent-dashboard.md).

- **Activities**

  Activities help you keep track of all your customer communications using the **Conversation** and **Session** form types. Activities are the details of the interactions between the customer and you, such as the history of the conversation, a transcript of the conversation, session details, and more.

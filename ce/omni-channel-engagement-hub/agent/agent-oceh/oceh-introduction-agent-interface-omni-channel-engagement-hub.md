# Introduction to the agent interface of Omni-channel Engagement Hub

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

As an agent, you might engage with several customers simultaneously across different channels but managing all the customer sessions is a challenge, especially switching between the sessions while understanding the context of the engagement. Omni-channel Engagement Hub provides a consistent experience regardless of the support channel and organizations can maximize agent productivity.

The Omni-channel Engagement Hub provides key capabilities like:

- Agent dashboard
- Multi-session
- Application tabs associated with sessions
- Customer summary
- Presence management
- Notifications
- Consult with agents and/or supervisors
- Transfer conversation to another agent or queue
- Capture notes specific to the conversation

## Components in the agent interface

When you sign in to the Omni-channel Engagement Hub app, the agent interface has the following components:

1. Session panel

2. Communication panel (hidden mode)

3. Application tab panel

4. Unified Interface application area

5. Navigation bar buttons

## 1. Session panel

The vertical panel on the left side is the session panel that allows you (the agent) to work on multiple customer sessions simultaneously. In addition, as an agent you can switch between sessions without losing context of the conversation and customer details. The ability to handle multiple sessions simultaneously (while preserving customer context) allows you to resolve issues faster and achieve higher productivity.

## 2. Communication panel

The communication panel is where you, as an agent, interact with your customer. When you sign in to the application, by default, the communication panel is in hidden mode. That is, the communication panel appears on the left side next to the session panel only when you accept an incoming conversation request. To learn more, see [View communication panel](oceh-conversation-control.md).


## 3. Application tab panel

The horizontal bar below the Dynamics 365 navigation bar is called the application tab. Every customer session has at least one that is not closable; it is called the Anchor tab. The Application tab has a **+** icon. If you select the icon, the sitemap is available as a context menu. The sitemap shows the out-of-box and custom entities. You press **Ctrl** and select any link to open it in the application tab.

## 4. Unified Interface application area

 When you sign in to Omni-channel Engagement Hub, as an agent, in the application area, you see a dashboard that is set as default by your administrator. If set as default, Omni-channel Agent Dashboard shows the different work items in streams, and the dashboard is present in the application tab of the **Home** session and you can't close the dashboard tab.

   > ![Omni-channel Agent Dashboard shows My work items, Open work items, and closed work items](../../media/oceh/oceh-agent-interface-oceh-dashboard.png "Omni-channel Agent Dashboard")

   The dashboard shows the following work item streams:
    - **My work items**
    - **Open work items**
    - **Closed work items**

     When you select any record, the application displays a new quick create form. For example, select the **Account** record from the list. The application displays the **Quick Create: Account** form. Specify the details in the fields and save the form.

    The key features of agent interface are:

### Administrator experience

- **Data masking**: You can block sensitive data such as credit card information, social security numbers (SSN), or even profanity in a conversation by using data masking. You can create a masking rule and define a regular expression in it to identify the sensitive information and replace it with the masking character. More information: [Create and manage data masking rules](administrator/data-masking-settings.md)

- **Visitor location detection**: You can configure your chat widget to detect a visitor's location based on their latitude and longitude. If you have enabled location detection, a visitor receives a prompt in their web browser when they start to chat. If a visitor allows the location to be shared, the location is detected. Agents can then use this information to provide a personalized support experience. More information: [Set up visitor location detection](administrator/geo-location-provider.md)

- **Agent display name configuration**: To protect an agent's privacy, you can configure your chat widget to display either full name, first name, last name, or nickname of an agent to the customers. If you would like to hide your agent's identity and anonymize, choose to display the nickname. More information: [Configure agent display name](administrator/agent-display-name.md)

- **Simplified configuration experience for administrators**: With this release, administrators can now configure varied customer experiences separately for chat and entity channels. More information: [Configure a chat channel](administrator/set-up-chat-widget.md) and [Configure an entity channel](administrator/create-entity-channel.md)

    Configure context variables and routing rules in work streams to ensure that conversations are distributed to appropriate agents. More information: [Understand and create work streams](administrator/work-streams-introduction.md)

### Agent experience

You can unlink inline on the **Customer profile** and **Issue snapshot** form and link any other required record. More information: [Unlink a record from the conversation](agent/agent-usd/link-unlink-record.md#unlink-a-record-from-the-conversation) and [Unlink a record from the conversation](agent/agent-csh/csh-link-unlink-record.md#unlink-a-record-from-the-conversation)

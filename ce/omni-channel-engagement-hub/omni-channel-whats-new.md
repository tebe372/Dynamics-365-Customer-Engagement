# What's new in Omni-channel Engagement Hub

##  What's new in <version>

This topic contains information about updates in Omni-channel Engagement Hub available in this version.

### Data Masking

### Location Detection

### Live chat SDK

### Simplified workflows for administrators

With the latest release of Omni-channel, the administrators can quickly associate work streams with channels so that conversations can be assigned to agents seamlessly. </br>

For more information, see [Understand and create work streams](administrator/work-streams-introduction.md)

> [!NOTE]
> For a channel, a default work stream is already associated in the Work stream field. Select the search icon to associate another work stream. Select **New** to create a new work stream from within the channel.

Use entity channel to route entities from **Common Data Service for Apps** to the Omni-channel Engagement Hub so that they can be automatically distributed and assigned to agents.

For more information, see [Configure an entity channel](administrator/create-entity-channel.md)

With an improved sitemap, quickly configure channels, work streams, queues, and routing rules so that the agents can quickly assist customer queries.


### Agent anonymization

### PBI-integration simplification 

### Unlink a record (case, contact, and account) from a conversation

You can unlink a record (case, contact, and account) from a conversation while you are interacting with the customer. You can unlink inline on the **Customer profile** and **Issue snapshot** form and link any other required record.

To learn more, see [Unlink a record from the conversation](agent/agent-usd/link-unlink-record.md#unlink-a-record-from-the-conversation) and [Unlink a record from the conversation](agent/agent-csh/csh-link-unlink-record.md#unlink-a-record-from-the-conversation).

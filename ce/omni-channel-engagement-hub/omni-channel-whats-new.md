# What's new in Omni-channel Engagement Hub

##  What's new in March 2019 Update

This topic contains information about updates in Omni-channel Engagement Hub available in this version.

## Administrator Experience

### Data masking

You can block sensitive data such as credit card information, social security numbers (SSN), or even profanity in a conversation by using data masking. You can create a masking rule and define a regular expression in it to identify the sensitive information and replace it with the masking character. More information: [Create and manage data masking rules](administrator/data-masking-settings.md).

### Visitor location detection

You can configure your chat widget to detect a visitor's location based on their latitude and longitude. If you have enabled location detection, a customer receives a prompt in their web browser when they start to chat. If a customer allows the location to be shared, the location is detected. More information: [Set up visitor location detection](administrator/geo-location-provider.md).

### Agent display name configuration

You can configure your chat widget to display either full name, first name, last name, or nickname of an agent to the customers. If you would like to hide your agentâ€™s identity and anonymize, choose to display the nickname. More information: [Configure agent display name](administrator/agent-display-name.md).

### Simplified workflows for administrators

With the latest release of Omni-channel, the administrators can quickly associate work streams with channels so that conversations can be assigned to agents seamlessly. </br>

For more information, see [Understand and create work streams](administrator/work-streams-introduction.md)

> [!NOTE]
> For a channel, a default work stream is already associated in the Work stream field. Select the search icon to associate another work stream. Select **New** to create a new work stream from within the channel.

Use entity channel to route entities from **Common Data Service for Apps** to the Omni-channel Engagement Hub so that they can be automatically distributed and assigned to agents.

For more information, see [Configure an entity channel](administrator/create-entity-channel.md)

With an improved sitemap, quickly configure channels, work streams, queues, and routing rules so that the agents can quickly assist customer queries.

## Agent Experience

### Unlink a record (case, contact, and account) from a conversation

You can unlink a record (case, contact, and account) from a conversation while you are interacting with the customer. You can unlink inline on the **Customer profile** and **Issue snapshot** form and link any other required record.

To learn more, see [Unlink a record from the conversation](agent/agent-usd/link-unlink-record.md#unlink-a-record-from-the-conversation) and [Unlink a record from the conversation](agent/agent-csh/csh-link-unlink-record.md#unlink-a-record-from-the-conversation).

# Introduction to Omni-channel

In the era of digital transformation, customers don’t think about the channels of communication, but about the solutions to their issues. Customers are tech-savvy and they expect a seamless interaction experience to resolve issues.

As a result of the strong digital transformation and technological advancement, customers have access to various media and they want to reach out to contact centers through their channel of choice. However, the success of a customer service organization relies not just on offering a great customer experience but on providing effective solutions to customer issues.

Most organizations do provide multi-channel customer services like voice and email—however, organizations face the challenge of keeping up the momentum in different interaction channels to tackle the touchpoints of customers while simultaneously supporting all the channels in a single interaction experience. Often, these multi-channels are in silos, which in turn can result in scattered communication and unstructured, repetitive, and disorganized information. Ultimately, this can result in ineffective interactions that frustrate customers and lead to low customer satisfaction.

Organizations face a grave challenge to quickly adapt their processes and infrastructure to suit the changing needs of the business and customers.

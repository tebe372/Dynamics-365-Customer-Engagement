# Introduction to Omni-channel Engagement Hub

These days, customers don't think about channels of communication. They think only about getting solutions to their issues. They are tech-savvy, and they expect a seamless interaction experience as they work to resolve issues.

As a result of digital transformation and technological advancement, customers have access to various media, and they expect to reach out to contact centers through the channel of their choice. However, the success of a customer service organization depends not just on offering a great customer experience but on providing effective solutions to customer issues.

Most organizations do provide multi-channel customer services like voice and email—however, organizations face the challenge of keeping up the momentum in different interaction channels to tackle the touchpoints of customers while simultaneously supporting all the channels in a single interaction experience. Often, these multi-channels are in silos, which in turn can result in scattered communication and unstructured, repetitive, and disorganized information. Ultimately, this can result in ineffective interactions that frustrate customers and lead to low customer satisfaction.

Organizations face a serious challenge to quickly adapt their processes and infrastructure to suit the changing needs of both their business and their customers.

Omni-channel Engagement Hub lets you provide customers with their preferred channel, such as voice, text/message, email, social media, chat, or the web. Therefore, in the long term, it helps boost your organization's brand image and credibility as a great customer service organization.

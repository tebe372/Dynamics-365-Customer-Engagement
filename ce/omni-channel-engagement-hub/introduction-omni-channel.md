# Introduction to Omni-channel Engagement Hub

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

These days, customers don't think about channels of communication. They think only about getting solutions to their issues. They are tech-savvy, and they expect a seamless interaction experience as they work to resolve issues.

As a result of digital transformation and technological advancement, customers have access to various media, and they expect to reach out to contact centers through the channel of their choice. However, the success of a customer service organization depends not just on offering a great customer experience but on providing effective solutions to customer issues.

Most organizations do provide multi-channel customer services like voice and email—however, organizations face the challenge of keeping up the momentum in different interaction channels to tackle the touchpoints of customers while simultaneously supporting all the channels in a single interaction experience. Often, these multi-channels are in silos, which in turn can result in scattered communication and unstructured, repetitive, and disorganized information. Ultimately, this can result in ineffective interactions that frustrate customers and lead to low customer satisfaction.

Organizations face a serious challenge to quickly adapt their processes and infrastructure to suit the changing needs of both their business and their customers.

Omni-channel Engagement Hub lets you provide customers with their preferred channel, such as voice, text/message, email, social media, chat, or the web. Therefore, in the long term, it helps boost your organization's brand image and credibility as a great customer service organization.

## What is Omni-channel Engagement Hub?

The Omni-channel Engagement Hub for Dynamics 365 is a robust cloud-based service that extends the power of Dynamics 365 for Customer Service to enable organizations to instantly connect and engage with their customers via channels like Live Chat and SMS.

Omni-channel Engagement Hub also provides a modern, customizable, high-productivity app that allows agents to engage with customers across different channels. The application offers contextual customer identification, real-time notification, integrated communication, and agent productivity tools like KB integration, search, and case creation to ensure agents are effective.

Omni-channel Engagement Hub leads your organization through the conversion experience and seamlessly bridges the gap between customers and live agents. The application empowers the agents to work on simultaneous interactions with multiple customers. It gives supervisors the analytical experience to track the agent’s activities and make decisions that increase the productivity of the agents.

Supervisors get real-time and historical visibility and insights into the operational efficiency of agents and the utilization across various channels.

The enterprise-grade routing and work distribution engine allows customers to configure agent presence, availability, and routing rules, thus ensuring agents are working on the most relevant engagements

Omni-channel Engagement Hub caters to the customer service cycle by empowering the agents, supervisors, and administrators to effectively perform their duties and help resolve customer issues.

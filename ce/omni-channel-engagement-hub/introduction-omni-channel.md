The Omni-channel Engagement Hub for Dynamics 365 is a robust cloud-based service that extends the power of Dynamics 365 for Customer Service to enable organizations to instantly connect and engage with their customers via channels like Live Chat and SMS.

Omni-channel Engagement Hub also provides a modern, customizable, high-productivity app that allows agents to engage with customers across different channels. The application offers contextual customer identification, real-time notification, integrated communication, and agent productivity tools like KB integration, search, and case creation to ensure agents are effective.

Supervisors get real-time and historical visibility and insights into the operational efficiency of agents and the utilization across various channels.

The enterprise-grade routing and work distribution engine allows customers to configure agent presence, availability, and routing rules, thus ensuring agents are working on the most relevant engagements.

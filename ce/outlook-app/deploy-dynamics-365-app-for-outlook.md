# Deploy and install Dynamics 365 App for Outlook  

This topic covers how to set up and deploy Dynamics 365 App for Outlook.

Dynamics 365 App for Outlook works with latest release of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] works with customer engagement apps (such as [Dynamics 365 Sales](../sales-professional/help-hub.md), [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](../customer-service/help-hub.md), [Dynamics 365 Marketing](../marketing/help-hub.md). [Dynamics 365 Field Service](../dynamics365/field-service/overview.md), and [Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation](../dynamics365/project-operations/psa/overview.md)), [Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), version 9](../customerengagement/on-premises/overview.md), and [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin make sure these prerequisites are met:

- Set up synchronization of incoming email through server-side synchronization: [Set up server-side synchronization of email, appointments, contacts, and tasks](/power-platform/admin/set-up-server-side-synchronization-of-email-appointments-contacts-and-tasks)  

- Dynamics 365 App for Outlook is an Outlook add-in that uses Exchange Web Services (EWS) to interact with Microsoft Exchange. This requires OAuth be enabled on Microsoft Exchange. For more information: [Authentication and permission considerations for the makeEwsRequestAsync method](/outlook/add-ins/web-services#authentication-and-permission-considerations-for-the-makeewsrequestasync-method).

- On Windows clients, Internet Explorer 11 should be installed and enabled but not necessarily the default browser. For more information: [Requirements for running Office Add-ins](/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/requirements-for-running-office-add-ins#client-requirements-windows-desktop-and-tablet).

- Verify what's supported: [System requirements, limits, and configuration values for App for Outlook](support-info-deployment.md)


## Step 1: Set the default synchronization method

To use Dynamcis 365 App for Outlook you need to set Server-side synchronization for your email processing. For more information on email synchronization, see [Set incoming and outgoing email synchronization](../power-platform/admin/set-incoming-outgoing-email-synchronization.md)

1. From your app, go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Setting Customizations](media/outlookapp_advancedsettings.png)

2. Go **Settings** > **Administration** and then select **System Settings**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   >![Go to system settings](media/system-settings.png)
   
3. Select the **Email** tab, and set **Process Email Using** to **Server-Side Synchronization**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select server-side sync](media/set-sync-settings.png)


## Step 2: Test eamil configuration and enable mailboxes

Enable and test user mailboxs so they can use Dynamics 365 App for Outlook. 

1. From your app, go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Setting Customizations](media/outlookapp_advancedsettings.png)
   
2. Go **Settings** > **Email Configuration** and then select **Mailboxes**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   >![Go to mailboxes settings](media/mailboxes.png)
   
3. Select the **Active Mailboxes** view, and then select the mailboxes that you want to test and enable. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select the mailboxes that you want to enable](media/select-mailboxes.png)











## Provide security role access

Dynamics 365 App for Outlook is an App Module in version 9. The minimum set of privileges required to run App for Outlook are packaged as a security role called **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** which is bound to the App. You need to add users to this role in order for them to access Dynamics 365 App for Outlook. In order to achieve this, follow the steps below:

1. From your app, go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   >![Setting Customizations](media/outlookapp_advancedsettings.png)

2. Go **Settings** > **Security** and then select **Users**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select a user settings](media/user-settings.png)

3.  Select the users from the list and then select **Manage Roles**.

5.  In the **Manage User Roles** dialog, apply the **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** security role to the users.

This will ensure that the users have the basic privileges needed to access App for Outlook. Other security privileges on top of the basic privileges, related to the user's role, will light up more features. For example, if a user has create privilege on Lead entity, in addition to **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** security role, they would see an email resolve to a Lead entity where applicable.

> [!NOTE]
>  - The security role **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** is available from Build 9.1.0.4206. If a user doesn’t have this security role or its underlying privileges, they’ll receive the following error: 
> “You haven't been authorized to use this app. Check with your system administrator to update your settings.”
>  - At this time, adding a team to the **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** security role doesn't automatically propogate the privileges to the users within that team.







## FAQs

There are two ways to install [!INCLUDE [pn-ms-office](../includes/pn-ms-office.md)]: using a Windows Installer (MSI) version or a Click-to-Run (C2R) version of [!INCLUDE [pn-office-shortest](../includes/pn-office-shortest.md)]. You might have issues accessing [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] in the Add-ins area of [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] if you don't have the necessary updates for your installation version. For more information, see [Issue when trying to access Dynamics 365 apps within the Add-ins area of Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3211586/error-message-0x8006ffff-occurs-when-you-access-dynamics-365-within-th).

## Deploy Dynamics 365 App for Outlook  
 After setting up [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)], you can push [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] to some or all users, or you can have users install it themselves as needed.  

<!--
> [!NOTE]
>  If you're on [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_op](../includes/pn-dyn-365-op.md)], see the section below:  [To deploy to Dynamics 365 apps (on-premises) users](#BKMK_DeployOnprem)  
--> 

#### To push the app to users

4. When you’re done, click **Save**.  

5. Make sure to add users to the security role **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User** as described in the **Provide security role access** section above.

## To deploy to Dynamics 365 apps (on-premises) users  
 Follow these steps if you're using Dynamics 365 apps (on-premises).  

-   Configure your Dynamics 365 apps server for Internet-facing deployment. See [Configure IFD for Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/deployment-administrators-guide/dn609803(v=crm.8)).  

-   If you're connecting to Exchange on-premises, configure the OAuth provider and register client apps. See [Configure Windows Server 2012 R2 for Dynamics 365 apps that use OAuth](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/deployment-administrators-guide/hh699726(v=crm.8)).  


<a name=BKMK_Troubleshoot></a> 
## Troubleshooting installation problems  


1. If you don't see [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] when you click the **Settings** button ![Settings button](../admin/media/mp-ua-r16-settings.png "Settings button"), check that you've enabled the feature.

2. If you or your users have trouble installing [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)], it may be because their [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] mailbox is currently linked to another Microsoft Dataverse environment or Customer Engagement (on-premises) organization. An [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] mailbox (email address) can only synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks with one organization, and a user that belongs to that organization can only synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks with one [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] mailbox.  You can overwrite the setting stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] if you want to change the primary synchronizing organization.

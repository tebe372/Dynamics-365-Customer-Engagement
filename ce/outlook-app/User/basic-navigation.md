# Basic navigation in App for Outlook

Use Dynamics 365 App for Outlook to tap the power of your Dynamics 365 apps while youâ€™re using Outlook on the desktop, web, or phone. When Dynamics 365 App for Outlook is installed, depending on which version of the app you have installed, you'll see a Dynamics 365 pane or window next to a selected Outlook email message, or when you're composing an email message or setting up a meeting or appointment.

1. Select **Dynamics 365** to open the **Dynamics 365** pane.

# Basic navigation in App for Outlook

Extend the power of productivity in Outlook with Dynamics 365 App for Outlook so you can experience your Dynamics 365 apps in context of customer communication in Outlook. Track  emails and appointments in Outlook to your Dynamics 365 app and associate them to the right record.

Use App for Outlook while you’re using Outlook on the desktop, web, or phone. When App for Outlook is installed, depending on which version of the app you have installed, you'll see a Dynamics 365 pane or window next to a selected Outlook email message, or when you're composing an email message or setting up a meeting or appointment.

## Terminology

|Term  |Definition  |
|---------|---------|
|[Set regarding](track-message-or-appointment.md)     |Track and link the email or appointment to an existing row your Dynamics 365 app.|
|[Track](track-message-or-appointment.md)     |Create a copy of the email or appointment in your Dynamics 365 app.   |

## Synchronization and tracking 

The Dynamics 365 App for Outlook tracks and synchronizes your mail and calendar data between Outlook (Exchange) and Dynamics 365 apps. Server Side Synchronization is an asynchronous service that runs in the background approximately every 15 minutes to synchronize items between Exchange and Dynamics 365 apps. In most scenarios, the Outlook item is immediately created in Dynamics 365 apps. However, in some cases, Server Side Synchronization service is used to promote the item to Dynamics 365 apps and keep it synchronized, which may take up to 15 minutes. The below table provides a brief explainer of the behavior.

In most cases items are immediately tracked, aside from when an email is in compose mode and recurring appointments.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Server Side Synchronization is used to promote emails when Microsoft Outlook includes images in email signatures as attachments.

If the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook uses Server Side Synchronization to track an item to Dynamics 365 apps, the track status of the item will be “Pending”.

![Outlook app server side sync](../media/Outlook_app_server_side_sync.png "Outlook app server side sync")

   > [!NOTE]
   > For manually tracked items, App for Outlook only synchronize pre-definded fields between Outlook (Exchange) and Dynamics 365 apps. Any [Field level synchronization settings](/power-platform/admin/what-fields-synchronized-outlook) will have no effect while tracking the items manually from App for Outlook.

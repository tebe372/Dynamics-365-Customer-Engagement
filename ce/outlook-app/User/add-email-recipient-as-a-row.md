# Create a new contact, lead, or account row using an email address

Quickly add information for a new customer in Dynamics 365 using the customer's email address. 

When you receive or create an email or appointment for a new customer, use their email address to add them as a new contact, lead, or account in Dynamics 365.


1. Open an email or appointment.

2. Select **Dynamics 365** to open the **Dynamics 365** pane.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Open App for Outlook pane](../media/open-pane-appforoutlook.png) 
   
3. In the **Dynamics 365** pane, select **Add to Dynamics 365** (+) and then select **Add as Contact**, **Add as Lead**, or **Add as Account**

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   >![Add a contact or lead](../media/add-new-row.png)
   

4. Fill in the required informaion, and then select **Save and Close**. Or, to save and create another row, select the down arrow and then select **Save & Create New**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   >![Add a contact or lead](../media/app-for-outlook-quick-create.png)
 

If the sender of the email is unknown to Dynamics 365, when you add them to the system the email is automatically tracked in Dynamics 365 and set regarding this contact, lead, or account. To stop tracking, you can manually untrack the regarding email.

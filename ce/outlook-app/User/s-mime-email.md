# Track S/MIME signed emails

Dynamics 365 App for Outlook can track [S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/s-mime-for-message-signing-and-encryption?view=o365-worldwide) signed emails in Outlook Desktop and Outlook Web App (OWA). 

This is enabled on [Click-to-Run](/office/troubleshoot/office-suite-issues/office-click-to-run-installation) Outlook 2016 build 16.0.8730.1000 or later. To determine your Outlook version, go to **File** > **Office Account** > **About Outlook**.

Using encryption software with server-side synchronization is not supported.

- If you use server-side synchronization with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), you won't be able to view S/MIME encrypted messages. Encrypting emails with S/MIME requires an application to use an S/MIME control which server-side synchronization doesn't support. For more information on S/MIME encryption, see [Encrypt messages by using S/MIME in Outlook Web App](https://support.microsoft.com/office/encrypt-messages-by-using-s-mime-in-outlook-web-app-2e57e4bd-4cc2-4531-9a39-426e7c873e26?).

- Encrypted mails can only be tracked from the Microsoft Outlook Client (web or desktop) once they are decrypted, any corresponding Dynamics 365 activities created will not be encrypted.

When an email is signed or encrypted, attachments are stored inside a single smime.p7m attachment. If the email is tracked in Dynamics 365, you will see one .p7m attachment which needs to be decoded using an [S/MIME reader](https://www.microsoft.com/p/s-mime-reader/9nblggh5lhc3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

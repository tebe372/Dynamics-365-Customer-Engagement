# Use the assistant to gain insights and guide customer communication

The assistant keeps an eye on your daily actions and communications, and helps you stay on top of your day with insight cards to provide tailored and actionable insights.

The assistant delivers the most important and relevant information in relation to what you are doing right now. The assistant works by analyzing all of the data at its disposal and then generates a collection of action cards, each of which includes a message summarizing what the card is about, plus a set of links for taking action. The assistant sorts the cards by priority and filters them for your current context.

Some of what the assistant can do for you:

• Reminds you of upcoming activities
• Evaluates your communications and suggests when it might be time to reach out to a contact that’s been inactive for a while
• Identifies email messages that may be waiting for a reply from you
• Alerts you when an opportunity is nearing its close date
	

## Prerequisites

To use the assistant, your admin must enable and configure the Dynamics 365 Sales Insights feature. For information, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/ai/sales/intro-admin-guide-sales-insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/ai/sales/intro-admin-guide-sales-insights).

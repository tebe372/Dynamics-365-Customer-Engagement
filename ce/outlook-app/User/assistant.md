# Gain insights into your activities with relationship assistant

The  assistant is designed to deliver the most important and relevant information in relation to what you are doing right now. The assistant works by analyzing all of the data at its disposal and generating a collection of action cards, each of which includes a message summarizing what the card is about, plus a set of links for taking action. The assistant sorts the cards by priority and filters them for your current context.
Some of what the assistant can do for you:

	• reminds you of upcoming activities
	• evaluates your communications and suggests when it might be time to reach out to a contact that’s been inactive for a while
	• identifies email messages that may be waiting for a reply from you
	• alerts you when an opportunity is nearing its close date
	
When you start your day by signing in to Dynamics 365 apps, the assistant draws your attention to your most important items and tasks, drawn from all areas of the application.

# Track tasks to Dynamics 365

Track your tasks in Microsoft Outlook to your Dynamics 365 app. You can only track a task using category based tracking. For more information, see [Use Outlook category to track appointments and emails](/power-platform/admin/use-outlook-category-track-appointments-emails.md).

1. Navigate to your tasks in Microsoft Outlook.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Navigate to your tasks in Microsoft Outlook.](../media/go-to-tasks.png) 
   
2. Right-click on the task that you want to track and then select **Categorize** > **Track to Dynamics 365**. The task will be created in your Dynamics 365 when  the synchronization occurs.

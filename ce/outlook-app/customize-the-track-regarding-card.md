# Customize the track regarding contact card 

An app maker can modify the contact card a user sees when they track an email or appointment using [**Set Regarding**](user/track-message-or-appointment.md). 

To modify the contact card an app maker, needs to modify the **App for Outlook Contact Card** form.

In the example below, the **App for Outlook Contact Card** form has three columns titled **Job Title**, **Business Phone**, and **Mobile Phone** that are the same columns a user sees on the contact card.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Contact card example](media/sample-contact-card-columns.png)

If you wanted to modify the **Mobile Phone** column and replace it with the **Company Name** column, then you need to update the **App for Outlook Contact Card** form and modify the columns.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Contact card before customization](media/before-cust.png)

To modify columns that appear on the contact card, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

 
2. On the left nav, select **Data** to expand it and then select **Tables**.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Go to Tables in maker portal](media/maker-data-tables.png)
   
  
3. Select a table such as **Contact** and then select the **Forms** tab.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select the forms tab](media/maker-form-tab.png)

4. Select the **App for Outlook Contact Card** form.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select the App for Outlook Contact Card form](media/maker-outlook-contact-card.png)

5. In the form designer drag **Company Name** above **Mobile Phone**. It's important to note, that only the first three columns appear in the track regarding contact card. Although a related subgrid can be added to the quick view form, but it doesn't render within the **Track Regarding** contact card.


   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Edit the form and drag company name above mobile phone](media/maker-edit-contact-form.png)


7. Select **Save** > **Publish** and then close the form editor.
8. On the solutions page, select **Publish All Customizations** and then close the solutions page.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Publish customizations](media/maker-publish-customizations.png)


After completing the above, right-click in the track regarding card, and then choose **Refresh**. It will take a few minutes for the synchronization to complete and the changes to appear. Once synchronization is complete, the company name now appears at the bottom instead of the mobile phone number.

## Track appointments from another person in your organization

You can track appointments from another person in your Dynamics 365 apps organization using Dynamics 365 App for Outlook. To enable this capability, you need to enable the OrgDBOrgSetting in your organization. Dynamics 365 apps provides the OrgDBOrgSettings tool that gives administrators the ability to implement specific updates that were previously reserved for registry implementations.

1. Follow the instructions [in this article](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2691237/orgdborgsettings-tool-for-microsoft-dynamics-crm) for steps to extract the tool.
2. After extracting the tool, enable the *OrgDBOrgSetting TrackAppointmentsFromNonOrganizer*.

You can also use [this tool](https://github.com/seanmcne/OrgDbOrgSettings/releases/) to edit the *OrgDBOrgSetting TrackAppointmentsFromNonOrganizer*.

After the *OrgDBOrgSetting* is enabled, when you open Dynamics 365 App for Outlook on an appointment created by another user in your organization, you can track the appointment. You will no longer see the banner blocking you from tracking the calendar item.

## Synchronization and tracking 

The Dynamics 365 App for Outlook tracks and synchronizes your mail and calendar data between Outlook (Exchange) and Dynamics 365 apps. Server Side Synchronization is an asynchronous service that runs in the background approximately every 15 minutes to synchronize items between Exchange and Dynamics 365 apps. In most scenarios, the Outlook item is immediately created in Dynamics 365 apps. However, in some cases, Server Side Synchronization service is used to promote the item to Dynamics 365 apps and keep it synchronized, which may take up to 15 minutes. The below table provides a brief explainer of the behavior.

In most cases items are immediately tracked, aside from when an email is in compose mode and recurring appointments.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Server Side Synchronization is used to promote emails when Microsoft Outlook includes images in email signatures as attachments.

If the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook uses Server Side Synchronization to track an item to Dynamics 365 apps, the track status of the item will be “Pending”.

![Outlook app server side sync](media/Outlook_app_server_side_sync.png "Outlook app server side sync")

   > [!NOTE]
   > For manually tracked items, App for Outlook only synchronize pre-definded fields between Outlook (Exchange) and Dynamics 365 apps. Any [Field level synchronization settings](/power-platform/admin/what-fields-synchronized-outlook) will have no effect while tracking the items manually from App for Outlook.

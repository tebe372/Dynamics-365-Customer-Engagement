> In this article, we take a high-level tour of the schedule assistant. For a more in-depth tutorial, check out this [full video walkthrough of the schedule assistant](https://youtu.be/QOrePYZ9fds), which includes some practical examples.

The schedule assistant is a semi-automated feature in Dynamics 365 Field Service that helps dispatchers assign work orders and other jobs to the closest and most appropriate resources.

When triggered by a dispatcher, the schedule assistant will recommend resources that match relevant requirements, like time windows or skills needed. The system will also then show projected travel time for the recommended resources, which helps dispatchers plan work accordingly.

When the dispatcher identifies the right resource for the job, they can then book the work to the resource, who can then see it on their schedule.

In this article, we'll take a tour of the schedule assistant in Field Service.

## Prerequisites

The schedule assistant is a part of the Universal Resource Scheduling solution, which is included and installed with Dynamics 365 Field Service, Project Service Automation, and Customer Service.

## Matching requirements and resources

The schedule assistant's primary objective is to match up work with the right resources. In Field Service, work is typically represented by a work order, which includes information like:

- Location
- Time
- Territory
- Time windows

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a work order in Field Service.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-schedule-assistant2.png)

When a work order is created, a resource requirement is automatically generated. From the work order form, go to **Related** > **Requirements**. On the requirement, you can add more details about the work, like:

- Characteristics
- Roles
- Business units
- Resource preferences

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a resource requirement in Field Service.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-schedule-assistant3.png)

The schedule assistant uses these details on work orders and requirements to filter resources.

> ![Screenshot of a bookable resource in Field Service.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-schedule-assistant4.png)

## Trigger schedule assistant

When your work order or requirement has relevant details and you're ready to schedule, there are a few ways to trigger the schedule assistant:

- Directly from the schedule board, as seen in the following screenshot:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot showing how to trigger the schedule assistant from the schedule board.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-schedule-assistant8.png)

- From the top of the work order form
- From the top of the requirement form
- From the list after selecting a work order record

## Schedule assistant filters

Once the schedule assistant runs, the details from the work order and requirement are filters in the left pane. Dispatchers can fine-tune results by adjusting filters to meet their scheduling needs.

The filter pane includes work-related options, including:

- Work location
- Work start and end
- Characteristics
- Roles
- Territories
- Organizational units
- Resource types
- Resource pool types
- Preferred resources

### Location

Based on both the locations of the work order and the bookable resource, the schedule assistant filters resources outside of the defined radius, and then shows estimated driving time for each resource.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the work location filter on the schedule assistant, and how estimated time appears on schedule board.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-schedule-assistant-schedule-board.png)

These same travel time estimates are shown in the grid view of the schedule assistant, as seen in the following screenshot.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of estimated travel time in the schedule assistant grid view.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-schedule-assistant-travel-times.png)

## Rescheduling work

Need to rebook work? From the schedule board, just right-click the booked work, and then **Rebook**. This will trigger the schedule assistant.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board, showing the rebook option.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-schedule-assistant-rebook.png)

## Book the same work order again

You can also schedule the same job to multiple resources with the schedule assistant.

Trigger the schedule assistant for a given work order and book it to a resource's time slot; however, before exiting the search, select another resource's time slot and select **Book** again.

## Book entities other than work orders

You can book several other entity types via the schedule assistant - Dynamics 365 Sales leads, for example.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the option to Book a lead from Dynamics 365 Sales.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-schedule-assistant-book-leads.png)

For more information, see the article on how to [enable an entity for scheduling](../../field-service/schedule-new-entity.md).

## Multi-resource scheduling (Requirement groups)

Need a group of resources to perform work? Use the schedule assistant to book multiple resources at once using requirement groups. Go to the Field Service app, then to **Requirement Groups**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a requirement group detail page.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-schedule-assistant-requirement-group.png)

After using the grid format to create multiple requirements, select **Book** at the top of the form to trigger the schedule assistant.

The schedule assistant will find different combinations of resources that meet the different requirements and can all arrive at the job location at the same time.

For more information on setting up requirement groups, see the article [Multi-resource scheduling with Requirement groups](../../field-service/multi-resource-scheduling-requirement-groups.md).

This article walks through how to set up resource crews.

- [Resource pool scheduling](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/field-service/resource-pools): Resource pool scheduling allows you to assemble groups of similar resources to manage capacity and give schedulers the option to assign specific resources at a later time. This article walks through two common scenarios.

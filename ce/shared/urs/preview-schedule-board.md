The new schedule board is faster, with better usability, and it lays the foundation for new capabilities for multi-day scheduling and intelligent interactions.

### Performance

- The next generation schedule board is generally available. 

The new schedule board is faster and more responsive when: 

- Loading the schedule board
- Selecting schedule board tabs
- Dragging and dropping work orders
- Rescheduling bookings

### Usability and accessibility

The new schedule board is a Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control built on the Unified Client Interface, making it more flexible, supportable, and accessible. The new schedule board will work better on different screen sizes and across form factors. 

New color schemes and ways of depicting travel time make it easier for dispatchers to see statuses and details.

For instance, the previous screenshot shows a new "ghost booking" feature that helps dispatchers know if a booking will fit into a schedule before the booking is even scheduled.

### Foundation for new capabilities

The new schedule board provides the foundation for future releases that will provide dispatchers insights and recommendations to improve schedules.

## Prerequisites

> [!Note]
> The new schedule board is generally available in October 2020 (Dynamics 365 Field Service version 8.8.30.103 or later). More incremental features will be released in future updates.
 

## Enable new schedule board

Go to the schedule board and use the toggle button in the top right of the schedule board to switch between the current and new schedule boards.

## Daily view

The new schedule board supports a daily view of scheduled jobs and supports dragging and dropping to the schedule.

Scheduled requirements with a short duration will display across the entire day to make it easier to view details. Hover over the requirement or double-click to see the actual duration.

## Schedule resources

Beyond manual drag and drop scheduling, organizations using resource scheduling optimization can select one or more requirements from the new schedule board and either have the system **Suggest resources** or **Book resources**. This feature is currently in Preview for the organizations using Resource Scheduling Optimization.

> ![Screenshot of the suggest resources option.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-new-suggest-resources.png)

Selecting **Suggest resources** will display recommended resources in the right panel for the dispatcher to book.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the scheduling assistance preview.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-rso-1920-final-EDITTED.png)

Selecting **Book resources** will find the most optimal resources and book them without additional actions from the dispatcher.

**Suggest resources** and **Book resource** capabilities on the new schedule board are currently only available for organizations using resource scheduling optimization.



## Configuration considerations

- The new schedule board is currently supported on Microsoft Edge, Chrome, and Firefox browsers. Currently, Internet Explorer 11 is not supported.

### When to use the new versus current schedule board

The new schedule board is recommended for manual scheduling scenarios and for organizations that want to get up and running with a scheduling solution for dispatchers; the new schedule board is designed and built to deliver improved performance and usability. Users who perform drag-and-drop scheduling or users who only need to see the schedule board can use the new schedule board during preview. Also, organizations using resource scheduling optimization should consider using the new schedule board because the resource scheduling optimization capabilities are embbeded.

The in-market schedule board is recommended for more complex scheduling scenarios like assisted scheduling, multi-resource scheduling, using requirement groups, and so on. 

Use the following feature comparison table to understand which version of the schedule board is right for your business.

### Add new schedule board to custom sitemap area

When using a custom sitemap or an app module, you'll need to update the sitemap to consume the new schedule board preview.

The following snippet is what it looks like before:

```<SubArea Id="msdyn_ScheduleBoardSubArea" ResourceId="SitemapDesigner.NewSubArea" VectorIcon="$webresource:msdyn_/Icons/SVG/Calendar.svg" Url="$webresource:msdyn_/fps/ScheduleBoard/ScheduleBoard.html" Client="All,Outlook,OutlookLaptopClient,OutlookWorkstationClient,Web" AvailableOffline="true" PassParams="false" Sku="All,OnPremise,Live,SPLA">```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the sitemap before.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-sitemap-before.png)

The next snippet is what it looks like after:

```<SubArea Id="msdyn_ScheduleBoardSubArea" ResourceId="SitemapDesigner.NewSubArea" VectorIcon="$webresource:msdyn_/Icons/SVG/Calendar.svg" Url="/main.aspx?pagetype=entitylist&amp;etn=msdyn_scheduleboardsetting" Client="All,Outlook,OutlookLaptopClient,OutlookWorkstationClient,Web" AvailableOffline="true" PassParams="false" Sku="All,OnPremise,Live,SPLA">```
​

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the sitemap after](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-sitemap-after.png)

**URL:**

```/main.aspx?pagetype=entitylist&etn=msdyn_scheduleboardsetting```

**ID:**

```msdyn_scheduleboardtoggle```

## Additional notes

The schedule board is only supported in Unified Client Interface web (Field Service v8.x+) and not in tablets or phones.

### Uninstall schedule board

To uninstall the new schedule board solution ("Resource Scheduling Controls"), perform the following steps.

1. Go to the **Schedule Board Settings** entity customization form.
2. Remove the new schedule board preview control from the grid.
3. Save and publish the changes.
4. Go to the resource scheduling app, clear the browser's cache, and reload schedule board. The old schedule board will load without the toggle in the top right of the screen.
5. Once the solution is uninstalled, the new schedule board will not be available for the environment until you upgrade your Field Service app to the latest available version.

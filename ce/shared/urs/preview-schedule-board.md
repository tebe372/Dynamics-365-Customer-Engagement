### Performance

The new schedule board is faster and more responsive when: 

- Loading the schedule board
- Selecting schedule board tabs
- Dragging and dropping work orders
- Rescheduling bookings


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the new schedule board.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-accessability.png)

### Usability and accessibility

The new schedule board is a Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control built on the Unified Client Interface, making it more flexible, supportable, and accessible. The new schedule board will work better on different screen sizes and across form factors. 

New color schemes and ways of depicting travel time make it easier for dispatchers to see statuses and details.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of an outlined "ghost booking" to preview a schedule on the schedule board.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-drag.png)

For instance, the previous screenshot shows a new "ghost booking" feature that helps dispatchers know if a booking will fit into a schedule before the booking is even scheduled.

### Foundation for new capabilities

The new schedule board provides the foundation for future releases that will provide dispatchers insights and recommendations to improve schedules.

## Prerequisites

- The next generation schedule board is generally available. 
- Dynamics 365 Field Service version 8.8.30.103+
 

## Enable new schedule board

Go to the schedule board and use the toggle button in the top right of the schedule board to switch between the current and new schedule boards. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board showing the preview toggle in the top right set to "On."](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-enable-preview.png)

## Select and filter resources

Choose which resources should display on each schedule board tab.

Expand the filter pane and choose **Select Resources**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board, showing resources.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-select-resources1.png)

From the list of available resources on the left, move the ones you want to display on the schedule board to the right. Then **Apply**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the resources dialog on the schedule board in Field Service.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-select-resources2.png)

## Resource cards

Right-click a resource's name and then choose **View Resource Card** to see more, like the resource's skill set (characteristics) and roles. From here, you can also initiate a message, email, or phone call.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a resource card on the Field Service schedule board.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-resource-card.png)

## Map view of requirements and resources

Select the map icon in the upper right of the schedule board to display the resources and requirements on a map.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57967329/112584952-e7fb9e00-8dc6-11eb-8e0f-35462cef7225.png)

After expanding the map view, select a resource's name to see their route. The numbers indicate the order the resource is scheduled to arrive at each job (requirement) location.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57967329/112585093-2a24df80-8dc7-11eb-9a74-a55e953c956b.png)
 
At a zoomed out view of the Map, the requirements and resources are grouped together and a count of requirements and resources is shown. This enables to to quickly identify a geographical area with more number of unscheduled jobs and start scheduling the jobs to nearest resources in the area. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57967329/112587315-5e9a9a80-8dcb-11eb-9f9d-3bddf3587190.png)

You can drag an unscheduled requirement pin from the map to the resource timeline and schedule it to that resource. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57967329/112587585-d8cb1f00-8dcb-11eb-8555-6faacc9c39f3.png)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57967329/112587643-fac4a180-8dcb-11eb-8e82-f394d09df7a4.png)

You can also drag the resource route to a nearby unscheduled requirement to schedule it and add it to the resource route. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57967329/112588101-d4ebcc80-8dcc-11eb-8035-75f275ab5296.png)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57967329/112588115-db7a4400-8dcc-11eb-94f5-dc0444ab7ee8.png)

## Daily view

The new schedule board supports a daily view of scheduled jobs and supports dragging and dropping to the schedule.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the daily schedule view on the new schedule board.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-new-daily-view-schedule1.png)

Scheduled requirements with a short duration will display across the entire day to make it easier to view details. Hover over the requirement or double-click to see the actual duration. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the new schedule board showing another daily view detail.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-new-daily-view.png)

## Weekly and monthly views

Switch to the weekly or monthly views to see scheduled jobs at a higher level. Select a resource's time slot and a requirement below to trigger the booking panel.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the weekly of the new Field Service schedule board.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-weekly.png)

The booking panel will help you schedule a work order across multiple days and choose how the work should be divided each day.

## Schedule resources

Beyond manual drag and drop scheduling, organizations using resource scheduling optimization can select one or more requirements from the new schedule board and either have the system **Suggest resources** or **Book resources**. This feature is currently in Preview for the organizations using Resource Scheduling Optimization.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the suggest resources option.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-new-suggest-resources.png)

Selecting **Suggest resources** will display recommended resources in the right panel for the dispatcher to book.


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the scheduling assistance preview.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-rso-1920-final-EDITTED.png)

Selecting **Book resources** will find the most optimal resources and book them without further actions from the dispatcher.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the scheduling assistance preview showing suggestions.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-rso-suggest.png)

**Suggest resources** and **Book resource** capabilities on the new schedule board are currently only available for organizations using resource scheduling optimization.

Sometimes you might need to optimize only a single resource's schedule, rather than a set of available resources. Single resource optimization provides a quick way to reoptimize a resource's schedule and travel route after schedule changes have occurred during the day, which is now available on the new schedule board. You can right-click a resource from any schedule board view and select Optimize Schedule.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57967329/112586274-838e0e00-8dc9-11eb-9f74-bfc3d19f8d90.png)

## Move bookings to a new resource, a new start date and time, or both

With Field Service v8.8.39+, the new schedule board provides an easy way to reassign and reschedule bookings in the same action. Bookings can be moved to resources on the current schedule board tab or to resources on other schedule board tabs.

### Move a booking to a resource on the current schedule board tab, or change the start date/time, or both

Right-click on a booking and select **Move to**.

Then reassign this booking to any resource on the current schedule board tab, or change the start date and the start time of the booking. 

Select **Update** to apply the changes.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the move to option.](../../field-service/media/moveto-popup.png)

### Move a booking to a resource on a different schedule board tab, or change the start date or time, or both

Right-click on a booking and select **Move to**. Select the filter icon in the resource field and change the filter from *Resources on this tab* to *All resources*.

Now you can reassign this booking to any resource on any tab, and change the start date and start time of the booking. Select **Update** to apply the changes.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the move to with resource filter expanded option.](../../field-service/media/moveto-popup-filterexpanded.png)

## Automatic scheduling with optimization goals

The schedule board supports optimization goals. After selecting suggested resources, dispatchers can edit the optimization goal, which dictates how resources are recommended. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule assistant showing optimization goals on the schedule board.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-optimization-goals-edit.png)

There is a default optimization goal that applies to the entire system and serves as the default for optimization requests. Dispatchers can also edit the default optimization goal for each schedule board. Finally, dispatchers can edit the optimization goal for a single optimization request by selecting **Suggest Resources**. 

## Edit multi-day bookings

After a multi-day booking is created across multiple days, weeks, or months, dispatchers can right-click a booking, select edit, and change how many hours are assigned for each day, week, or month via a booking panel on the right. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a multi-day booking on the schedule board.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-edit-multiday-bookings.png)

## Configuration considerations

- The new schedule board is currently supported on Microsoft Edge, Chrome, and Firefox browsers. Currently, Internet Explorer 11 is not supported.

### When to use the new versus current schedule board

The new schedule board is recommended for manual scheduling scenarios and for organizations that want to get up and running with a scheduling solution for dispatchers; the new schedule board is designed and built to deliver improved performance and usability. Users who perform drag-and-drop scheduling or users who only need to see the schedule board can use the new schedule board during preview. Also, organizations using resource scheduling optimization should consider using the new schedule board because the resource scheduling optimization capabilities are embedded.

The in-market schedule board is recommended for more complex scheduling scenarios like assisted scheduling, multi-resource scheduling, using requirement groups, and so on.

### Add new schedule board to custom sitemap area

When using a custom sitemap or an app module, you'll need to update the sitemap to consume the new schedule board preview.

The following snippet is what it looks like before:

```<SubArea Id="msdyn_ScheduleBoardSubArea" ResourceId="SitemapDesigner.NewSubArea" VectorIcon="$webresource:msdyn_/Icons/SVG/Calendar.svg" Url="$webresource:msdyn_/fps/ScheduleBoard/ScheduleBoard.html" Client="All,Outlook,OutlookLaptopClient,OutlookWorkstationClient,Web" AvailableOffline="true" PassParams="false" Sku="All,OnPremise,Live,SPLA">```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the sitemap before.](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-sitemap-before.png)

The next snippet is what it looks like after:

```<SubArea Id="msdyn_ScheduleBoardSubArea" ResourceId="SitemapDesigner.NewSubArea" VectorIcon="$webresource:msdyn_/Icons/SVG/Calendar.svg" Url="/main.aspx?pagetype=entitylist&amp;etn=msdyn_scheduleboardsetting" Client="All,Outlook,OutlookLaptopClient,OutlookWorkstationClient,Web" AvailableOffline="true" PassParams="false" Sku="All,OnPremise,Live,SPLA">```
​

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the sitemap after](../../field-service/media/schedule-board-new-sitemap-after.png)

**URL:**

```/main.aspx?pagetype=entitylist&etn=msdyn_scheduleboardsetting```

**ID:**

```msdyn_scheduleboardtoggle```

## Additional notes

The schedule board is only supported in Unified Client Interface web (Field Service v8.x+) and not in tablets or phones.

### Uninstall schedule board

To uninstall the new schedule board solution ("Resource Scheduling Controls"), perform the following steps.

1. Go to the **Schedule Board Settings** entity customization form.
2. Remove the new schedule board preview control from the grid.
3. Save and publish the changes.
4. Go to the resource scheduling app, clear the browser's cache, and reload schedule board. The old schedule board will load without the toggle in the top right of the screen.
5. Once the solution is uninstalled, the new schedule board will not be available for the environment until you upgrade your Field Service app to the latest available version.

### Support for drag and drop to create bookings on Schedule Board

Drag and drop to create bookings on the new Schedule Board is not supported on Firefox browser. This will be supported in a future update.

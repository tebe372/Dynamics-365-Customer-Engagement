You have successfully enabled an entity for scheduling when:

- *Resource Requirements* shows as a related entity. Create them manually or with a custom workflow. <!-- needs a link to a new article about creating resource requirements --> 
- The **Book** option appears in the top ribbon of an entity record.

> [!Note]
> As part of the Field Service solution, requirements are automatically created when work orders are created.


<!-- section below is a customization story for the schedule board. needs to live in SB config doc 


## Add a requirement view to the schedule board

After creating a requirement for the lead, it will appear in the **Open Requirements** view in the lower pane of the schedule board that shows all open requirements related to any schedulable entity. This is a default view for resource scheduling.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the open requirements pane on the schedule board.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-enable-entity-open-requirements.png)

However, the views in the lower pane of the schedule board are simply system views and can be edited and added to. It's common to add custom resource requirements views for work orders (or leads in our example). Let's create a schedule board view that shows only leads to be scheduled.

Go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Entities** > **Resource Requirement** > **Views**.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the resource requirements views settings.](../../field-service/media/customizations-resource-requirements.png)

Create a new view and add fields to the view that provide details for what you are scheduling. Use the drop-down to capture fields from the entity (in this case, **Lead**). 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a list of possible entities, with "lead" selected](../../field-service/media/addleadentity.png)

Name the view using the properties or **Save As** functions. In this example, we will call it our new view "Unscheduled Leads." 


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the "View Properties" form with the name "Unscheduled Leads" populated](../../field-service/media/createview.png)
 
Most importantly, edit the filter criteria to show the appropriate records. To ensure only the lead resource requirements will be displayed, select the **Lead** entity and filter the records appropriately.  


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the filter criteria, with "Lead" highlighted](../../field-service/media/editfiltercriteria.png)
 
**Save**, then **Close & Publish**.  

Finally, we'll need to edit the schedule board we will be using in order to schedule the entity. 

Go to the schedule board and select the plus sign icon (+) to add a new tab.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the plus sign icon on the schedule board.](../../field-service/media/scheduling-enable-entity-add-tab.png)


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the add tab settings for leads.](../../field-service/media/newtab.png)

In the **Requirement Panels** section, add a **Title** and select the new view. 

Select the plus sign icon (+) to add the view.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the requirements panel section.](../../field-service/media/addviewtoboard.png)
 
Select **Hide default requirement panels** if you donâ€™t want to display the other tabs.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the schedule board with the new unscheduled leads view displayed.](../../field-service/media/scheduleboard-leads.png)

> [!Note]
> You may have many lead records in the system, but if there are no requirements related to the leads, then no records will show on the schedule board. Resource requirements will need to be created for each lead you want to schedule either manually or through a workflow to auto create upon creation of a lead.

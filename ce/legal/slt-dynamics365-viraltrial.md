MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS<br/>MICROSOFT DYNAMICS 365 GUIDES 
==================================================================

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or
one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft
services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are
accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms
apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to
pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU
HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

**1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.**

>   **a) General.** You may install and use any number of copies of the software
>   on Windows devices that you own or control in order to access and interact
>   with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides service to which you have access
>   rights via your company’s Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides subscription.
>
>   **b) Required** Microsoft Applications and Services. The software requires a
>   license to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides, which includes use and access of
>   the Microsoft Common Data Service and Microsoft PowerApps online services.
>   Use of those services may be available to you in connection with the
>   software, but your use and access to those services is governed by and must
>   comply with the separate license terms that apply to you through your
>   company’s subscription. Some functionality may require additional licenses
>   for other Microsoft software or applications. You will not be able to use
>   this functionality unless you have a separate license for such Microsoft
>   software or application.
>
>   **c) Third Party Software.** The software may include third party
>   applications that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this
>   agreement. Any included notices for third party applications are for your
>   information only. Even if such applications are governed by other
>   agreements, the disclaimer, limitations on, and exclusions of damages below
>   also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law.

**2. DATA.**

>   **a) Data Collection.** The software may collect information about you and
>   your use of the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this
>   information to provide services and improve Microsoft’s products and
>   services. Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product
>   documentation. Some features in the software may enable collection of data
>   from users of your applications that access or use the software. If you use
>   these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must
>   comply with applicable law, including getting any required user consent, and
>   maintain a prominent privacy policy that accurately informs users about how
>   you use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about Microsoft’s
>   data collection and use in the product documentation and the Microsoft
>   Privacy Statement at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521839>. You
>   agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy
>   Statement.

provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”,
“with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind.

**9. UPDATES.** The software may periodically check for updates, and download
and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or
authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with

services, or peripheral devices.

**10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may
provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire
agreement for the software.

**11. APPLICABLE LAW.**

>   **a) United States.** If you acquired the software in the United States,
>   Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and
>   applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws
>   principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims,
>   including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition
>   laws, and in tort.
>
>   **b) Outside the United States.** If you acquired the software in any other
>   country, the laws of that country apply.

**12. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.** If you acquired the
software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where
you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located)
govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all
other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort
claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software
in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you
and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court
in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and
Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of
King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.

**13. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.** This agreement describes certain
legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the
laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your
relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party
from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other
rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do
so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or
mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

>   **a) Australia.** You have statutory guarantees under the Australian
>   Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those
>   rights.
>
>   **b) Canada.** If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
>   receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting
>   your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
>   however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or
>   uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also
>   specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
>
>   **c) Germany and Austria.**
>
> >   **(i) Warranty.** The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
> > 
> >   **(ii) Limitation of Liability.** In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
> >
> >   Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

**14. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE
RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR
CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES
ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.**

>   content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
>   applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or
>   condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim;
>   in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.**
>
>   **It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the

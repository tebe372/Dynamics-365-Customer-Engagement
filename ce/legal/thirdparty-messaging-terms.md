**Supplemental Terms for Microsoft Dynamics 365**
**Connector to Third-Party Messaging Service**

Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) licenses this product or feature (the "supplement") to you. You may use the supplement with each validly licensed copy of Microsoft Dynamics 365 software (the "software"), or each validly licensed subscription of Microsoft Dynamics 365 online services (the "online service"), for which the supplement is applicable. You may not use the supplement if you do not have a license for the software or online service. The license terms for the software or online service apply to your use of the supplement.

**Third-Party Messaging Service**. The supplement interfaces with a third-party-branded messaging service ("Third-Party Messaging Service") through a Microsoft API connector. To use the Third-Party Messaging service with the supplement, you must obtain a license directly from the provider of the Third-Party Messaging Service. Microsoft is not the provider of, and does not manage billing or support for, the Third-Party Messaging Service. You will address all billing, support, and other issues relating to the Third-Party Messaging Service directly with the provider of the Third-Party Messaging Service. Your use of the Third-Party Messaging Service is governed by separate license terms between you and the provider of the Third-Party Messaging Service.

**Data Sharing**. By using the supplement, you consent to your data being shared with the provider of the Third-Party Messaging Service and to your data flowing outside of your organization’s compliance and geographic location boundaries. This includes Government Cloud environments.  You can find more information in the technical documentation for the supplement and the Microsoft Privacy Statement at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=512132](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=512132).

**Messaging Activities**. You acknowledge that you are responsible for, and Microsoft does not get involved in, the (a) creation of your message content, (b) selection of your message recipients, (c) decision on whether or when to send your messages, and (d) actual sending of your messages. Microsoft has no involvement in the foregoing actions, or your use of the Third-Party Messaging Service, other than providing you with the software, the online service, or the supplement.

**Acceptable Use**. In addition to the acceptable use provisions under your license terms for the software or online service, neither you, nor those that access the software, online service, or supplement through you, may use the supplement in connection with (a) an automatic telephone dialing system or other device with the capability to dial random or sequential numbers; (b) sending promotional or marketing communications; (c) expanding a transactional communication to include unconsented promotional or marketing content whether directly in the body of the transactional communication, accessible through a hyperlink contained in the body of the transactional communication, or via any other indirect method; (d) sending messages in a volume broadcast, including sending the same message or similar messages to multiple recipients within a relatively short period of time; (e) sending messages to recipients who have not first sent you a message or who do not have an open transactional matter with you; (f) sending multiple messages exceeding the express or implied scope of the end user’s initial consent; (g) sending messages to recipients without first obtaining prior consent from the recipient as required by applicable law.

**DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES**. IN ADDITION TO ANY DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES UNDER YOUR LICENSE TERMS FOR THE SOFTWARE OR ONLINE SERVICE, MICROSOFT MAKES NO REPRESENTATION AND PROVIDES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE THIRD-PARTY MESSAGING SERVICE OR THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY MESSAGING SERVICE AND THE SOFTWARE, THE ONLINE SERVICE, OR THE SUPPLEMENT. MICROSOFT DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF QUALITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

# Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Online Previews

Last updated: January 2020

Microsoft may provide preview, beta, or other pre-release features or services to obtain customer feedback ("Previews"). Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to these Supplemental Terms of Use, which supplement your Online Services Terms (governing your use of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online). If these Supplemental Terms of Use conflict with the Online Services Terms, then these Supplemental Terms of Use will govern.

PREVIEWS, AND ANY TYPE OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR PREVIEWS (IF PROVIDED), ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SLAS AND LIMITED WARRANTY described in the Online Services Terms and materials referenced therein. Previews may not be covered by customer support. At any time and without notice, Microsoft may change or discontinue Previews and choose not to make a Preview generally available.

Previews are subject to reduced or different security, compliance and privacy commitments. Previews are not meant for production use, especially to process Personal Data or other data that is subject to heightened compliance requirements, and any use of “live” or production data is at your sole risk. Previews are not subject to any statements made on the Microsoft Trust Center. Customer Data provided to Microsoft through your use of Previews may be transferred, stored, and processed in the United States, or in any other country where Microsoft or its subcontractors operate.

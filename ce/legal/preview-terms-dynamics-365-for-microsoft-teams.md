**3. DATA COLLECTION.** The Preview Offering may collect information about you
and your use of the Preview Offering and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may
use this information to provide services and improve Microsoft’s products and
services. Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product
documentation. Some features in the Preview Offering may enable collection of
data from users of your applications that access or use the Preview Offering. If
you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must
comply with applicable law, including getting any required user consent, and
maintain a prominent privacy policy that accurately informs users about how you
use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about Microsoft’s data
collection and use in the product documentation and the Microsoft Privacy
Statement at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521839>. You agree to
comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

**4. PRE-RELEASE PREVIEW OFFERING.** This Preview Offering is a pre-release
version. It may not work the way a final version of the Preview Offering will.
We may change it for the final, commercial version. We also may not release a
commercial version.

**5. FEEDBACK.** Because this is pre-release Preview Offering, you agree to give
feedback about the Preview Offering to Microsoft. You give to Microsoft, without
charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and
for any purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent
rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface
with any specific parts of a Microsoft Preview Offering that includes the
feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires
Microsoft to license its Preview Offering or related documentation to third
parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this
agreement.

**6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.** The Preview Offering, including its user
interface, features and documentation, is confidential and proprietary to
Microsoft and its suppliers.

>   **a. Use.** For five years after installation of the Preview Offering or its
>   commercial release, whichever is first, you may not disclose confidential
>   information to third parties. You may disclose confidential information only
>   to your employees and consultants who need to know the information. You must
>   have written agreements with them that protect the confidential information
>   at least as much as this agreement.
> 
>   **b. Survival.** Your duty to protect confidential information survives this
>   agreement.
> 
>   **c. Exclusions.** You may disclose confidential information in response to
>   a judicial or governmental order. You must first give written notice to
>   Microsoft to allow it to seek a protective order or otherwise protect the
>   information. Confidential information does not include information that
> 
> >   • becomes publicly known through no wrongful act;
> > 
> >   • you received from a third party who did not breach confidentiality
> >   obligations to Microsoft or its suppliers; or
> > 
> >   • you developed independently.

**7. SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The Preview Offering is licensed, not sold. This
agreement only gives you some rights to use the Preview Offering. Microsoft
reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite
this limitation, you may use the Preview Offering only as expressly permitted in
this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in
the Preview Offering that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not

>   • work around any technical limitations in the Preview Offering;
> 
>   • reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Preview Offering, except
>   and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this
>   limitation;
> 
>   • make more copies of the Preview Offering than specified in this agreement
>   or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
> 
>   • publish the Preview Offering for others to copy;
> 
>   • rent, lease or lend the Preview Offering;
> 
>   • transfer the Preview Offering or this agreement to any third party; or
> 
>   • use the Preview Offering for commercial software hosting services.

reference purposes.

**9. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** The Preview Offering is subject to United States
export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international
export laws and regulations that apply to the Preview Offering. These laws
include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional
information, visit ([aka.ms/exporting](http://aka.ms/exporting)).

**10. SUPPORT SERVICES.** Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to
provide any support services for the Preview Offering. Any support provided is
“as is,” “as available,” and “with all faults,” and without warranty of any
kind.

**11. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and the terms for supplements,
updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the
entire agreement for the Preview Offering and support services.

**12. APPLICABLE LAW.** The laws of Washington State, excluding conflicts of law
provisions, govern this agreement. If federal jurisdiction exists, then each
party consents to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts in King
County, Washington. If no federal jurisdiction exists, then each party consents
to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County,
Washington. If a party employs attorneys to enforce any rights relating to this
agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable
attorneys’ fees, costs, and other expenses.

**13. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.** This agreement describes certain
legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the
laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your
relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party
from which you acquired the Preview Offering. This agreement does not change
those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit
it to do so.

**14. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE PREVIEW OFFERING IS LICENSED “AS IS,” “AS
AVAILABLE,” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT
GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.**

**15. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR
RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER
FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. \$5.00. YOU
CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.**

**This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the Preview Offering,
services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or
condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in
each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.**

**It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.**

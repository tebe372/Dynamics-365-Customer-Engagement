On that context, some of the challenges that call center industry faces with the CTI systems are as follows:

    - Integrating third-party CTI systems into the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms.
    - Accessing and performing operations on the CRM from the CTI systems.
    - Developing and deploying CTI system needs writing adapters and complex custom codes for solution integration.
    - Using APIs and out-of-box customization which are not supported for production environment.
    - CTI systems dependency on the operating system and web browsers.
    - Customizing the CTI systems based on the business and process workflows.

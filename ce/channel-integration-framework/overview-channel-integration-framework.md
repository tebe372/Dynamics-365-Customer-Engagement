# What is Channel Integration Framework for Microsoft Dynamics 365

Channel Integration Framework is a cloud-to-cloud extensible framework to integrate third-party Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) systems with Dynamics 365 Unified Interface Apps using a browser-based JavaScript API library.

With this framework you can integrate any third-party channel provider or channel aggregators into Unified Interface Apps, where the Channel Integration Framework acts as an interface between the providers or aggregators and Unified Interface Apps.

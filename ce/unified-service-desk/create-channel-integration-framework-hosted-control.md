# Create a Channel Integration Framework hosted control
<!--note from editor: Please verify my edit to the title. It shouldn't be identical to the H2, and it should have the most important words in front (and in this topic, it seems that the escaping and encoding are the important ideas).-->
[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This topic describes how to create a Channel Integration Framework type of hosted control to enable the encoding and escaping of special characters.

## Enable the encoding and escaping of special characters

If a channel provider widget passes data that includes special characters to the Unified Service Desk client application, the special characters cause the Channel Integration Framework API calls to fail and the data won't be passed to the Unified Service Desk client application.

To pass data that includes special characters, use the **EscapeCharacters** UII option. This option is used for encoding and escaping of special characters when Channel Integration Framework API calls are invoked within Unified Service Desk. The option is enabled if it hasn't been added or its value is set as **True**. If this option is explicitly set as **False**, encoding and escaping special characters is disabled.

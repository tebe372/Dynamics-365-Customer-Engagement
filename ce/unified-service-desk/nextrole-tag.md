# NextRole Tag Unified Service Desk
The `<NextRole>` tag functions like the `<Next>` tag, but it applies to the accessibility role of the control. The attributes of the tag are same as the `<Next>` tag. The following sample finds a control one position after the second control with a push button role.  
  
```xml  
<JAccControl name="TestButton">  
<Path>  
<NextRole match="2"offset="1">push button</NextRole>  
</Path>  
</JAccControl>  
  
```

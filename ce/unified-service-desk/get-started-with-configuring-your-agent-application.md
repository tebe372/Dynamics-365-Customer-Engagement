# Get started with configuring your agent application
This section provides information on how to perform various tasks in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to configure your agent application.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] uses the [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] security model to govern access to the entities and configuration data. You can also create configurations in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to group entities, and assign them to users to ensure that they can access only the entities within the assigned configuration.

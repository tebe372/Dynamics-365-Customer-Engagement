# Listener Hosted Control (Hosted Control)
Use the `Listener Hosted Control` type of hosted control, introduced in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk_20](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-20.md)], to configure a custom listener for your auditing, diagnostic, and trace logs. The hosted control contains a reference to your assembly and class that contains the code for the custom listener. This type of hosted control doesnâ€™t have any predefined UII actions or events.  
  
 For information about creating and using a `Listener Hosted Control` type of hosted control, see [Use custom listeners for auditing, diagnostics and traces](../unified-service-desk/create-custom-listeners-auditing-diagnostics-traces.md)

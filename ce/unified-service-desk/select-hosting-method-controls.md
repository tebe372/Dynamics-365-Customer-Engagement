# Select a hosting method for your controls in Unified Service Desk

> [!Note]
>
> Starting 2022 release wave 1, Internet Explorer and classic Microsoft Edge browsers will be blocked from opening Unified Interface. This will let us further improve the experience by adding browser enhancements that aren't possible on these deprecated browsers. Leading up to the blocked experience, an error message will be shown to users of Internet Explorer.

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] offers you different browser controls for hosting your webpages. Select a browser control to host your webpage in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] from the **Hosting Type** list when you define a hosted control instance.

 ## Hosting types
 
- [Edge WebView2 process](edge-webview2-process.md)

- [Chrome process](chrome-process.md)

- [Web hosted application](web-hosted-application.md)

- [IE process (deprecated)](ie-process.md)

- [Internal WPF (deprecated)](internal-wpf.md)

- [Edge process (legacy - discontinued)](edge-process.md)

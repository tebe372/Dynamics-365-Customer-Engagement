# Migration steps of the configurations from Dynamics 365 Web Client to Unified Interface App

The migration of the Unified Service Desk configurations from Dynamics 365 Web Client to Dynamics 365 Unified Interface is a two stage process.

- Fetch and migrate the configuration elements to a **Data.zip** file using the Web Client - Unified Interface Migration Assistant.

- Import the **Data.zip** to the Unified Interface App using the Configuration Migration Tool (DataMigrationUtility.exe).

The diagram demonstrates the flow of the migration:

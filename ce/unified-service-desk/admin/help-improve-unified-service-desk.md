# How you can help improve Unified Service Desk

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] uses the product usage, health and performance data from the Improvement program to analyze and improve the product and service experience.

  
The information that [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sends anonymously includes:  
  
- Operating system version and bit type.  
  
- Web browser application and version.  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] version.  
  
- Number of monitors used and screen resolution of the primary monitor.  
  
- Device processor class and random-access memory (RAM) details.

- [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] application-specific information. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Telemetry data](../admin/comply-unified-service-desk-data-gdpr.md#telemetry-data)

## Help improve Unified Service Desk feature enabled by default

With the release of [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk-3-3](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-3-3.md)], by default the **Help improve [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]** feature is enabled for Microsoft Dataverse, and [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sends information to [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)].

> [!Note]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk-3-2](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-3-2.md)] or earlier with Dataverse instance, you must enable **Help improve [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]** by configuring the **HelpImproveUSD** global option and setting the option to **True**. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Enable sending improvement program information to Microsoft anonymously](#enable-sending-improvement-program-information-to-microsoft-anonymously)

During installation or upgrade, a notice about transmitting product usage and performance information to [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] appears as shown in the following image. This information helps us improve the product experience.

![Transmitting usage and performance information](../media/helpimprove-usd-install.PNG "Transmitting usage and performance information")


Configuring and setting the value of the **HelpImproveUSD** global option to **FALSE** disables data collection, and [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] won't send information to [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)].

> [!Note]
>  The check box in the **Help improve [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]** section on the **About** page reflects whether [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sends data to [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)]; an agent can't select or clear the check box. However, [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] administrators can control whether to send data to [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)].

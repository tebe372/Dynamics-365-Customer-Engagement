# Set default Unified Interface App using Unified Interface Settings

Unified Interface Settings is a new configuration element introduced under the **Advanced Settings** in the Unified Service Desk Administrator app.

![Unified Interface Settings](../media/usd-crm-unified-interface-settings.PNG "Unified Interface Settings")

You can now configure the settings like a theme, Unified Interface App, and assign users (agents) to the Unified Interface Setting record. After creating a Unified Interface Setting record, you can assign this record to a configuration, so that when the users (agent) sign in to Unified Service Desk client, the system authenticates the users straight away without showing the application selection window.

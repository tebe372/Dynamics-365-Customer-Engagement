[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] can help agents to recover the terminated (crashed) webpages hosted in Edge WebView2 Process in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].

By default, **Edge WebView2** process instance recovery is enabled.

## When Unified Service Desk can help recover Edge WebView2 Process instances

[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] can help agents to recover an Edge WebView2 Process instance in the following scenarios:

- When Edge WebView2 Process closes abruptly.
- When you manually end an unresponsive Edge WebView2 Process instance from Task Manager.

## Recover an unresponsive Edge WebView2 Process instance

When a hosted control that uses an **Edge WebView2** process browser control closes abruptly, the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application displays the message **Edge WebView2 Process closed abruptly**.


To recover the closed instance (which may contain more than one webpage), select **Reload**. After you select **Reload**, [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] reloads the webpage to the last known URL.


 The **Customer Service Dashboard** application is hosted using the **Edge WebView2** process. The Edge WebView2 process instance closed abruptly and selecting the **Reload** option loads the **Customer Service Dashboard** application.

If you don't want to recover, select **Cancel**. If you cancel, the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application skips recovery of the Edge WebView2 Process instance and displays a message, **The webpage stopped responding. If you frequently experience unexpected closing of Edge WebView2 Process webpage, contact your system administrator**.

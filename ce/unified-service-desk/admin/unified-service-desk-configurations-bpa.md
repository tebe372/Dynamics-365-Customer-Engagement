It is recommended you move Hosting Type of all the hosted controls of component type CRM page or Standard web application from Internal WPF to IE process.

### Mitigation

For all the hosted controls of component type CRM page or Standard web application, It is recommended to move Hosting Type from Internal WPF to IE process.

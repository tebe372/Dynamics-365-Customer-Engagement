## Hardware requirements for the Unified Service Desk client  
 The following table lists the minimum and recommended hardware requirements when you run the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client.

## Impact of Unified Interface Only availability with Unified Service Desk

You have deployed Unified Service Desk in a sandbox environment and when you reset the sandbox environment, you will have only the Unified Interface experience. To enable the Web Client experience, see [How to enable/disable Unified Interface Only mode](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/enable-unified-interface-only#how-to-enable-unified-interface-only-mode).

After you enable the Web Client experience, go to the Window Navigation Rules and update the navigation URLs for the all the rules.

## Software requirements for Citrix XenApp application virtualization  
 You can install and run the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client as a published app on Citrix XenApp 7.6. This allows agents to access the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client from a central location.  

 You can also configure a Windows application as a virtual application on Citrix XenApp 7.6 that run as a hosted application in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].

# Connect to a model-driven app overview
The [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client is the agent application you can use to connect to the Common Data Service platform instance where you have deployed your [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] entities and configuration data. On signing in through the client application, it reads the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] configuration on the Common Data Service platform instance, and accordingly exposes the controls and functionality in the application.  

<a name="Signin"></a>   
## Sign in to Unified Service Desk  
 If you want to configure the sign-in experience, such as pre-populate values in the sign-in dialog box or automatically sign in users without displaying the sign-in dialog box, see [Configure sign-in information](../../unified-service-desk/admin/connect-dynamics-365-instance-using-unified-service-desk-client.md#ConfigureSignIn).  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client by double-clicking the application shortcut on your desktop.  

2. In the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sign-in dialog box, provide authentication details to connect to your Common Data Service platform server.  

   ![Unified Service Desk client login screen](../../unified-service-desk/media/usd-login.PNG "Unified Service Desk client login screen")  

   - For the Common Data Service platform select **Office 365**.  

   - For Customer Engagement (on-premises) deployments, select **On-premises** and choose from the following **Authentication Sources**.  

     - **Active Directory**. Choose this authentication source if you are connecting to Customer Engagement (on-premises) internally through your network and do not connect to the Common Data Service platform through the Internet.  

     - **Internet-facing Deployment (IFD)**. Choose this authentication source if you are connecting to Customer Engagement (on-premises) through the Internet.  

     - **OAuth**. Choose this authentication source if you are connecting to Customer Engagement (on-premises) by using a security token service (STS) that is not [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Server](../../includes/pn-windows-server.md)] but supports the OAuth open framework.  

   - If you have multiple organizations, and want to select the organization where [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is deployed, select the **Display list of available organizations** check box, and then select **Login**.  

3. If you have multiple organizations, select the organization you want to connect to.  

4. The [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] splash screen appears. This screen shows information about the configuration data being read by the client in the background. Next, the main window appears and prompts you to enter your Common Data Service platform server credentials. Type in your credentials, and then sign in to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application.  

   Any time you start the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client and need to sign in again, you don’t have to provide your connection information again. Your credentials are stored securely in the Windows Credential Manager and other connection information is stored in the Default_USD.config file at `c:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Unified Service Desk\<Version>`, and used for subsequent sign-in activities.  

   If you want to change your connection information to sign in, select **Change Credentials** in the splash screen. You’ll see the initial sign-in dialog box where you can enter different credentials.

## Single Sign On for Unified Service Desk

Single Sign On (SSO) for [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides a improved startup performance and user experience by authenticating users to access model-driven apps without the need for entering the credentials multiple times. This eliminates the need for entering the same password again and minimizes the possibility of login errors and ensures seamless experience.

### Understand SSO for Unified Service Desk

While signing in to [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] you must enter the model-driven apps credentials and sign in, and again, you are shown a dialog to enter credentials to connect to the Common Data Platform server. To avoid entering credentials multiple times, the Single Sign On (SSO) feature is introduced.

By default, the SSO feature is enabled for the Chrome Process. With SSO, you need to enter the credentials only once while signing into [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application and the Common Data Service platform server.

> [!Note]
> - The SSO feature is available only for Dynamics 365 and Unified Service Desk.
>
> - If your organization has enforced the Inactivity session timeout for the agents, then with Chrome Process, the agent is not automatically singed out when the inactivity session timeout expires as SSO is enabled by default. If you want to enforce Inactivity session timeout for the agents, then disable the SSO feature for the Chrome Process. To learn more see, [Disable Single Sign On](#enable-or-disable-single-sign-on).

**SingleSignOnThreshold** is a UII option that indicates the timeout period in milliseconds for [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to wait before showing a dialog to enter credentials to sign in to the Common Data Service Platform server. By default, **SingleSignOnThreshold** value is 5000 milliseconds. To learn more, see [Manage options in Unified Service Desk](../admin/manage-options-unified-service-desk.md). The **SingleSignOnThreshold** UII option works only when you configure the **SingleSignOnEnabledBrowsers** UII option and specify a valid value.

To change the value, configure the **SingleSignOnThreshold** UII option and enter a value in the range **1000** through **60000** milliseconds. If you enter a value more than **0** or any value more **60000** milliseconds, then the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] defaults the value to **5000** milliseconds.

|Value in milliseconds | Description |
|-------|------------------------|
| **5000** | Default value |
| **1000-60000** | Accepted value range |
| **> 60000** | Value is defaulted to **5** milliseconds |

### Change SingleSignOnThreshold value

1. Sign in to the Unified Service Desk Administrator app.

2. Select **Options**.  

3. Select **+ New** in the **Active UII Options** page.

4.  Type **SingleSignOnThreshold** for the **Name** field, and type time in milliseconds for the **Value** field.

5. Select **Save**.

After you set up the above mentioned UII options, the SSO feature is enabled. While signing in to the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client application, you've to enter the credentials only once.

### Enable or disable Single Sign On

To disable the SSO feature, you must the configure the **SingleSignOnEnabledBrowsers** UII option and set it to **False**. If you leave the value bank, then the SSO is still enabled.
Again, when you want to enable the SSO feature, set the value as **Chrome**.

To enable/disable the SSO feature, follow the steps:

1. Sign in to the Unified Service Desk Administrator app.

2. Select **Options**.  

3. Select **+ New** in the **Active UII Options** page.

4. Type **SingleSignOnEnabledBrowsers** for the **Name** field, and type **Chrome** for the **Value** field.

5. Select **Save**.

## Configure sign-in information  
 If needed, administrators can configure the sign-in experience for [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] and pre-populate values in the sign-in dialog box (except user name and password) so users can connect to the specified Common Data Service platform instance, or they can configure it to automatically sign in users to an on-premises Common Data Service platform instance based on their [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] credentials without even displaying the sign-in dialog box.  

> [!NOTE]
>  You can’t add or remove the fields in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sign-in dialog box. You can only specify the values that will appear in the fields when a user tries to sign in. However, users can change the pre-populated values in the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sign-in dialog box before signing in.  

 To configure sign-in information, use the UnifiedServiceDesk.exe.config file that is available in the client installation directory (typically c:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM USD\USD).  

1. Run [!INCLUDE[pn_Notepad](../../includes/pn-notepad.md)] as an administrator.  

2. In [!INCLUDE[pn_Notepad](../../includes/pn-notepad.md)], open the UnifiedServiceDesk.exe.config file from the client installation directory (typically c:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM USD\USD).  

3. Add the following keys under the `<appSettings>` node in the UnifiedServiceDesk.exe.config file.  

   ```xml  
   <add key="CrmDeploymentType" value="<DEPLOYMENT_TYPE>" />  
   <add key="CrmUseSSL" value="<VALUE>" />  
   <add key="CrmOrg" value="<ORG_NAME>" />  
   <add key="CrmPort" value="<PORT_NUMBER>" />  
   <add key="CrmServerName" value="<CRM_SERVER_NAME>" />  
   <add key="UseDefaultCreds" value="<VALUE>" />  
   <add key="CacheCredentials" value="<VALUE>" />  
   <add key="CrmOnlineRegion" value="<CRM_ONLINE_REGION>" />  
   <add key="AuthHomeRealm" value="<VALUE>" />  
   <add key="AskForOrg" value="<VALUE>" />  
   <add key="CrmDomain" value="<DOMAIN_NAME>" />  
   ```  

4. Provide an appropriate value for each of the keys. Each key maps to an individual field in the sign-in dialog box. The following table shows valid key values.  


   |         Key         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

5. Save the UnifiedServiceDesk.exe.config file.  

6. Do the following on *each* user’s computer where you want to configure the sign-in information:  

   1. Copy the UnifiedServiceDesk.exe.config file that you just modified to the client installation directory (typically c:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM USD\USD) to replace the existing file.  

   2. Remove the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sign-in information from the roaming user profiles on the user’s computer. If the user has signed in to [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] from the computer at least once, the following files are created in the `c:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Unified Service Desk` directory: Default_USD.config and Default_USD. You must delete both these files for the configuration settings in the UnifiedServiceDesk.exe.config to take effect.  

   When the user starts the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] application on their computer:  

- The sign-in dialog box shows the values specified in the UnifiedServiceDesk.exe.config file, and also creates the Default_USD.config file in the `c:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Unified Service Desk` directory to store the connection information (except user name and password; this is stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Credential_Manager](../../includes/pn-windows-credential-manager.md)]). Thereafter, the client application uses the Default_USD.config file to display the sign-in information or to automatically sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  

- For a Customer Engagement (on-premises) installation with [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] authentication, if you have configured to automatically sign in the user without displaying the sign-in dialog box (`<add key="UseDefaultCreds" value="True" />`), the sign-in dialog box is not displayed, but the Default_USD.config file is created in the `c:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Unified Service Desk` directory to store the connection information (except user name and password). Thereafter, the client application uses the Default_USD.config file to automatically sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].

  If you need to modify the default sign-in information, you must repeat steps 1-6.  

<a name="LogFiles"></a>   
## Troubleshoot sign-in issues  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] provides logging support to log errors that can occur while signing in to the Common Data Service platform. A log file, Login_ErrorLog.log, is created at `c:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Unified Service Desk\<Version>` the first time you encounter any sign-in issues in the client application. Thereafter, the log file is used to record information about subsequent sign-in issues. This information can be helpful for troubleshooting issues related to signing in to the Common Data Service platform from the client application.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] also creates another log file, UnifiedServiceDesk.log, at the same location to log operational errors in the client application. The log file is created the first time you encounter any issues in the client application.

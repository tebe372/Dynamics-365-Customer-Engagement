# Unified Service Desk
 Use [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] to configure call center agent applications that provide customer service agents with immediate and unified access to business critical customer information stored in your [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] (online or on-premises) Customer Engagement instance and external applications.

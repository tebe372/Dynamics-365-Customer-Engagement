# Release history for Unified Service Desk
This is the release history page for the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] Guide.  
  
<a name="Release_3_0"></a>   
## Release history for Version 3.0, August 2017  
  
With [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] 3.0 release, we have integrated content for agents, administrators, customizers, and developers under a single TOC on our new documentation site at docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365. The new documentation site provides a seamless experience to easily find and consume [!INCLUDE[pn-unified-service-desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] (and other Dynamics 365 area) content for all the personas without having to navigate to different sites. More information: [Blog: New documentation site for Dynamics 365!](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/crm/2017/07/13/new-documentation-site-for-dynamics-365/)

Content for earlier version of Unified Service Desk continues to be available on [TechNet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn499779.aspx) and [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn864923.aspx).

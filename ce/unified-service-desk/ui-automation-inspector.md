# UI Automation Inspector in Unified Service Desk
The [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] Inspector is extended to support the generation of bindings for the UIADDA. This topic describes the logic used to build the binding.  
  
## Logic to build the binding  
  
-   Control Identification is based on the following properties:  
  
    -   `AutomationId`  
  
    -   `Name`  
  
    -   `ClassName`  
  
    -   `IsEnabled`  
  
-   Only the `AndCondition` grouping clause will be used for the generation, because specific properties are used for generation.  
  
-   The `MatchCount` attribute will be generated based on the necessity of the control binding.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `AutomationId` and `Name` properties are dynamic in a few applications and in few scenarios; in those cases, the property needs to be removed from the binding and `MatchCount` needs to be manually updated to set the bindings.

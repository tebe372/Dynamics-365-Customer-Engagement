## Hardware requirements for the Unified Service Desk client  
 The following table lists the minimum and recommended hardware requirements when you run the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client.

## Software requirements for deploying Unified Service Desk sample applications  
 To deploy a [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sample application, an instance of the Common Data Service platform (online or on-premises), [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2015](../../../includes/pn-crm-2015.md)], or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2013_sp](../../../includes/pn-crm-2013-sp.md)] is required.  

::: moniker range=">=dynamics-usd-4.1"

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Although you can deploy and use [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sample applications with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2015](../../../includes/pn-crm-2015.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2013_sp](../../../includes/pn-crm-2013-sp.md)], we recommend that you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2016](../../../includes/pn-crm-2016.md)] so you can use the new features available.  
> We recommend that you use Unified Service Desk 4.1 with [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-9-0-0-online](../../../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)]. [Get Unified Service Desk 4.1  now](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086721).

 For information about the sample applications available for this release, see [Deploy sample Unified Service Desk applications to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement server using Package Deployer](../../../unified-service-desk/admin/deploy-sample-unified-service-desk-applications-using-package-deployer.md).  

<a name="packdeploy"></a>   
## Software requirements for the Package Deployer tool  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_tool](../../../includes/pn-package-deployer-tool.md)] is used for deploying [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] sample applications. The tool supports and requires the following technologies:  

- For running the tool, use one of these [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Server](../../../includes/pn-windows-server.md)] versions: [!INCLUDE[pn_windows_server_2012_r2](../../../includes/pn-windows-server-2012-r2.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_windowsserver2012](../../../includes/pn-windowsserver2012.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Server_2008_R2](../../../includes/pn-windows-server-2008-r2.md)].

- An instance of the Common Data Service platform (online or on-premises), [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2015](../../../includes/pn-crm-2015.md)], or [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2013_sp](../../../includes/pn-crm-2013-sp.md)].  

- Additionally, [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../../../includes/pn-powershell.md)] 3.0 or later is required if youâ€™ll be using [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell_short](../../../includes/pn-powershell-short.md)] cmdlets for [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_short](../../../includes/pn-package-deployer-short.md)] to deploy sample applications. To check your [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell_short](../../../includes/pn-powershell-short.md)] version, open a [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell_short](../../../includes/pn-powershell-short.md)] window, and then run the following command: `$Host`  
 

## Impact of Unified Interface Only availability with Unified Service Desk

You have deployed Unified Service Desk in a Customer Engagement Sandbox environment and when you reset the sandbox environment, you will have only the Unified Interface experience. To enable the Web Client experience, set **No** for the **Use the new Unified Interface Only** option in the system settings. More information: [How to enable/disable Unified Interface Only mode](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/enable-unified-interface-only#how-to-enable-unified-interface-only-mode).

After you enable the Web Client experience, go to the Window Navigation Rules and update the navigation URLs for the all the rules.

## Software requirements for Citrix XenApp application virtualization  
 You can install and run the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client as a published app on Citrix XenApp 7.6. This allows agents to access the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] client from a central location.  

 You can also configure a Windows application as a virtual application on Citrix XenApp 7.6 that run as a hosted application in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../../../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].

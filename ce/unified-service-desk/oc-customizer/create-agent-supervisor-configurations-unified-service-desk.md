2.  Go to **Settings** > **Unified Service Desk**.

3.  Select **Configuration**.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  On the **New Configuration** page, in the **Name** field, type **Omnichannel Agent Configuration** and then select **Save**.

6.  Now, repeat the step 4 and 5 to create **Omnichannel Supervisor Configuration**.

# Use Web Hosted Application to host web applications

 The `Web Hosted Application` browser control is applicable only for the legacy `CCA Hosted Application` type of hosted control. This browser control doesnâ€™t provide native features of [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] such as events and toolbars.

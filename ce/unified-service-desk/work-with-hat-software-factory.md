# Work with the HAT Software Factory
The [!INCLUDE[pn_hosted_application_toolkit_hat](../includes/pn-hosted-application-toolkit-hat.md)] Software Factory provides tools for integrating applications and designing [!INCLUDE[pn_windows_workflow_foundation_wf](../includes/pn-windows-workflow-foundation-wf.md)] automations using the [!INCLUDE[pn_windows_workflow_foundation_wf](../includes/pn-windows-workflow-foundation-wf.md)] Designer. This section demonstrates how to use the [!INCLUDE[pn_hat](../includes/pn-hat.md)] Software Factory, a hosted application project, and the [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] Inspector to configure applications and create bindings.

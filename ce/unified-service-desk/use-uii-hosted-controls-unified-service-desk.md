# Use UII hosted controls with Unified Service Desk
[!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] hosted controls are user controls that are derived from the [HostedControl](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.csr.hostedcontrol) class, and  implements the [IHostedApplication4](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.csr.ihostedapplication4) interface, which provides most of the implementation code for a hosted control. You can override the functions in the [HostedControl](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.csr.hostedcontrol) class, as required.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted controls can be used to create new or advanced user interface elements with complex business logic to interact with external applications from within [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]. You can either create a Windows Forms-based or a WPF-based [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted control, and host it in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)].  
  
 For more information about the properties, functions, and events available for a UII hosted control, see [HostedControl](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.uii.csr.hostedcontrol).  
  
 The following walkthroughs demonstrate how to create a [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] hosted control, and use it in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)]:

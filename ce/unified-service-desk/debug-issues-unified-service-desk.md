# Debug issues in Unified Service Desk
The debugger application in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] is a hosted control that provides insights into the code executions of the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] platform. You can use it to troubleshoot issues in your [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] application.  
  
 To enable debugger, you must create a [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] hosted control of **Debugger** type. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Walkthrough 6: Configure the Debugger hosted control in your agent application](../unified-service-desk/walkthrough-configure-debugger-hosted-control-agent-application.md)  
  
 The sample [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] applications come preconfigured with a debugger hosted control.

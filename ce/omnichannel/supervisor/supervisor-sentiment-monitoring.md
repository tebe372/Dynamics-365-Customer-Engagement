# Sentiment monitoring

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Supervisor and agent sentiment notifications are not available in Omnichannel for Customer Service on Unified Service Desk.

Sentiment analysis enables agents and supervisors to understand real-time and historical customer sentiment across channels to improve customer service. Omnichannel for Customer Service uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to understand customer sentiments.

Sentiment intensity indicators are displayed based on the previous six customer messages received in a conversation. Sentiment intensity is scored in one of seven gradients: three positive, three negative, and one neutral.

| Sentiment | Icon |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Very positive | ![Very positive sentiment](../media/oceh/sentiment-very-positive.png "Very positive sentiment") |
| Positive | ![Positive sentiment](../media//oceh/sentiment-positive.png "Positive sentiment") |
| Slightly positive | ![Slightly positive sentiment](../media/oceh/sentiment-slightly-positive.png "Slightly positive sentiment") |
| Neutral | ![Neutral sentiment](../media/oceh/sentiment-neutral.png "Neutral sentiment") |
| Slightly negative | ![Slightly negative sentiment](../media/oceh/sentiment-slightly-negative.png "Slightly negative sentiment") |
| Negative | ![Negative sentiment](../media/oceh/sentiment-negative.png " Negative sentiment") |
| Very negative | ![Very negative sentiment](../media/oceh/sentiment-very-negative.png "Very negative sentiment") |

Omnichannel for Customer Service sentiment analysis supports multiple languages. Using Microsoft Azure Text Translator API, conversations in more than 40 languages now receive sentiment scores.

> [!NOTE]
> - Non-English conversations are translated to English, then scored. 
> - Unsupported languages don't receive a sentiment score.
> - If profanity is detected in English, the sentiment shows as Negative or Very negative.

To learn more, see [Explore Text Translator API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-info-overview).

## Personas

The multi-language sentiment feature (preview) supports the following personas: administrator, supervisor (team lead), and agent.

- If you're an administrator:

   - You can configure sentiment for English only and non-English languages.
       > [!NOTE]
       > Sentiment is enabled in Omnichannel for Customer Service by default.

- If you're a supervisor (team lead):

    - You can track agents' performance and engage in real time to continuously improve the support quality.
    
        Example: Identifying negative sentiment events, including English profanity, in conversations between agents and customers.

    - When you identify negative sentiment, you can provide timely inputs to help an agent resolve an issue.

        Example: Monitor and join the conversation.

    - You can identify which chat and text sessions are going well, and which might require monitoring.

- If you're an agent: 

    - You want to know customers' sentiments in real time and see customer satisfaction levels instantly as you communicate.

    - You can be responsible for handling multiple customer engagements at any given time.

    - You can engage directly with the customer to solve the customer's issue.

    - You can use analysis of customer sentiment to understand the severity of the problem, and take action. 

## Sentiment intensity indicators

Omnichannel for Customer Service sentiment intensity indicators are an automatic and unbiased measurement of a customer's satisfaction level in real time. These indicators show agents and supervisors how a conversation is trending, and give supervisors a real-time gauge they can use to decide when they need to step in and assist.

- For agents:

    Sentiment intensity indicators at the top of the communication panel help you understand the customerâ€™s sentiment.

    > ![Sentiment display](../media/oc-sentiment-sentiment-display.png "Sentiment display")

- For supervisors:

    - Sentiment intensity indicators identify ongoing chat sessions that need your attention, so that you can better assess and apply your time where it's most valuable.

    - Using sentiment intensity indicators on the Omnichannel Ongoing Conversations dashboard allows you to easily identify ongoing customer support chat sessions that aren't going well.

## Low sentiment notification alert

While an agent is communicating with the customer, and if the customer's sentiment decreases to or below a threshold level, you will get a notification. The notification displays the following details:

- Agent name
- Customer
- Sentiment
- Monitor button
- Ignore button


    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Sentiment notification](../media/sentiment-notification.png "Sentiment notification")

You can select the **Monitor** button to see the customer summary and the communication panel. If the agent requires help, you can join the conversation.

For example:

Administrator has set the threshold value as **Very negative**. When the customer's sentiment reaches **Very negative** or any other sentiment value below the threshold value, the notification is displayed to you.

## Multi-language sentiment limitations

Sentiment analysis relies on the initial customer messages in any conversation to detect the language of the conversation.  

Expect the following system behavior:

- If a customer's initial messages are detected as English, the system assumes that subsequent messages will be in English as well. If your customer switches away from English after these initial messages, the system doesn't perform language re-detection. In this situation, you'll most often see a neutral sentiment score throughout the rest of the non-English conversation.

- If a customer's initial messages are detected as non-English, the system performs re-detection and scoring for subsequent messages. If any following message is detected as non-English, its subsequent message will be re-detected and scored according to its detected language.

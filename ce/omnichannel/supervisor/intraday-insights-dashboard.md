# View and understand Omnichannel intraday insights dashboard

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The Omnichannel intraday insights dashboard provides information about the health and key performance indicators (KPIs) for your organization. This dashboard consists of two sections:

- [Conversations insights](#conversations-insights)
- [Agent insights](#agent-insights)

The information displayed in these sections are displayed based on the conversations closed in the last 24 hours and refreshes every 15 minutes.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Best practices should be followed to ensure that metrics displayed on the dashboard are not adversely affected. To learn more, see [Best practices to use Omnichannel for Customer Service](../best-practices.md).

## Conversations insights

The **Conversations insights** section provides insights on conversation requests that are generated in the past 24 hours with KPIs such as state of conversations and number of conversations.

The following screenshot is an example of the **Conversations insights** section.

> ![Conversations insights dashboard](../media/supervisor-conversations-insights-dashboard.png "Conversations insights dashboard")

This section of the dashboard consists of the following KPIs.

| KPI | Description |
|-------|-------|
| Average wait time per conversation | For a conversation, its wait time is defined as the cumulative wait times of its individual sessions. This KPI is calculated as an average that considers only closed conversations. Session wait time is defined as the elapsed time between the session's creation and the time an agent is assigned. |
| Exceeding 5 mins wait time | The number of conversations that are in an open status reason and have exceeded the time in the queue threshold of 5 minutes. |
| Average handle time per conversation | For a conversation, its handle time is defined as the cumulative handle times of its individual sessions. Session handle time is defined as the elapsed time between the session's creation and the time it is closed. More information: [Average handle time](#average-handle-time).|
| Exceeding 5 mins handle time | The number of active conversations that are exceeding the handle time threshold of five minutes. |
| Conversation by status | The distribution of conversations across open, active, waiting, wrap up, and closed status reason. |
| Open conversations | The distribution of open conversations in pick mode and push mode respectively. |

## Agent insights

The **Agent insights** section provides information on the latest KPIs, the health of queues, the status of agents on a given day.

An example of the **Agent insights** section is as follows.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Agent insights dashboard](../media/supervisor-agent-insights-dashboard.png "Agent insights dashboard")

This section of the dashboard consists of the following KPIs.

### Agent Performance

You can view specific insights about the performance of individual or groups of agents, such as their availability, average length of time in conversations, and average response time per session.

The following screen shows an example of the specific queue for a group of agents.
 
> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Agent queue](../media/agent-queue-details.png "Agent queue")

This section of the dashboard consists of the following KPIs.

| KPI | Description |
|-------|-------|
| Agent status | The availability status of the agent. |
| Conversation status reason | The status of the latest conversation between the agent and a customer. | 
| Avg handle time per session | The average handle time for an agent is calculated based on the active time the agent spends in a session from the time the conversation is active till it is closed and includes the time the agents takes to wrap-up. More information: [Average handle time](#average-handle-time).|
| Avg response time per session | The agent’s average amount of response time. | 
| Participation mode | The split of sessions which are of three types: Primary indicates the agent who's assigned to the session, Consult indicates agents who are engaged in a consulting session, and supervisors who are monitoring are treated as Monitor sessions. |

You can filter on a specific queue or set of queues to view more specific information about an agent or group of agents, and if needed, modify their presence. You can also hover over an agent’s name and a pop-up dialog will display, showing details such as the agent’s presence, their current conversations, and the sentiments of those conversations.

The following screen shows the options for viewing agent information in a specific set of queues.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]

| Available capacity | The current free capacity with the agent. |
| Total capacity | The total capacity configured for an agent. |
| Ongoing Conversations | All the conversations that are currently in active, waiting or wrap-up status reason. |
| Avg handle time (min) | The average of an individual agent's handle time in minutes for all closed conversations that the agent is involved in. More information: [Average handle time](#average-handle-time). |

## View and filter report

You can filter the information by selecting the Queues that are custom defined for your organization. To view the queues, from the **Omnichannel queues** dropdown, select the queues as required and the information is filtered according to your selection. This helps you in quickly analyzing the KPIs and take necessary steps to improve outcomes.

## Average handle time

The average handle time for an agent is calculated based on the active time the agent spends in a session from the time the conversation is active till it is closed and includes the time the agents takes to wrap-up. When agents are concurrently handling multiple customers, and switch sessions, the active time for the previous session is paused and the active time for the current session resumes.

If the agent spends time in providing consultation, it is included in the agent's average handle time. Similarly, for supervisors, the monitor time is included in the supervisor's average handle time.

The average handle time for a conversation is defined as the cumulative handle times of its individual sessions. The session handle times take into account only the active time of agents.

In a transfer scenario, the active time spent by all agents who are involved is summed up to compute the handle time for the conversation.

The average handle time will be accurately calculated if you ensure the following:

- Agents close the sessions by selecting the close button at the end of their shift. More information: [Conversation in waiting status](../agent/agent-oc/oc-conversation-state.md).
- Agents do not change the computer time.
- Agents do not use incognito mode in Google Chrome or private browsing in Microsoft Edge.

# View and understand Omnichannel Insights dashboards

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Omnichannel Insights  

The Omnichannel Insights dashboard provides KPIs and trends for supervisors to understand the overall state of the Omnichannel for Customer Service support experience at a glance. It also provides insights on the customer sentiments derived using support-specific machine learning algorithms with an ability to slice through different levels in the organizational hierarchy, which supervisors can rely on to improve the overall customer support experience.  

Typically, the overview dashboard is divided into two sections:

- [Omnichannel Insights dashboard](omnichannel-insights-dashboard.md#omnichannel-insights-dashboard)

- [Omnichannel Sentiment Analysis dashboard](omnichannel-insights-dashboard.md#omnichannelsentiment-analysisdashboard)

## Omnichannel Insights dashboard

The following illustration is an example of the Omnichannel Insights for Dynamics 365 dashboard:

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Omnichannel for Customer Service dashboard](../media/oc-full-dashboard.png "Omnichannel for Customer Service dashboard")

This section consists of the following conversation KPIs:

| KPI                  | Description              |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
|Incoming conversations | The number of conversations initiated by the customer.|
|Conversations engaged | Offered conversations that are engaged by an agent. Customer-to-agent communication can begin at this point.  |
|Average wait time (mins) | The length of time, in minutes, a customer is waiting in a queue. |
|Average wait time | Total length of time (in minutes) / Offered |
|Abandon Rate | The percentage of conversations that are not engaged by agents.|
|Average Handle Time (mins) |Average length of time an agent takes to complete a conversation with a customer. This time considers the time spent by one or more agents to help the customer.|
|Transfer rate |The percentage of conversations that are transferred to another agent/queue.|
|Average Customer Sentiment Pulse (CSP) | The predicted customer sentiment in a given timeframe for a set queue/agent, which indicates the degree of positive sentiment expressed by customers at the end of their interactions.|
|Average customer effort time |Average length of time a customer takes to contact support and complete a conversation with an agent. Only the conversations engaged by an agent are considered for this metric.|

## Omnichannel Insights for Dynamics 365

Omnichannel Insights reports provide comprehensive information on how overall support is performing across channels. The reports provide administrators and supervisors with a rich visualization and ability to filter across channels, queues, agents, and date ranges to better understand performance and troubleshoot problem areas.

The reporting structure consists of the following sections:

- [Conversations and channels](#conversations-and-channels)
- [Queue and agents](#queues-and-agents)
- [Bot insights (BYOB)](#botinsightsbyob)

### Conversations and channels

This section provides historical visibility into the overall support operations across various conversations and channels.
   
   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Conversation](../media/conversation-report.png "Conversation")
   
  
   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Channel report](../media/channel.png "Channel report")

The KPIs for conversations and channels are listed in the following table. For conversations, these are applicable to scenarios in which bots escalate to agents or agents directly handle customer calls. For channels, the KPIs represent support operations by each channel to help supervisors easily understand how each support channel (for example, SMS or chat) is performing, and take appropriate actions to improve the overall support experience for customers. <br> <br>

## Preview: Omnichannel Insights – Sentiment drivers reporting

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Topics are generated when chat transcripts from Omnichannel for Customer Service are analyzed and grouped together, and similarities are discovered among the conversations. These are then correlated with sentiment, so that supervisors can better understand how their customers feel about each topic on which they've interacted with agents.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Topics that affect sentiment](../media/topics-impacting-sentiment.png "Topics that affect sentiment")

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - The filters at the top of the report (duration, channel, agent, queue) don't have an impact on the topic-related tiles.
   > - This component of the report will display data only when sentiment drivers reporting is enabled and a minimum of 10 chat conversations per organization take place.


   |Tile             |Description                |
   |-----------------|---------------------------|
   |Grid             | Displays the discovered topics from the most recent 24-hour period in which chat transcripts were processed. |
   |Keyword          | Displays the keywords that are related to a topic.  |
   |Ribbon chart     | Displays the topics that have been discovered over the course of the most recent full week in which chat transcripts were processed. |


   |KPI             |Description                |
   |-----------------|---------------------------|
   |Impact           | Denotes the extent to which conversations related to a topic are driving overall sentiment up or down. This is determined by factoring out the sentiment of chats for the topic in question and comparing the resulting average to the overall sentiment across all chats. The difference indicates negative or positive impact on sentiment.  |
   |Volume  |Denotes the total number of chat transcripts that are assigned to a topic. |
   |Avg. Sentiment    | Denotes the average sentiment of chat transcripts that correspond to a topic.

## Sentiment zones

**Positive sentiment**

Positive sentiment is expressed by the customer writing messages that they're happy, pleased, or positive as a result of the support interaction. Positive sentiment requires the positive words to convey positive feeling beyond just simple pleasantries or politeness.

For example, when a customer writes "thank you," that's just being polite—it doesn't necessarily mean they're pleased or happy. However, if a customer writes "I can't thank you enough" or "thank you very much," that portrays clear positive feeling. Other examples of simple pleasantries or politeness that shouldn't be mischaracterized as positive are "Please help" and "Yes."

**Negative sentiment**

Negative sentiment is expressed by the customer when they're disappointed with the support interaction. These can be cases where the customer is describing a problem and is frustrated or unhappy because of how it's currently affecting them. For something to be scored with negative sentiment, the words need to clearly convey that the user is unhappy, disappointed, or frustrated.

**Neutral sentiment**

Neutral sentiment is represented when a customer's sentiment was neither positive nor negative. A customer's problem statement isn't to be scored as negative; rather, it should be scored neutral unless it contains words that denote emotion. This is true regardless of how severe the user's problem is. Messages with non-specific pleasantries or politeness are scored as neutral and not as positive.

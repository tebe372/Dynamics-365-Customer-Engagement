# Try Chat for Dynamics 365

Chat for Dynamics 365 is an engagement channel that will enable your live agents to connect with customers in real-time. Chat can be used only if you have an active subscription of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Service Enterprise or Customer Engagement Plan in your tenant. This topic explains the steps to help you sign up for a trial of Chat for Dynamics 365.

## Start a trial

1. Go to <https://portal.office.com> and sign in using administrator credentials. 

2. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase Services**, and select **Add-on subscriptions**. 

    You'll see the **Chat** option. You must already have a paid license of either Customer Service Enterprise or Customer Engagement Plan in your tenant, otherwise the **Chat** option won't be visible.

You can start a 30-day trial of Chat with 25 user licenses. After signing up for a trial, you must assign licenses of Chat to the users who need to engage with customers and provide support via Chat. This can be done by selecting one or more active users and editing their product licenses. After you're done, select **Save**.

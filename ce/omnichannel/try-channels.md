# Try channels in Omnichannel for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Channels, for example Live Chat and SMS, are the engagement channels that enable your agents to connect with customers in real-time and provide quick personalized help.

You can perform the following steps to try channels in Omnichannel for Customer Service:

1. Sign-up for a free 30-day trial of channels using one of the following options:
   - [Channels trial through trials.dynamics.com](#channels-trial-through-trialsdynamicscom)
   - [Channels trial through Microsoft 365 admin center](#channels-trial-through-microsoft-365-admin-center)
2. [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](#provision-channels-in-your-organization)

## Channels trial through trials.dynamics.com

With this option, you can get a free 30-day trial of Omnichannel for Customer Service including Chat, SMS, Microsoft Teams, and social channels through [https://trials.dynamics.com](https://trials.dynamics.com).

### Prerequisites

- You must have an existing tenant and not sign up for creating a new trial tenant.
- You must have an existing organizational account with the global administrator role to enable the trial. If you do not use global administrator credentials, you can join an existing trial organization with approval of the organization owner.

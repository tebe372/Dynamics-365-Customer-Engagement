## Pre-imported Unified Service Desk configurations in Customer Engagement organization

### Issue:

Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement organization that you create from **demos.microsoft.com** have pre-imported sample Unified Service Desk configuration.

If you import the Unified Service Desk - Omnichannel for Customer Service package without deleting the existing configuration in the new demo org, you see an error after signing in to Unified Service Desk client application. The reason for the issue is multiple sample Unified Service Desk configurations cannot exist in an Customer Engagement instance.

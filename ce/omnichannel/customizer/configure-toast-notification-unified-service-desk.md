## Steps for configuring toast notification

The process of configuring toast notification (floating notification) settings in Unified Service Desk involves multiple steps:

1. Create forms with notifications definition (XAML).

2. Create Hosted Control.

3. Create Action Calls.

4. Attach the Action Calls to Events

5. Add the Hosted Controls, Actions, and Events to the Agent and Supervisor Configurations.

<!-- Consider a scenario where you receive a case request. What is the interaction experience for this case request?

You see a toast notification for the case request. Therefore, the following events must be created: 

 - Create an event to open a session when the agent selects the toast notification.

 - Create an event and action when an agent does not act, and the notification hides after a brief wait time. -->

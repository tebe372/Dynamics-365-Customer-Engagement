# Customize quick view forms

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

You customize the quick view form in the section by navigating to the respective entities and quick view forms.

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure shows how to modify the **Customer Profile** section in the Customer summary form of the **Conversation** entity. However, the process is similar for other forms in the sections.

1.  Sign in to the Common Data Service platform.

2.  Go to **Settings** > **Customization** > **Customize the system**.

3.  Expand **Components** > **Entities** > **Account** and select **Forms**.

4.  Select **Customer summary**, which is of the form type **Quick View Form**.

5.  In the form, select the section for which you want to add a field, and then in the **Field Explorer** pane, double-click the field you want to add to the form. For example, double-click the **Address 1: Address Type** field from the **Field Explorer** pane. The field is added to the section.

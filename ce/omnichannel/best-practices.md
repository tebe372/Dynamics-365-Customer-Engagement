# Best practices to use Omnichannel for Customer Service

Here are the best practices to use Omnichannel for Customer Service, so that the data in the dashboards are not affected:

-  Agents must sign off or update presence before stepping out.

-  You must not create rules or manually route conversation which requires immediate attention to agents who are offline and away.

-  You must close the session once the conversation is complete with the customer.

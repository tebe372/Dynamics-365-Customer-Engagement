# Best practices to use Omnichannel for Customer Service

Here are the best practices to use Omnichannel for Customer Service, so that the data in the dashboards are not affected:

-  Agents should sign out or update presence appropriately before stepping out, to avoid requests to be routed to them.

-  For requests from channels that require immediate attention, routing rules should not be configured to assign to away or offline agents.

-  Close the session in the app once the conversations with the customer is complete. Closing a session ensures, you've capacity to work on the next conversation request.

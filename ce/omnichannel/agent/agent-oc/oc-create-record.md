# Create a record

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

When no records are linked to the conversation in Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can create a record. You can create a new record in two ways:

- [Create a new record from the Customer Summary page](oc-create-record.md#create-a-new-record-from-the-customer-summary-page)
- [Create a new record using the quick create option](oc-create-record.md#create-a-new-record-using-the-quick-create-option)
- [Create a new record using the + New option](oc-create-record.md#create-a-new-record-using-the-new-option)

## Create a new record from the Customer Summary page

In the Customer Summary page and on the customer and case form, you see an option to create a new record. When you select the **+ New** option, a corresponding form opens in a new tab. You can fill in the details and save the record and the record is auto-linked to the conversation. 

To create a new record:

1. Select one option in the Customer or Case section based on the record you want to create. After you select the option, a form opens in an application tab panel.
    
    | Option | Section | Description |
    |---------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
    | + New Account | Customer | Select this option to create a new account record |
    | + New Contact | Customer | Select this option to create a new contact record |
    | + New Case | Case | Select this option to create a new case record |

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Create account, contact, and case](../../media/oceh/customer-summary-create-record.PNG "Create account, contact, and case")


2. Specify the details in the form's fields.

3. Select **Save**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Fill in the form](../../media/oceh/customer-summary-create-new-contact.PNG "Fill in the form")

After you save, the record is automatically linked to the conversation. when you switch to the customer summary page, you can view the auto-linked record.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Automatic linking of the record](../../media/oceh/customer-summary-customer-card-linked.PNG "Automatic linking of the record")

If you create the account or contact first and then start to create a case record, the case form shows the linked customer's name in the **Customer** field who is already created and linked.

## Create a new record using the quick create option

Use the quick create (**+**) option in the nav bar to create a new record. After creating the record, you must manually search and link the record to the conversation.

To create a new record, follow the steps:

1.  Select the **+** icon to create a new record.

2.  Select a record type from the list. <br>
 - Case
 - Contact
 - Account

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Quick create record](../../media/oc-oceh-create-quick-create.png "Quick create record")

3. In the left pane, you can see a new record page. Specify the details in the form.

4. Select **Save and Close** to save the changes and close the form.

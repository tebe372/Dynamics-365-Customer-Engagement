# View communication panel

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The communication panel is where you, as an agent, interact with your customer. When you sign in to the application, by default, the communication panel is in hidden mode. You cannot view the communication panel unless you accept a incoming conversation to communicate with the customer.

From a conversation channel:

- You can send quick replies.
- You can search for and share knowledge articles with the customer with whom you are interacting.
- You can transfer the conversation (work item) to another agent or queue.
- You can use the consult option if you need help to resolve the work item.
- You can switch between internal and public mode to send messages to the internal participants (other agents and/or supervisors).

When you want to send messages only to the internal participants like other agents and/or supervisors, then use the **Internal** option. The internal messages are not shown to the customers.

When you want to send messages to all the participants in the conversation including the customer, then use the **Public** option.

# Use SMS channels

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Channels overview

When you sign in to Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can see your work items in Omnichannel Agent Dashboard. To learn more, see [View agent dashboard and agent conversations (work items)](oc-agent-dashboard.md).

## Prerequisite

Make sure your administrator has configured a Telesign or Twilio channel in Omnichannel.

### Incoming chat notifications

You'll receive a notification when a customer requests a conversation through Telesign or Twilio. You can accept the chat request, after which a session starts, and you'll see the communication panel in which you can exchange messages with the customer.

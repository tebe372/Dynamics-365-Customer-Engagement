## Overview

The personalization menu that is accessible through the app tab allows you to add personal quick replies. You can create quick replies to cater to the common questions and scenarios that you need to address in your role. You can tag the replies with keywords that help you invoke the quick replies when interacting with customers.

## Create personal quick replies

1. Sign in to Omnichannel for Customer Service, and on the home page, select **Open site map item in a new tab**.
2. Select **Personalization**. The **Personalization User settings** page appears.
3. On the **Personal quick replies** tab, select **New Personal quick reply**, and do the following:
    - **Message:** Enter the quick reply text.
    - **Locale:** Select the language in which you want to create the quick reply.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Omnichannel for Customer Service does not localize quick responses. To provide quick responses in multiple languages, create a separate quick response record for each language and select its corresponding locale.

4. Select **Save**.

## Introduction

You can personalize agent settings for sound notifications and quick replies using the personalization menu available on the application tab panel. The personalize options are available only when they are enabled by your administrator.

As an agent, you can personalize the sounds that can be played for incoming conversation notifications and messages. The personalized settings have precedence over the administrator settings.

1. On the application tab panel, select the plus icon, and select **Personalization**. The **Personalization User settings** page appears.
2. Select **Sound Settings**.
3. You can personalize the following settings for the channels that are provisioned in the environment:
   -  Enable Sound
   -  Loop
   -  Notification Sound
   -  Volume
4. Select **Save**.

## Agent dashboard for Teams channel

When you sign in to Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can see your work items on the Omnichannel Agent Dashboard. More information: [View agent dashboard and agent conversations](oc-agent-dashboard.md)

## Prerequisite

Make sure that your administrator has configured a Teams channel.

## Incoming Teams chat notification

You'll receive a notification when a customer requests a conversation through Teams. When you accept the Teams chat request, a session is started, and you'll see the communication panel in which you can exchange messages with the customer.

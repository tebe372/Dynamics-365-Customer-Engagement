# Use productivity pane to guide agents

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The productivity pane in Omnichannel for Customer Service displays the **Agent Guidance** control (agent scripts and smart-assist cards) in a unified view.

The productivity pane is unique to each session, and when you switch to another session, the context changes according to session.

Also, the modes are preserved in different sessions. For example, in session A, you've expanded the pane, while in session B, you've collapsed the pane. When you switch from session A  to session B, the pane mode changes from expanded to collapsed. Now, when you switch back to session A, then the pane will be in expanded mode.

Use the arrow to set the mode of the productivity pane.

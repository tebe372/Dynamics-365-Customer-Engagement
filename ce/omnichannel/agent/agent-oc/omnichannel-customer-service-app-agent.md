# Agents using Omnichannel for Customer Service app

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Overview

The Omnichannel for Customer Service application on a web browser provides a unified and consistent single-view experience for the agents to view conversation details, Customer information, and access Line-of-Business applications from within the Omnichannel for Customer Service app. 
As an agent, you can use the app to manage the work items assigned, simultaneous customer sessions without losing the context of each session. You view the holistic data of the customer with the details of their previous interaction, which ensures you have all the available information to resolve the customer issue.

> 
> - As of now, administrators or system cutomizers can't integrate third-party channels with Omnichannel for Customer Service app.

# Use a WeChat channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Agent dashboard for WeChat channel

When you sign in to the Omnichannel Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, you can see your work items on the Omnichannel Agent Dashboard. More information: [View agent dashboard and agent conversations](oc-agent-dashboard.md)

## Prerequisites

Make sure that your administrator has configured a WeChat channel.

## Incoming WeChat chat notification

You'll receive a notification when a customer requests a conversation through WeChat. When you accept the WeChat chat request, a session is started and you'll see the communication panel in which you can exchange messages with the customer.

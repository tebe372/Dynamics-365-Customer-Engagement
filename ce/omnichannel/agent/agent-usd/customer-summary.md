# View customer summary and know everything about customers

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Overview of the existing challenges

One of the major challenges that customers face when contacting customer support is providing repetitive information about the issue with the support agent. Also, if the customer wants to review the status of the request raised at a later stage, the customer shares the same information with another support agent to explain the context of the conversation. To avoid this situation, the support agent must access the customer information with details about the product/service, issue, cases history, related cases, location, and so on.

By having this information ready, when customers reach out to contact center, support agents can help reduce the hold time that they spend retrieving customer information, reduce average handling time (AHT), and increase customer satisfaction through faster resolution of the issue.

## What is Customer summary?

**Customer summary** is a page where you can get complete information about a customer when you accept an incoming request from any engagement channel. The default view of the **Customer summary** page provides the following sections:

   - Customer

   - Conversation summary

   - Case

   - Recent cases

   - Timeline

# View customer summary for an incoming conversation request

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

## Scenario 1: Incoming conversation request for an existing customer record that already has a case in Omnichannel for Customer Service  

When you receive an incoming conversation request, you see a notification (screen pop) that contains contextual information for the request. When you accept or select the notification, the **Customer summary** page appears. This page shows the details of the customer and case.

## Scenario 2: Incoming conversation request where you find several customer records in the Omnichannel for Customer Service 

When you receive an incoming conversation request, you see a notification (screen pop) that contains contextual information for the request. Omnichannel for Customer Service shows the following message: **One or more records found. Select a record or create new**.
### Select a record

If you select a case, the contact or account opens the **Customer summary** page by prepopulating the details.

If you select a contact or account, the **Customer summary** page is refreshed, and the **Issue Snapshot** section is updated with the current case details.

If you select a case that differs from the case that is assigned to you, you receive a warning message and must link the conversation to the record.

### Create a record

You can create a contact or account by using the quick create option. After you create the record, the case is automatically linked to the conversation. However, no records are present in Omnichannel for Customer Service, based on the contextual information that is obtained from the notifications (screen pops).

However, there are no records present in Omnichannel for Customer Service based on the contextual information obtained from the notification (screen pop).

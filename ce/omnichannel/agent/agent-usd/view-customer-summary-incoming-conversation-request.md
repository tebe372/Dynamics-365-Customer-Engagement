# View customer summary for an incoming conversation request

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Scenario 1: Incoming conversation request for an existing customer record  

When you receive an incoming conversation request, you see a notification and accept the request, a session starts and the **Customer summary** page appears with the details of the customer and case.

## Scenario 2: Incoming conversation request with an associated record

When you get an incoming conversation request, you see a notification and accept the request. However, if there are no records present in Omnichannel for Customer Service based on the incoming conversation request, you can create a record. To learn more see, [Create a record](create-record.md), [Search a record](search-record.md),  and [Link a record](link-unlink-record.md).

# Configure proactive chat

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

A chat channel allows your customers to engage with customer service agents using the chat widget on a website. Proactive chat allows customer service agents to engage with customers by automatically inviting them to a chat conversation based on the configured rules. Proactively engaging with a customer at the time when they need help improves customer experience and satisfaction.

Information about the user journey, time spent on a web page, and more can be used to decide when to engage with a customer. You can control the proactive chat experience by using personalized trigger messages and configurable rules to define the target audience, time frame, and target location.

> [!NOTE]
> Proactive chat can be triggered only on pages where the chat widget is embedded.

## Enable proactive chat

1.	Sign in to Omnichannel Administration.
2.	Open the chat widget for which you need to turn on proactive chat.
3.	Go to the **Basic details** tab.
4.	Under **Proactive chat**, select **Yes** for **Enable Proactive Chat**. By default, it is set to **No**.

    > ![Enable proactive chat](../media/proactive-chat.png "Enable proactive chat")

The conditions to trigger the proactive chat are defined in the web page code in which the chat widget is embedded. If the conditions are fulfilled, the proactive chat invitation is displayed with the help of an API.

## Customer experience of proactive chat

When proactive chat is enabled, the chat invitation is displayed to customers based on the configured triggers.

> ![Proactive chat notification](../media/proactive-chat-invite.png "Proactive chat notification")

A customer can choose to accept the chat invitation or close it. The chat invitation closes automatically after one minute if the customer does not accept it.

> [!NOTE]
> For this release, the timer of one minute is not configurable.

## Agent experience of proactive chat

When a customer accepts the proactive chat invitation, an agent receives the notification.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Proactive chat agent notification](../media/proactive-chat-agent.png "Proactive chat agent notification")

The agent then accepts the chat request and starts conversing with the customer to provide the required help. The [customer summary](../agent/agent-oc/oc-customer-summary.md) is loaded and displayed if the customerâ€™s details match the stored data. 

If your administrator or developer configures the **Additional details** tab and if there are additional context variables, such as time spent on a page and the page URL from where the chat is initiated, they are displayed on the **Additional details** tab.

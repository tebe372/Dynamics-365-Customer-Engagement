# Configure Omnichannel Insights dashboards

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Customer service managers or supervisors are responsible for managing agents who work to resolve customer queries every day through various service channels. They need to know key operational metrics to ensure that their agents are providing quality support. Omnichannel Insights consists of channels and sentiment analysis dashboards that can help with this.

### Step 1: Review prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites before configuring the dashboard:
-  You have administrative privileges for Dynamics 365 Customer Service and Power BI.
-  You have a Power BI Pro license for all supervisors.
-  You must enable embedding of Power BI reports in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.
    1.	Sign in to **Dynamics 365 Customer Service** and go to **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings**.
    2.	Go to the **Reporting** tab and select **Yes** for **Allow Power BI visualization embedding**.

      > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
      > ![Enable Power BI visualization embedding](../media/supervisor-admin-enable-powerbi.png "Enable Power BI visualization embedding")

    3.	Select **OK**.

### Step 2A: Install Omnichannel Insights for Dynamics 365 app

1.	Sign in to the [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/) app as an administrator.

2.	As a Power BI administrator, open the [Omnichannel Insights for Dynamics 365](http://aka.ms/d365-oc-insights) app page.

3.  Select **GET IT NOW** to install the app.

4.	After the **Omnichannel Insights** app is installed, select the app and the configuration options page will be displayed.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Omnichannel Insights configuration page](../media/supervisor-admin-historical-configuration-page-doi.png "Omnichannel Insights configuration page")

    Proceed to configure the app by connecting your organization.

### Step 2B: Configure existing Omnichannel Insights for Dynamics 365 app

If a previous version of Omnichannel Insights was installed, we strongly recommend that you install the latest version of Omnichannel Insights to avoid losing any customization. 

1. During the Omnichannel Insights app installation, the following appears:

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Enter CRM OData feed URL](../media/oc-config1.png "Enter CRM OData feed URL")


2. Choose the **Install to a new workspace** option.
3. Select **Install**.
4. Reimplement customizations into the new workspace.


### Step 3: Connect to Omnichannel Insights for Dynamics 365 app

1.	On the **Omnichannel Insights for Dynamics 365** app configuration page, select **Connect**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select Connect on configuration page](../media/supervisor-admin-historical-select-connect-data.png "Select Connect on configuration page")

2.	On the connect data page, enter your organization's CRM OData feed URL and select **Next**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Enter CRM OData feed URL](../media/oc-config2.png "Enter CRM OData feed URL")

3.	(Optional) To find the Microsoft Dynamics 365 OData URL, follow these steps:

    a.	Sign in to Dynamics 365 Customer Service.
    
    b.	Go to **Settings** > **Customizations** and then select **Developer Resources**. 
    
    c.	Find the OData URL under **Service Root URL**.

       > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
       > ![Get CRM OData feed URL](../media/oc-config3.png "Get CRM OData feed URL")

4.	Select **Authentication method** as **OAuth2** and **Privacy level** as **Organizational**. Select **Sign in**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Enter authentication and privacy level](../media/oc-config4.png "Enter authentication and privacy level")

5.	Enter your Dynamics 365 Customer Service credentials and select **Enter**.

    When you are signed in, the existing report is updated with the data from your organization.


### Step 4: Configure refresh frequency on Power BI dataset

After you connect the Dynamics 365 Omnichannel Insights app with a Dynamics 365 organization, you need to configure the refresh frequency on the Power BI dataset so reports and dashboards refresh properly.

1.	Sign in to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/) as an administrator.

2.	Go to the **Omnichannel Insights** app workspace.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select Power BI workspace](../media/supervisor-admin-historical-powerbi-workspace.png "Select Power BI workspace")

3.	On the **Datasets** tab, select **Settings**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select Settings on Datasets tab](../media/oc-config5.png "Select Settings on Datasets tab")

4.	Turn **Scheduled refresh** to **On**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Turn on Scheduled refresh](../media/oc-config6.png "Turn on Scheduled refresh")

    > [!NOTE]
    > We recommend that you set the refresh frequency to **Daily**.

5. Select **Apply**.

Omnichannel Insights reports and dashboards will refresh daily. 

### Step 5: Publish application within your organization

You must share the configured application with your entire organization for supervisors to view the **Omnichannel Insights** dashboards and reports with their own **Power BI Pro** accounts.

1.	On the App workspace, select **Update app** to open the Update app wizard. 

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select Update app](../media/oc-config7.png "Select Update app")

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Make selections in the Workspace and Dashboard fields](../media/oc-config14.PNG "Make selections in the Workspace and Dashboard fields")

5.	Save and close.

6.	Repeat Steps 3â€“5 to add Omnichannel Insights - Sentiment Analysis dashboard.

## Customize Omnichannel Insights

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft does not support customizations made to the Power BI template app and does not provide updates once modifications are made. 

Power BI is a comprehensive collection of services and tools that are used to visualize business data. The Power BI Template apps make it easy to visualize and analyze the Omnichannel Insights data with Power BI based on a standard data model. 

The Omnichannel Insights template app is built with a set of entities and fields that are useful for most reporting scenarios. Dynamics 365 apps are often extended with custom fields. These custom fields donâ€™t automatically show up in the Power BI model. 

The following shows you how edit and extend the report included in the template app to include custom fields in the Power BI model.

Before customizing the template app, read the following information and perform each task as necessary.

## Requirements

1. [Power BI service registration.](https://app.powerbi.com/)
2. [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) application for editing Power BI reports.
3. Power BI report for Omnichannel Insights template app that you want to customize. [Download the Omnichannel Insights report.](https://aka.ms/OC-Insights-pbix)

## Prepare PBIX for customization

1. Start Power BI Desktop.

2. Select **File** > **Open**, open Omnichannel Insights for Dynamics 365.pbix, and then select **Open**.

   Several pages of reports are loaded and displayed in Power BI Desktop.

4.	On the Power BI Desktop ribbon, select **Edit Queries**.

5. In the left navigation pane of the Edit Queries window, under **Queries**, select the **Dynamics 365 Service Root URL** query.

6. In the ribbon, select **Advanced Editor**.

7. In the source definition, replace **contosuites.crm10.dynamics.com** with your apps instance URL.

    Example: if the organization name is Contoso, the URL looks like this:
    Source = https://contoso.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.1/

8. Select **Done**.

9. Select **Close & Apply** in Query Editor.

10.	When the 'Access an OData feed' appears, select **Organizational account**.

11.  Select **Sign in**.

     > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
     > ![Add user to supervisor configuration](../media/oc-config17.PNG "Add user to supervisor configuration")

12.	When the sign-in field appears, enter your credentials to authenticate to your instance.

13.	In the **Access an OData feed** dialog, select **Connect**.

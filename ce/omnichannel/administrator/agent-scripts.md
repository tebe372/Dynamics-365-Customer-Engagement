## Overview of agent scripts

In the customer service industry, agents need to deal with continuous updates both in the product and processes. Even after rigorous training of agents, recurrent human errors and delays in service delivery occur due to a lack of guidance in real-time customer scenarios. These issues lead to lower productivity and thus impact customer satisfaction levels. To avoid errors and ensure adherence to processes, agents need guidance.

Agent scripts provide guidance to agents about what to do when they get a customer issue. The scripts ensure that only accurate, company-endorsed information is being shared, while also safeguarding the organization in regard to legal-compliance issues. Agent scripts help organizations to be unified, accurate, and effective while also being faster and more efficient in terms of customer handling.

The agent scripts reduce the human errors involved in the process as the agents know the next actions they need to perform while interacting with a customer, which enables them to adhere to business process. The option, in turn, leads the agents to provide a quick resolution to the issue (low average handling time) and improve customer satisfaction.

## Value propositions

- Minimization of human errors.

- Adherence to business processes.

- Lower Average Handling Time.

- Improved customer satisfaction.

## Prerequisites

- Install Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools solution.

- Ensure you have the **Productivity tools administrator** security role. To learn more, see [Assign roles and enable users](add-users-assign-roles.md).

- Ensure agents and supervisors are assigned **Productivity tools user** security role. To learn more, see [Assign roles and enable users](add-users-assign-roles.md).

The agent script is associated with the session template.

## Step 3: Add agent script control to a form

After you create an agent script, you must add the agent script field to the form where you want agents to see it.

    > ![Add name and show label](../media/agent-script-control8.png "Add name and show label")

9. Select a field of type **Text** from **Field Explorer**. For example, the **Title** field is of type **Text**. If you hover the cursor on a field, you can view the type.

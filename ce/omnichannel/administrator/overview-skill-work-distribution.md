# Overview of skill-based work distribution

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

In the customer service center, your agents have different skills sets and abilities. The customers who reaches out to the contact center might have different needs. Skills-based work distribution lets your customer service center distribute the work item (conversation) to the best-qualified agent who is best able to solve the issue. Skills-based work distribution improves the quality of customer service by automatically distributing the work items to the agent who has the skills necessary to do the work.

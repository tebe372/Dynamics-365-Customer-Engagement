# Overview of skill based routing

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

In the customer service center, your agents have different skill sets and abilities. The customers who reaches out to the contact center might have different needs. Skills based routing lets your customer service center distribute the work item (conversation) to the best-qualified agent who is best able to solve the issue. Skills-based routing improves the quality of customer service by automatically distributing the work items to the agent who has the skills necessary to do the work.

For example, for an incoming conversation related to **Xbox** and **Surface** hardware, the skill required is knowledge of **Xbox** and **Surface** products. Now, with skill based routing, the system identifies the agents with specific skill and the distributes the conversation solve it.

Skill based routing allows you to easily match conversation to the agent most proficient in dealing with them in your group, while simultaneously maintaining the load that the agent has to work with. You can associate distinct skills to each agent on your team and create rules to make sure that conversations matching those skills are always assigned to them.

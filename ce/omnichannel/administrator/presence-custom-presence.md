# Configure and manage custom presence

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Presence status indicates an agent's availability or status. Presence status stores, updates, and maintains the real-time status of all agents, with respect to their availability and capacity utilization. When presence status is effectively configured, you can connect customers with agents in real time, for all synchronous conversations (such as live chats) and for all asynchronous conversations (such as cases and leads).

A presence status consists of two elements:

- **Base status**: The base presence status which indicates an agent's availability and status. Work distribution system distributes work items to agents according to these presence statuses. There are five base presence statuses – **Available**, **Busy**, **BusyDND**, **Away**, and **Offline**.
- **Presence text**: The text that is associated with a specific base status. This is the text that is visible to agents and other users during run time. 

## Out of the box presence statuses
Out of the box, Omnichannel provides the following presence statuses:

- Available
- Away
- Busy
- Busy DND
- Offline

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot edit or delete these out of the box presence statuses.

## Create custom presence status 

In addition to the out-of-box presence statuses, admins can configure custom presence statuses for agents. For example, if the agents on your team want to attend a training, you can create a custom **Away – In Training** presence status. 

Follow these steps to create a new presence record.

1. In the Omnichannel site map, go to **Agent Experience \> Custom Presence**.

    The **Active Presences** view is shown.

2. On the command bar, select **New** to create a presence record.
3. On the **Summary** tab, provide the following information:

    1. **Name**: Enter a name for the custom presence status.
    2. **Presence Text**: Enter presence text that should be associated with the new custom entity.
    3. **Base Status**: Select the most applicable base status in the list.
    4. **Description**: Enter a brief description of the custom presence record.

4. Select **Save** to save the new presence record.

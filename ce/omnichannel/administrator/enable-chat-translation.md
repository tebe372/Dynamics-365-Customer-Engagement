# Enable language translation for conversations

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Overview

The real-time message translation feature enables agents to support customers in a language they elect to be serviced in. When you  enable language translation in the Omnichannel Administration app, messages between the customer and support agent and messages among the support agents, such as supervisors or SMEs, who consult and collaborate internally, are translated. The real-time translation feature is enabled as a plug-in that exposes APIs to bring in third-party translation services and also provides a native implementation.

All the languages that are supported in Omnichannel for Customer Service are supported in the conversations. For the list of supported languages, see [Language availability](../international-availability.md).

## Prerequisites

You must configure a web resource and make sure that the required language translation services are configured. More information: [Configure web resource](webresource.md)

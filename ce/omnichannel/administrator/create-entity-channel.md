# Configure an entity channel

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Use entity channel to route entities from Common Data Service to the Omnichannel for Customer Service so that they can be automatically distributed and assigned to agents.

Follow these steps to configure an entity channel.

1. In the Omnichannel site map, go to **Channels \> Entity**.

2. On the command bar, select **New** to create a new entity channel.
3. In the **General** tab:
 
    - Select the entity to be routed in the **Entity** drop-down list.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You can route any activity enabled entity.

    - A default work stream is associated in the **Work stream** field. Select the search icon to associate another entity work stream. Select **New** to create a new entity work stream. For more information, see [Set up an entity work stream](work-streams-introduction.md#set-up-an-entity-work-stream).

4. Select **Save** to save the channel.

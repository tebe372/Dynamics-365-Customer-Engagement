# Assign roles and enable users for Omnichannel for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

All users who are assigned the **Omnichannel administrator**, **Omnichannel supervisor**, or **Omnichannel agent** role are enabled for Omnichannel and become Omnichannel users. Additionally, agents and supervisors must be assigned the **Customer service app access** role along with the **Omnichannel agent** and **Omnichannel supervisor** role.

> [!NOTE]
> To configure Omnichannel, you must assign the **Omnichannel administrator** role mandatorily along with system administrator role.

Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to create user accounts for every user who needs access to Omnichannel for Customer Service. For more information, see  [Create users in the Common Data Service platform and assign security roles](../../admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles.md).

Follow these steps to assign roles to users in the **Advanced Settings**:

1. Select **Settings** > **Advanced Settings** on the command bar. The **Settings** page is displayed in a new browser tab.

2. Select **Settings** > **Security** > **Users**.

3. Select the user or users from the list for whom you want to assign a security role.

4. Select **Manage Roles** in the menu.

   Only the security roles available for that user's business unit are displayed.

5. In the **Manage User Roles** dialog box, select a security role or roles that you want to provide to the user, and then select **OK**.

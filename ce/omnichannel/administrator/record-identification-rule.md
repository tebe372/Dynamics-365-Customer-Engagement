# Automatically identify customers

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Identify and assist customers better by showing their details on the **Customer summary** page. To automatically identify and load customer and case details for an incoming conversation, you need to set up pre-chat questions in the relevant chat widgets. Customer responses are used to search for details in the records and display the results. For an Account or Contact, the search is performed on the **Name**, **Email**, or **Phone Number** field. For Cases, the search is performed on the **Case Number** field.

For every incoming conversation request agent receives a notification appears that includes contextual information for the request, including customer details if available. After the agent accepts the incoming notification, the **Customer summary** page opens, and shows the details of the identified customer and case. 

For more information, see [View Customer summary for an incoming engagement request](../agent/agent-oc/oc-view-customer-summary-incoming-conversation-request.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To know how to create pre-chat questions and use them in a pre-chat survey, see [Configure a pre-chat survey](configure-pre-chat-survey.md). 

Use the below question names to create pre-chat questions for an **Unauthenticated chat**.

|Entity   |     Mapping    | Answer type |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Account |	Question context key: **Name** <br> Attribute Logical Name: **name** <br><br> Question context key: **Email** <br> Attribute logical name: **emailaddress1** <br><br> Question context key: Phone <br> Attribute logical name: **telephone1** | Single line | 
| Contact | Question context key: **Name** <br> Attribute logical name: **fullname** <br><br> Question context key: Email <br> Attribute logical name: **emailaddress1** <br><br> Question context key: Phone <br> Attribute logical name: **telephone1** |Single line | 
| Incident | 	Question context key: **CaseNumber** <br> Attribute logical name: **ticketnumber** |Single line | 

For **Authenticated chat**, the logged in user details will be used to search and load contact information in the **Customer summary** page. You can add pre-chat question for **Case Number** to allow identification of the relevant case for the current conversation.

|Entity   |     Mapping    | Answer type |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Incident | 	Question context key: **CaseNumber** <br> Attribute logical name: **ticketnumber** |Single line | 

## Use the setContextProvider API method

You can automatically identify records using custom context set using setContext API apart from pre-chat answers. To programmatically set these values, see [setContextProvider](../developer/reference/methods/setcontextprovider.md).

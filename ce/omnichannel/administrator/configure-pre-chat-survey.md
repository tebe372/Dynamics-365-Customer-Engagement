# Configure a pre-chat survey

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

You can configure your chat widget to show users a survey that they must respond to before they start the conversation.

1. Sign in to Omnichannel Administration.
2. Go to **Channels** &gt; **Chat**.
3. Open the chat widget in which you want to configure a pre-chat survey, and select **Pre-chat survey**.
4. In the **Pre-chat survey** box, select **Yes**. The options to add questions and refresh the page are displayed.
5. Select **Add question**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can add only five questions to a pre-chat survey. Each question length can be less than or equal to 512 characters.

6. In the **New Question** pane, provide the following information:

    - **Question name**: Enter a name for the question.
    - **Question text**: Enter the text of the question.
    - **Question type**: Select the type of answer that is required from users:

        - **Single line**: The user can enter a single line of text.
        - **Multiple lines**: The user can enter multiple lines of text.
        - **Option set**: The user can select an option in a drop-down list. You must enter options separated by a semi-colon.
        - **User Consent**: Use this option to request user consent for the pre-chat survey. You can provide a link to a webpage, such as the privacy policy page. Links must be in the following format: [link text](link to the webpage). A check box will appear beside the question text in the pre-chat survey.

    - **Mandatory**: Select **Yes** or **No** to indicate whether the question is mandatory. If question type is **User Consent**, make sure you specify **Yes**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Validations in pre-chat surveys are supported only for mandatory fields.

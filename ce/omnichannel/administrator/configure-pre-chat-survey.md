# Configure a pre-chat survey

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0

You can configure your chat widget to show users a survey that they should respond to before they start the conversation.

1. Sign in to Omnichannel for Customer Service.
2. Go to **Administration** &gt; **Chat**.
3. Open the chat widget in which you need to configure pre-chat survey.
4. On the **Survey** tab, in the **Pre-chat survey** field, select **Yes**.
5. Select **Add question**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can add only five questions to a pre-chat survey.

6. In the **Quick Create: Survey Question Sequence** pane, browse and select a question that is already created, and specify whether it's required or optional. To create a new question, see [Create a survey question](create-question-library.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Validations in pre-chat survey are supported only for mandatory fields.

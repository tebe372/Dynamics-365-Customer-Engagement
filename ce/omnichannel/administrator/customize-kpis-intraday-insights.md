# Customize KPIs for Intraday insights

To cater to your organizational needs, the Intraday insights allows you to customize KPIs. This allows supervisors to adapt to your organizational parameters that are specifically designed for your organization. Through the Power BI desktop application, you can customize theses KPIs. The customization of KPIs includes:

- [Add custom KPIs](#add-custom-kpis)

- [Edit measures of existing KPIs](#edit-measures-of-existing-kpis)

- [Edit visuals of existing KPIs](#edit-visuals-of-existing-kpis)

## Review prerequisites

Verify the following prerequisites before you add the custom KPIs:

1. Power BI desktop app is installed on your computer.

2. Administrator or equivalent role is assigned to you. 

3. Intraday insights dashboard is configured for your organization. To Learn more, see [Configure to view intraday insights dashboard](configure-intraday-dashboard-supervisor.md)


## Add custom KPIs

You can add the custom KPIs that are specific to your organization to Intraday insights. This allows Intraday insights to be more specific and help supervisors to adhere your organizational requirements. To add custom KPIs, follow these steps:

1. Open the Power BI desktop application and sign in with your administrator credentials.

2. From the **Home** menu, select **Get Data** > **Power BI datasets**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select Power BI datasets](../media/supervisor-admin-custom-kpis-select-pbidatasets.png "Select Power BI datasets")

    The dataset selection dialog box opens.

3. Select **Intraday insights** and the fields related to Intraday insights dashboards are loaded.

4. Select a field and create a measure for the field. To learn more about creating you own measure, see [Create a measures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-tutorial-create-measures#create-a-measure).

5. Save and publish the measure.
 
6. Add the measure to your report. To learn more, see [Use your measure in the report](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-tutorial-create-measures#use-your-measure-in-the-report)

    The custom KPI measure is added to Intraday insights dashboard.

1. Open the Power BI desktop application and sign in with your administrator credentials.

1. Open the Power BI desktop application and sign in with your administrator credentials.

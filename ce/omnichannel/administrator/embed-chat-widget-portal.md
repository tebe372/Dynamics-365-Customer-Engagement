## Customer experience of chat widget

After the chat widget is configured, it has the following capabilities:

- **Minimized mode**: By default, the chat widget is shown in minimized mode. If any messages are received while the widget is in this mode, a count of the messages is shown.

- **Maximized mode**: A user can maximize the chat widget to start a conversation with an agent.

- **System events**: System-generated messages are shown for events, such as when an agent joins a chat, or a chat is transferred to another agent.

- **Pre-chat survey**: If a survey has been configured by an admin, it's shown to the user before the conversation is started. This survey also helps the user connect to an appropriate agent.

As an administrator, you must enable the settings for supervisors to monitor conversations or assign them to a queue or an agent. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the **Omnichannel Administration** app.

2. Go to **Supervisor Experience** > **Ongoing Conversation Dashboards**.
 
3. Select the **Supervisor Settings** tab and perform the following:

    1. **Supervisor Monitor**: Enable this option for supervisors to monitor conversations that are handled by agents. By default, the monitor option is enabled. 

    2. **Supervisor Assign**: Enable this option for supervisors to assign incoming conversations to queues or agents.

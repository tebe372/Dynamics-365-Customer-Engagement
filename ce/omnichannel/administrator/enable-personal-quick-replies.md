# Enable personal quick replies for agents

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

You can allow agents to create their own personal quick replies that are stored in the agent's context and the agent can invoke them by using the associated tags during a session with a customer. Agents can use personal quick replies to respond to customer queries efficiently with minimal turnaround time.

As an administrator, you can use a Power Automate utility to delete unused tags.

## Enable personal quick replies

1. In the Omnichannel Administration app, go to **Agent Experience**, and select **Personal quick replies**.
2. On the **Personal quick replies** tab, set the **Allow agents to create personal quick replies** toggle to **Yes**.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 15 minutes for the setting to take effect.

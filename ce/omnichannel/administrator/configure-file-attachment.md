# Configure file attachment capability 

As an administrator, you can enable or disable the capability for your agents and customers to attach files during a conversation. When enabled, your customers and agents can send files and share more information about their issues. For example, if a customer receives an error while trying to complete a process, they can send the screenshots of the steps and error message to the agent. 

If an agent transfers the chat to another agent, the agent who receives the chat can also access the files attached in the conversation.

> [!NOTE]
> In Unified Service Desk, if you sign in as an agent and want to attach a file while conversing with a customer, ensure that you select the required file type first and then attach the required file.

1.	Sign in to Omnichannel Administration.

2.	Go to **Channels** > **Chat**.

3.	Open the chat widget in which you need to configure the file attachment capability.

4.	Go to the **Basic details** tab.

5.	Under **File attachments**, select **Yes** or **No** for the following:

    - **Enable file attachments for customers**: Allows your customers to send a file to the customer service agent during a conversation. By default, it is set to No.
    - **Enable file attachments for agents**: Allows your customer service agents to send a file to a customer during a conversation. By default, it is set to Yes.

## Customer experience of attaching a file

When the file attachment capability is enabled for customers, the attachment icon is displayed in the chat widget. A customer can then use the **Attach** icon to send files.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![File attachment icon](../media/file-attach-icon.png "File attachment icon")

If a customer tries to attach an unsupported file type, a file larger than the allowed size limit, or a file with malicious content, the file is not uploaded and a corresponding error message is displayed. 

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![File attachment error](../media/file-attach-error.png "File attachment error")

The file size limit for attachments and unsupported file types are defined in the web client. To configure the file size limit and unsupported file types:

1. Open the web client and go to **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings**.

2. In the **System Settings** window, go to the **Email** tab.

3. In the **Maximum file size (in kilobytes)** field, enter the value in kilobytes.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Set file size limit for attachment](../media/file-size-limit.png "Set file size limit for attachment")

4. To specify unsupported file types, go to the **General** tab.

5. In the **Set blocked file extensions for attachments** field, add or edit the file types.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Specify unsupported file types](../media/unsupported-file-types.png "Specify unsupported file types")

6. Select **OK**.

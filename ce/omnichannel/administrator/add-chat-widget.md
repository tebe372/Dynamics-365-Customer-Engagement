    - **Basic details**:

        1. In the **General information** section, enter a name for the chat widget and select the agent name to be displayed. More information: [Configure agent display name](agent-display-name.md).
        
            You can optionally specify authentication settings. For more information about how to specify authentication settings, see [Create chat authentication settings](create-chat-auth-settings.md). You must save the record to enter more details.

        2. In the **Work distribution** section, browse and select the work stream you created for the chat widget. By default, **Live chat workstream** is selected. More information: [Understand and create work streams](work-streams-introduction.md).
        
        > [!NOTE]
        > If you save the chat widget, you can't edit the **Work stream** field. If you want to edit the field, you must delete the chat widget and create a new one.

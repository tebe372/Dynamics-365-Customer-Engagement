# Manage session templates

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Session templates in Omnichannel are a combination of attributes and application tab information that are reusable. 

When a you accept a chat or SMS incoming conversation request, a session is started. The **Customer Summary** application which is defined as **Anchor Tab** is opened in the application tab panel and it is not closable. Simultaneously, the communication panel is expanded for you to exchange messages with the customer. 

Session templates are used to define the aforementioned session experience such as, 

- which application must be opened as an anchor tab in the application tab panel;
- what are the additional application tabs that must be opened when a session is started;
- what must be default mode of the communication panel when a session is started.

Omnichannel provides out-of-the-box session templates that you can use or create new session templates.

- **Chat for Dynamics 365:** This session template is used for any incoming conversation from the Chat channel.
- **SMS for Dynamics 365:** This session template is used for any incoming conversation from the SMS channel.
- **Case:** This session template is used for a case request.

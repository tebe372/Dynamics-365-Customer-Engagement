## Overview of smart assist

The new-age customer service industry is moving towards the vision of being an intelligent versus process-driven while interacting with customers. Pivoting on intelligence capabilities, helps unleash the productivity of agents to perform better on Key Performance Indicators and at the same time, deliver better customer experience.

As the agents are more efficient and productive, there is a reduction in the cost of operation of the call center. Now, the smart assist feature helps organizations realize the vision of being more intelligent.

Smart assist is an intelligent assistant that provides real-time recommendations to the agents, helping them to take actions while interacting with the customers. It allows organizations to build a custom bot and plug-in to their environment. These custom bot interprets the conversations in real-time and provides relevant recommendations such as knowledge articles, similar cases, and next-best steps to the agent's user interface. The recommendations are shown to the agents using Microsoft Adaptive cards.

The smart assist feature can be enabled across all channels like Chat for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, SMS, and Facebook except entity records making it a consistent experience for agents.

- Intelligence powered using Microsoft Azure or third-party capabilities.

- Improved Average Handling Time (AHT) and First Call Resolution (FCR).

## Pre-requisites

## Walkthrough to enable smart assist

[Step 1: Develop a smart assist bot](#step-1-develop-a-custom-smart-assist-bot)

[Step 2: Create a bot user](#step-2-create-a-bot-user)

[Step 3: Add smart assist bot to workstream](#step-3-add-smart-assist-bot-to-a-workstream)

[Step 4: Add smart assist control to form](#step-4-add-smart-assist-control-to-a-form)

## Step 1: Develop a custom smart assist bot

Develop a custom bot and integrate with Omnichannel for Customer Service app to use the Smart Assist feature. 

### Purpose of smart assist bot

The smart assist bot interprets the conversation context in real-time and provides suggestions to the agents. The smart assist bot sends the suggestions using the [Microsoft Adaptive cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/adaptive-cards/). 

You can embed macros and custom actions within a suggestion with the of use web resources.

For example:

**Custom action:** An agent is displayed with a Knowledge article card with a **Send Link** button. You can implement a custom action to copy and paste the link in the communication panel when agent selects the **Send Link** button.

**Macro:**: An agent is displayed with a Create Case card. You can implement a macro with the card to open a new form to create a case when an agent selects the **Create case** button on the card. While developing the Adaptive cards, you need to specify the name of the macro.

To learn more, see [Smart assist bot](../developer/how-to/smart-assist-bot.md).

## Step 2: Create a bot user

After you create a bot, you must create a bot user to work as a smart assistant to the agent. A bot user is created as an application user and assigned with the **Omnichannel agent** role.

5.  Select **Configure**. The workspace creation takes a few seconds and a confirmation message is displayed with the generated workspace ID.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Power BI workspace ID](../media/supervisor-admin-power-bi-workspace-id.png "Power BI workspace ID")  

    In Power BI, a workspace is created.

6.  Save and close the configuration. 

    After you save the configuration, it may take up to 15 minutes for the datasets, dashboard, and reports to appear in your created workspace.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also see the status of different configuration stages such as workspace, dashboard, and datasets. When a workspace is created successfully, all the statuses will be in Green check. If failed, the respective configuration stage check will be in Red, and an error message is displayed. Resolve the error and create the workspace again.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > - You can configure only one record in **Omnichannel Administration** app. 
   > - If you want to create a new configuration, deactivate and delete the existing configuration.
   > - You can edit an existing configuration to update the Power BI workspace details.

### Verify workspace creation in Power BI

To verify the creation of workspace in Power BI, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to **Power BI** service.

2.  Go to **Workspaces** and verify that a workspace with the name that you have entered is created.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select workspace](../media/supervisor-admin-power-bi-app-select-workspace.png "Select workspace")  

3.  Open the workspace that you have created and verify that the following are available:

    -   An empty dashboard with the name of the workspace.

    -   The report and datasets **IntradayMonitoring**.

### Configure dashboards in Power BI

Configuring the Power BI workspace provides you only the **IntradayMonitoring** report. Create the dashboard out of **IntradayMonitoring** Power BI report after it is available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Power BI settings for **IntradayMonitoring**, DO NOT select the option **Take over**. If you select this option, the dataset will not connect to the datasource and you have to reconfigure intraday insights dashboards. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you want the dashboards with faster refresh rate, import the **LiveMonitoring** Power BI report. Pin tiles to the dashboard from this report for the metrics you want to view with faster refresh. This dashboard consists of Active and open conversations, Conversations exceeding 5 min wait time, Conversations exceeding 5 min handle time, Total conversations transferred, and Open conversations.


Follow these steps to configure Power BI dashboards.

1.  In [Power BI Service](https://app.powerbi.com), open the reports that are available in the workspace. To learn more, see [Open a report in Power BI service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/consumer/end-user-report-open).

2.  Pin the required tiles to dashboards. To learn more, see [Pin a tile to a Power BI dashboard from a report](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-dashboard-pin-tile-from-report).

    The following screen shows how to pin a visual to the dashboard.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Pin a report on dashboard](../media/supervisor-admin-pin-report-to-dashboard.png "Pin a report on dashboard")  

3.  Select **Set as featured** for the created dashboard.

4.  Share the dashboard with supervisor users. This allows supervisors to access the dashboards. To learn more, see [Share your Power BI dashboards and reports with coworkers and others](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-share-dashboards).  

5.  For Unified Service Desk configuration, copy the URL of the dashboard.  

   The dashboard is ready, and you can configure the **Unified Service Desk** or **Omnichannel for Customer Service** on web to make the dashboard available for supervisors.

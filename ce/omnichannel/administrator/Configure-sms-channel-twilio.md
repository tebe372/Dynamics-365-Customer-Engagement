[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Overview

The SMS channel through Twilio in Omnichannel for Customer Service allows your organization to connect to customers by using text messages. Your customers can send text messages through Twilio and connect with an appropriate customer service agent. Agents can view the incoming SMS requests on their dashboard and respond accordingly.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

- SMS for Twilio is provisioned in Omnichannel for Customer Service. More information: [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](omnichannel-provision-license.md)
    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > To enable the SMS channel for Twilio in an existing Omnichannel for Customer Service environment, you must upgrade to the latest version of Omnichannel for Customer Service. More information: [Upgrade Omnichannel for Customer Service](upgrade-omnichannel.md)

- A Twilio account with a phone number and subscription is available.

### Get Twilio account details

An SMS channel is enabled within Omnichannel for Customer Service by integrating with Twilio. This integration uses public APIs of Twilio for sending and receiving text messages.

1. In your Twilio account, note the ACCOUNT SID and AUTH TOKEN values. These values are required to create the SMS configuration in the Omnichannel Administration app.

2. Purchase support phone numbers through your Twilio account.

> [!NOTE]
> In this release, only long-code&ndash;type US phone numbers are supported.

### Create a work stream

Perform the following steps to create a work stream for the SMS channel for Twilio:

1. Sign in to Omnichannel Administration.

2. Under **Work Distribution Management**, select **Work Streams**.

3. Select **New**. The **New Work Stream** page appears.

9. Select **Save**.

10. On the command bar, select **Validate API Key**. The Twilio account and phone number are validated.

### Establish a connection between Omnichannel for Customer Service and the Twilio account

Perform the following steps to configure the URL in Twilio for the SMS messages from Omnichannel for Customer Service to be processed in Twilio:

1. Copy the value in **Twilio inbound URL** of the work stream for Twilio.

2. Go to your Twilio account > **Phone Numbers** > **Active Numbers**, and then select the SMS phone number.

3. In the **Messaging** section, paste the Twilio inbound URL.

## Flow of data between Omnichannel for Customer Service - SMS channel and Twilio

### Incoming text messages

For an incoming text message sent by a customer to the support phone number, the message is first sent to the Twilio messaging service and then pushed by Twilio to Omnichannel for Customer Service by using the callback URL. After this, the message gets routed and associated to either a new or an existing conversation by Omnichannel for Customer Service.

### Outgoing text messages

For an outgoing message sent by an agent from within Dynamics 365, the message is first sent to the Twilio service and then Twilio sends it to the customer. In addition to the text message, Omnichannel for Customer Service uses the APIs provided by Twilio to send the customer's phone number, support phone number, and the Twilio account information (Account SID and the Auth Token) to the Twilio service.

### Twilio account and phone number validation

When you validate the SMS settings while setting up the SMS channel, a call is made to Twilio to validate the Account SID and Auth Token.

# Configure reconnection to a chat session

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Overview

Administrators can provide agents with the ability to reconnect with their customers on loss of connectivity for any reason, such as network failure or customers restarting their browser.

## Enable reconnection for a chat session

You can enable the reconnection options in the chat widget either when setting up the chat widget for the first time or later based on your needs.

# Automate tasks with macros 

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Overview of macros

In the customer service industry, agents have to click too often to do simple tasks (open a form, fill out the form, save the form, and so on) and perform a lot of repetitive and monotonous actions (greet a customer, verify a customer, send acknowledgment mail, take notes, and so on). These clicks and repetitive tasks can lead to human errors while agents copy and paste the data across different operations.

Macros helps address these challenges by helping users perform day-to-day operations in a faster, more efficient, and process-compliant manner. Macros are a set of sequential actions that are executed by a user. You can use macros to automate repetitive and monotonous actions, which in turn reduces human errors (copying and pasting data) and improves agent productivity. Ultimately, improved agent productivity leads to lower average handling time and, hence, improved customer satisfaction.

Macros are like reusable components where you can use the same macro with different sessions based on your organizational requirements. These session are executed based on the context parameters that are specific to a session.

## Value propositions

- Automate repetitive and monotonous tasks with a single click.

- Minimize human errors.

- Adhere to business processes.

- Lower average handling time.

- Improve customer satisfaction.

- Create contextual and reusable macros.

## Prerequisites

- Install Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools solution.

- Ensure that you have the **Productivity tools administrator** security role. To learn more, see [Assign roles and enable users](add-users-assign-roles.md).

- Ensure that agents and supervisors are assigned the **Productivity tools user** security role. To learn more, see [Assign roles and enable users](add-users-assign-roles.md).

## Built-in actions

In Omnichannel for Customer Service, macros provide three connectors:

- [Productivity automation](#productivity-automation): Provides actions to perform model-driven app operations.

- [Session connector](#session-connector): Provides actions to perform session-related operations.

- [Omnichannel connector](#omnichannel-connector): Provides actions to perform Omnichannel for Customer Service&ndash;related operations.

### Productivity automation

As an administrator, you can use the built-in actions any number of times across different macros to automate and perform model-driven app operations.

The following illustration shows the built-in actions.

## Use the automation dictionary to pass macro context data parameters

Macros are a set of configured actions that are executed on demand by users. As an administrator, you need to configure the actions that a macro must perform. To configure the actions, you need to provide certain data parameters keys. When an agent runs the macro, these data parameters keys are replaced by contextual values.

To learn about the slugs for productivity tools, see [Slugs](automation-dictionary-keys.md#slugs-for-productivity-tools-macros-and-agent-scripts).

To learn more, see [Use automation dictionary to pass data parameter keys](automation-dictionary-keys.md#pass-data-parameter-in-macros-and-agent-scripts).

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Create macro](../media/create-macro1.png "Create a macro")

6. Select a connector from the list. The following connectors are available:

   - [Productivity Automation](#productivity-automation)
   - [Session Connector](#session-connector)
   - [Omnichannel Connector](#omnichannel-connector)

7. Select an action from the list of built-in actions. You can add as many actions as you need, based on your business requirements.

   If you select **Productivity Automation**, you'll see the following actions.

    | Purpose | Action name |
    |-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
    | Open a new form to create a record | Create new |
    | Open an existing form | Open form |

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Macro actions](../media/macro-actions.png "Macro actions")    

   For example, select **Open a new form to create a record**, and the step appears. To learn more, see [Productivity automation](#productivity-automation).

   If you select **Session connector**, you'll see the following actions.

    | Purpose | Action name |
    |-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
    | Refresh the application tab | Refresh tab |
    | Focus on a particular application tab from another application tab| Focus tab |
    | Get the details of the current application tab | Get current tab |

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Macro actions](../media/macro-session-connector.png "Macro actions")    

   To learn more, see [Session connector](#session-connector).

   If you select **Omnichannel connector**, you'll see the following actions.

    | Purpose | Action name |
    |-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
    | Link a record to the conversation while interacting with the customer | Link record to the conversation |
    | Unlink a record from the conversation while interacting with the customer | Unlink record from the conversation |

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Macro actions](../media/macro-omnichannel-connector.png "Macro actions") 

   To learn more, see [Omnichannel connector](#omnichannel-connector).

8. Specify the values in the fields. To learn how to specify the values, see [Use automation dictionary to pass data parameters keys](automation-dictionary-keys.md).

   If you selected **Open a new form to create a record**, you can select **Show advanced options** to add the attributes and values you want. If required, you can select **+ Add new item** to add more attributes.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Attributes for Open a new form to create a record](../media/macro-fields.png "Attributes for Open a new form to create a record") 

9. Select **Save and close**.

Now, when the agent executes the macro, the actions will be executed by fetching the data parameter keys according to the context available from the sources. To learn more, see [Use automation dictionary to pass data parameters keys](automation-dictionary-keys.md).

## View macro run history

As an administrator, you can view the macro run history, which shows how many times a macro has been run, along with the success or fail status. When you select a macro that failed, you can view the exact action step at which the failure occurred.

1. Sign in to Omnichannel Administration.

2. Under **Agent Experience**, select **Macros**.

3. Select the macro for which you want to view the history.

4. Select **View run history**.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![View the run history for a macro](../media/macro-run-history.png "View the run history for a macro")

5. Select the macro that failed from the list.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Select the macro that failed](../media/macro-run-history-list.png "Select the macro that failed")

6. See the macro action step that caused the failure. Review the previous step for any issue in the slug data parameters that might have been passed incorrectly or slug data parameters that were updated incorrectly.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Review the macro action steps](../media/macro-run-history-fail.png "Review the macro action steps")

   For example, when you select on the **Open a new form to create a record** step, select **Show more**, and you can view that the mandatory fields doesn't have values, which is mandatory to save the record. Due to this reason, the macro execution failed at the **Save the record** step.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Review the macro action steps](../media/macro-run-history-fail-reason.png "Review the macro action steps")

7. Fix the macro step action that you think might have caused the failure, and then try running it again. For example, since the values are not resolved, go to the macro designer and then check on the slugs, and then try running the macro again.

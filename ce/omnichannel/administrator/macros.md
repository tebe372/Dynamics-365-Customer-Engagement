## Overview of macros

In the customer service industry, agents do too many clicks to perform actions (open a form, fill the form, save the form, and so on), lot of repetitive and monotonous actions (Greet a customer, Verify a customer, Send acknowledgment mail, Take notes, and so on). These clicks and repetitive tasks could lead to human errors while agents copy and paste the data across different operations.

Macros helps address these challenges aiding users to perform day-to-day operations in a faster, efficient, and process compliant manner.

Macros are a set of sequential actions that are executed by a user. You can use the macros to automate repetitive and monotonous actions that in turn reduces the human errors (copy and paste of data) and improve the agent productivity. Ultimately, an improved agent productivity leads to lower average handling time and hence improved customer satisfaction.

The macros are like reusable component where you can use the same macro with different sessions based on your organizational requirements. These session are executed based on the context parameters that are specific to a session.



## Value propositions

- Automate repetitive and monotonous tasks with a single click

- Minimization of human errors

- Adherence to business processes

- Lower Average Handling Time

- Improved customer satisfaction

- Contextual and reusable macro

## Prerequisites

- Install Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools solution.

- Ensure you have the **Productivity tools administrator** security role. To learn more, see [Assign roles and enable users](add-users-assign-roles.md).

- Ensure agents and supervisors are assigned **Productivity tools user** security role. To learn more, see [Assign roles and enable users](add-users-assign-roles.md).

## Built-in actions

As an administrator, you can use the built-in actions any number of times across differnt macros to automate and perform operations.

The following are the built-in actions.

## Use automation dictionary to pass macro context data parameters

Macros are a set of configured actions that are executed on-demand by users. As an administrator, you need to configure the actions that a macro must perform. To configure the actions, you need to provide certain data parameters keys. When the agent runs the macro, these data parameters keys are replaced by the contextual values.

To learn more, see [Use automation dictionary to pass data parameter keys](automation-dictionary-keys.md#pass-data-parameter-in-macros).

## Create macro

1. Sign in to the Omnichannel Administration app.

2. Select **Macros** under **Agent Experience**.

3. Select **+ New**.

4. Specify the following in the **Create macros** page.

    | Field | Description | Example value |
    |-------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
    | Name | Provide a name to the macro. The name is displayed to the agent at the run time. | Create case |
    | Description | Describe the purpose of the macro. The description is displayed to the agent at the run time. | This macro action is used to create a case. |

5. Select **Start macro execution**, and then select **+ New step**.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Create macro](../media/create-macro1.png "Create macro")

6. Select an action from a list of built in actions. You can add as many as actions as per your business requirements.

    | Purpose | Action name |
    |-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
    | Open a new form to create a record | Create new |
    | Open an existing form | Open form |
    | Open a record grid | Open grid |
    | Search the knowledge base for the populated phrase | Search knowledge articles |
    | Do a relevance search based on the phrase | Search |
    | Update an existing record | Update record |
    | Open an email form with predefined template | Open email |
    | Resolve a case | Resolve case |

    For example, select **Open a new form to create a record**, and the step appears.

7. Specify the values in the fields.

8. Select **Show advanced options** to add required attributes and values. If required, you can select **+ Add new item** to add more attributes.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Macro actions](../media/macro-fields.png "Macro actions") 

9. Select **Save and close** to save and close the macro changes.

Now, when the agent executes the macro, the actions will be executed by fetching the data parameter keys according the context available from the sources.

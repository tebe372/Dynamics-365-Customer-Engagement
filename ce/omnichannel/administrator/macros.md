## Overview of macros

In the customer service industry, agents do too many clicks to perform actions (Open a form, fill the form, save the form, and so on), lot of repetitive and monotonous tasks (Greet a customer, Verify a customer, Send acknowledgment mail, Take notes, and so on). These clicks and repetitive tasks could lead to human errors while agents copy and paste the data across different operations.

Macros helps address these challenges aiding users to perform day-to-day operations in a faster, efficient, and process compliant manner.

## Value propositions

- Automate repetitive and monotonous tasks with a single click

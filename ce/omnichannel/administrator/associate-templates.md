# Associate templates with workstreams

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

After creating the session, notification, and application tab templates, you must associate these with a workstream so that the notification template is used for an incoming conversation. After the agent accepts the conversation, a session starts for which the session template is used. In the session, certain application tabs are required such as KB search and Case page. These application tabs are configured using the application tab templates and are associated with a session.

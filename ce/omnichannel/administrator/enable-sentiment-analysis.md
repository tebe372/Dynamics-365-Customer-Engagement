# Analyze real-time customer sentiment

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is intended to help customer service managers or supervisors enhance their teamâ€™s performance and improve customer satisfaction. This feature is not intended for use in making, and should not be used to make, decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365 Customer Service, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring, recording, and storing communications with end users. This also includes adequately notifying end users that their communications with agents may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their agents that their communications with end users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.

Sentiment analysis settings in Omnichannel for Customer Service provide agents and supervisors with real-time insight regarding how customers are interacting with agents during chat sessions.

## Sentiment analysis

To let agents and supervisors see the customer's satisfaction levels instantly while communicating with the customer, you need to enable the sentiment analysis.

> [!NOTE]
> Sentiment analysis is enabled by default.

1. Sign in to **Omnichannel Administration**.

2. Under **Settings**, select **Sentiment Analysis**, and then select **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**.

3. In the **Sentiment analysis** section, set the **Monitor real-time customer sentiment** toggle to **Yes**, and then select **Save**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Enable sentiment analysis](../media/monitor-real-time.png "Enable sentiment analysis")

After you enable real-time customer sentiment, you can view scores in the [Omnichannel Insights dashboards](configure-historical-sentiment-dashboard-supervisor.md).

## Agent settings

Agents can view the customer sentiment in the communication panel for a conversation session that is active and in focus. For a session that is not in focus, the alert is shown on the session panel.

You can show alerts to the agents when a customer's sentiment decreases to or below a particular value. You can set the customer's sentiment to any of the following values:

- Don't show alerts
- Slightly negative
- Negative
- Very negative

For example, you set the threshold value as **Slightly negative**. When the customer's sentiment reaches **Slightly negative** or any other sentiment value below this, an alert is displayed to the agent.

1. Sign in to **Omnichannel Administration**.

2. Under **Settings**, select **Sentiment Analysis**, and then select **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**.

3. In the **Agent settings** section, select a value from the **Show alerts when a customer's sentiment decreases to or below** list. The options are:

    - Don't show alerts
    - Slightly negative
    - Negative
    - Very negative

      > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
      > ![Show alerts when a customer's sentiment decreases to or below](../media/monitor-real-time-agent.png "Show alerts when a customer's sentiment decreases to or below")

To turn off agent alerts, select **Don't show alerts**.

## Supervisor settings

Supervisors can use the **Omnichannel Ongoing Conversation** dashboard to view customer sentiment in real time during conversations between customers and agents.

You can show notifications to the supervisors when a customer's sentiment decreases to or below a particular value. You can set the customer's sentiment to any of the following values:

- Don't show notifications
- Slightly negative
- Negative
- Very negative

For example, you set the threshold value as **Slightly negative**. When the customer's sentiment reaches **Slightly negative** or any other sentiment value below this, a notification is displayed to the supervisor.


1. Sign in to **Omnichannel Administration**.

2. Under **Settings**, select **Sentiment Analysis**, and then select **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**.

3. In the **Supervisor settings** section, select a value from the **Send notifications when a customer's sentiment decreases to or below** list. The options are:

    - Don't send notifications
    - Slightly negative
    - Negative
    - Very negative

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Send notifications when a customer's sentiment decreases to or below](../media/monitor-real-time-supervisor.png "Send notifications when a customer's sentiment decreases to or below")

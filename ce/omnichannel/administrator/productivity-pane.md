# Productivity pane overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

The productivity pane in Omnichannel for Customer Service enables you to display agent guidance (knowledge search, agent scripts, and smart-assist cards) in a unified view. First you need to configure knowledge search, agent scripts, and smart-assist cards so these agent guidance tools will display in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

If you have recently updated the Omnichannel Administration app, you will no longer enable or disable the productivity pane in the app. On upgrade, an app profile was created for your environment via Power Apps. The app profile contains your existing settings and the ability to toggle each of the agent guidance components available in the productivity pane: 

- Knowledge search
- [Smart assist](smart-assist.md)
- [Agent scripts](agent-scripts.md)

You can set the productivity pane in collapsed mode or expanded mode, as shown in the following illustrations.

**Collapsed mode**

> [!div class='mx-imgBorder']
> ![Productivity pane](../media/productivity-pane-collapsed.PNG "Productivity pane in collapsed mode")

**Expanded mode**

> [!div class='mx-imgBorder']
> ![Productivity pane](../media/productivity-pane-expanded.PNG "Productivity pane in expanded mode")

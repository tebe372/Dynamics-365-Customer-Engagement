## Introduction

Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools app provides capabilities that help users to perform day-to-day operations in a faster, efficient, and process compliant manner and deliver value to customers. 

### Challenges

In the customer service industry, agents are expected to handle a large volume of customer issues and resolve them at a faster rate with high customer value and satisfaction while adhering to process standards. 

Whilst there are challenges such as:
 
- Too many clicks to perform actions (Open a form, fill the form, save the form, and so on). 
- Repetitive and monotonous tasks (Greet a customer, Verify a customer, Send acknowledgment mail, Take notes, and so on).
- Human errors introduced during copy paste of data across different pages 
- Process adherence and compliance that are specific to the contact center business organizations.
Lack of real-time insights on the customer, knowledge article, and other relevant needs based on the context of the interaction.

Agents need to tackle these challenges to achieve what their business and customers require. 
 
Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools app helps address these challenges aiding users to perform day-to-day operations in a faster, efficient, and process compliant manner.
 
Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools app contains the following tools:

- [Macros](#macros)
- [Agent scripts](#agent-scripts)
- [Smart Assist](#smart-assist)

## Macros

With Macros, agents can perform repetitive, monotonous tasks—Open model-driven app forms, pre-populate fields with the details, send an email to a customer, take notes, and much more—all in a single click.
A macro is a set of instructions that tells the system how to complete a task. When an agent runs a macro, the system performs each instruction and this helps save time and accommodate agents to handle more customer issues. Also, Macros provides preciseness, clarity and consistency to the tasks that agents perform.
 
## Agent scripts 

Agent scripts provide guidance to agents about what they should to doing when they get a customer issue. It ensures that only accurate, company-endorsed information is being shared, while also safeguarding the organization in regard to legal-compliance issues. Agent scripts help your organization to be unified, accurate, and effective while being faster and more-efficient in terms of customer handling.
 
## Smart assist

Smart assist provides suggestions to agents on what is the next-best course of action they need to take based on the real-time context of the customer interaction. The suggestions are intelligent and helps the  agents to be more productive with knowledge articles, similar cases, and much more. The smart assist is available across all the channels supported by Omnichannel making it a consistent and intelligence experience for agents.

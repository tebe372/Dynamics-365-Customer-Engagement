# Overview of productivity tools

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Introduction

The Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools app provides capabilities that help users to perform day-to-day operations in a fast, efficient, and process-compliant manner and deliver value to customers. 

### Challenges

In the customer service industry, agents are expected to handle a large volume of customer issues and resolve them at a faster rate with high customer value and satisfaction while adhering to process standards. 

Whilst there are challenges such as:
 
- Too many clicks to perform actions (open a form, fill out the form, save the form, and so on). 
- Repetitive or monotonous tasks (greet a customer, verify a customer, send acknowledgment mail, take notes, and so on).
- Human errors introduced during copy paste of data across different pages 
- Process adherence and compliance that are specific to the contact center business organizations.
- Lack of real-time insights to the customer, knowledge articles, and other relevant needs based on the context of the interaction.

Agents need to tackle these challenges to achieve what their business and customers require. 
 
Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools app helps address these challenges, aiding users to perform day-to-day operations in a fast, efficient, and process-compliant manner.
 
The Dynamics 365 Productivity Tools app contains the following tools:

- [Macros](#macros)
- [Agent scripts](#agent-scripts)
- [Smart assist](#smart-assist)

### Macros

With macros, agents can perform repetitive, monotonous tasks—Open model-driven app forms, pre-populate fields with the details, send an email to a customer, take notes, and much more—all in a single click.
A macro is a set of sequential actions that tells the system how to complete a task. When an agent executes a macro, the system performs each action and this helps save time and accommodate agents to handle more customer issues. Also, macro provides preciseness, clarity and consistency to the tasks that agents perform.
 
### Agent scripts 

Agent scripts provide guidance to agents about what to do when they get a customer issue. The scripts ensure that only accurate, company-endorsed information is being shared, while also safeguarding the organization in regard to legal-compliance issues. Agent scripts help organizations to be unified, accurate, and effective while also being faster and more efficient in terms of customer handling.
 
### Smart assist

Smart assist is an intelligent assistant that provides real-time recommendations to the agents, helping them to take actions while interacting with customers. It allows organizations to build a custom bot and plug-in real-time to their environment. Also, organizations can develop relevant recommendations such as knowledge articles, similar cases, and next-best steps using Microsoft Adaptive cards. These recommendation cards are surfaced to the agent's user interface based on the context of the current conversation.

The smart assist feature can be enabled across all channels like Chat for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, SMS, and Facebook except entity records making it a consistent experience for agents.

## Agent guidance in productivity pane

The productivity pane, when enabled, displays the agent guidance control that shows the agent scripts and smart-assist cards.

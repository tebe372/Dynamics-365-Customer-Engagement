# Download attachments from your Azure bot

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

This topic mentions the steps that you need to follow to download attachments from your Azure bot.

1. Get the token for your bot. You can do so by providing your botâ€™s Microsoft AppId and Client Secret. More information: [Connector Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-connector-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

2. Fetch the `attachmentId` from the attachment content URL. For example, the `attachmentId` in this URL `https://us-api.asm.skype.com/v1/objects/0-eus-d1-5360689c55c308cb4e3b51722e46b801/` is `0-eus-d1-5360689c55c308cb4e3b51722e46b801`. 

3.	Use the `attachmentId` in the `RequestUri` variable. Then, call the `GET` request using the `HttpRequestMessage` method, as shown in the sample code below.

```csharp
string requestUri = $"https://botapi.skype.com/amer/v3/attachments/{attachmentId}/views/original";
var httpRequest = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, requestUri);
 
var authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("bearer", <add the botToken here>);
var requestHeaders = new Dictionary<string, string>()
  {
     { "Authorization", authorization.ToString() }
  };

foreach (var header in requestHeaders)
  {
      httpRequest.Headers.Add(header.Key, header.Value);
  }

HttpResponseMessage response = await client.SendAsync(httpRequest);
```

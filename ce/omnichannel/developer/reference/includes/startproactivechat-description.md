Proactive chat enables organizations to engage with users by automatically inviting them to a chat conversation based on the configured rules. Organizations can use end-user data, user journey information, time spent on web page, and more to decide when to best engage with them. Organizations can control the proactive chat experience using personalized trigger messages and configurable rules to define the target audience, time frame, and target location.

# Pass customer journey as context

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

In a conversation with a customer, it is important that the agent does not point the customer to a page or link that the customer has already visited. Omnichannel for Customer Service provides you the capability to track a customer's actions across your website and pass that as context in a conversation with that customer.

Use the [setContextProvider](../reference/methods/setContextProvider.md) method to pass customer's portal navigation history as context in the conversation.

## Sample code

```javascript

```

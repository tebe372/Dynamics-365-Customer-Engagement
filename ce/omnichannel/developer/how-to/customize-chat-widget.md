# Customize a chat widget

Chat widgets can be customized by using data tags on the widget script.

|Attribute name|Description|
|----|-----|
|`data-enable-telemetry`| Due to privacy concerns, telemetry is turned off for all widgets by default. Using this attribute, customers can allow telemetry collection from the chat widget. |
|`data-hide-chat-button`| When the HTML snippet is added to a website, a widget shows up on that website by default. In some cases, customers may want to implement the chat widget using their own button so this attribute allows customers to hide the chat button. |

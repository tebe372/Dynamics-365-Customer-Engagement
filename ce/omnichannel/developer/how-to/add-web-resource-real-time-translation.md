# Add a web resource for real time translation

You can use a web resource to implement the logic for enabling real time translation of the conversation messages exchanged between the customer and the agent.

For more information about web resources, see [Web resources in model-driven apps](/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/web-resources).

Once you have created and uploaded your JavaScript file as a web resource, follow the steps given below to copy its URL in the Omnichannel Administration app.

1. Open the Omnichannel Administration app.
2. Select **Real Time Translation** in the sitemap.
3. Copy the web resource URL in the **Web resource URL** field.

4. Select **Save**.

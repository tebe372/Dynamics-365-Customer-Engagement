# Add a web resource for real-time translation

You can use a web resource to implement the logic for enabling real-time translation of the conversation messages exchanged between the customer and the agent.

For more information about web resources, see [Web resources in model-driven apps](/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/web-resources).

Once you have created and uploaded the web resource, copy its URL in the Omnichannel Administration app.

![Add web resource](../../media/real-time-translation-web-resource.png "Add web resource")

Select **Save** after you have copied the web resource URL into the **Web resource URL** field.

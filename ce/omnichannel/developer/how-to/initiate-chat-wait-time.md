# Initiate a chat

Applies to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.1.0.

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

<!--note from editor:  specify what the user is waiting for--customer support, specifically?  -->

Follow these steps to start a chat:

1. Listen to the **lcw:ready** event raised by a live chat to start using the live chat SDK methods. The live chat methods should be invoked only after the widget loads fully and the **lcw:ready** event is fired. You can listen for this event by adding your own event listener on the window object.
2. Once the **lcw:ready** event is raised, call the [startChat](../reference/methods/startChat.md) method to initiate a chat.

## Sample code

```JavaScript
window.addEventListener("lcw:ready", function handleLivechatReadyEvent(){
	// Handle LiveChat SDK ready event
	// SDK methods are ready for use now
	// Initiate a chat using startChat SDK
	Microsoft.Omnichannel.LiveChatWidget.SDK.startChat();
});

window.addEventListener("lcw:error", function handleLivechatErrorEvent(errorEvent){
	// Handle LiveChat error event
	console.log(errorEvent);
});
```
You might want to set up a rule that a chat widget will programmatically open after a user has been waiting on a website for a certain amount of time. Consider a situation in which a user of the website of Contoso Ltd. has been waiting for one minute.

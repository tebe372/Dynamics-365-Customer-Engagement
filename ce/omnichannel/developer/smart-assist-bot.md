# Smart assist for Bots

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

Based on the context passed for an incoming conversation, Omnichannel for Customer Service recommends help resources to assist the agent to successfully resolve customer's queries. The Smart assist card uses [Adaptive cards](https://adaptivecards.io), which is an open source standard that helps apps and services exchange rich snippets of native UI.

## Sample code

You can find the entire code sample here: [Smart Assist for Bots]().

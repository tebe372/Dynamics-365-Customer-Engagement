# Create your own guided help (Learning Path) for your customers

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Learning Path is currently not available on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Germany. However, it will be made available over time. Please check back for the latest information.

Use [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] to give your users a custom, in-app Help experience that is tailored to your environment and the specific usage and workflow of your organization. [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] facilitates learning and adoption of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] and organizational processes, ensures that data is entered and interpreted consistently, and reduces errors and support calls generated by users. [Watch a short video (1:50) about Learning Path](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crmvideos/archive/2016/05/09/introducing-learning-path-for-dynamics-crm).  

<a name="CustomHelp"></a>   
<!-- TODO: Custom help is only supported for on-prem. This topic needs a bunch of stuff commented out. -->

## How is Learning Path different from customizable Help?  
 Customizable Help allows you to override the default [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] Help and point users in your organization to a different URL for Help. Or you can override the Help for a highly-customized entity so that you can better describe your workflow. Customizable Help is available for only for [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_op](../includes/pn-dyn-365-op.md)] on-premises deployments.
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] lets you add customizable Help that users see in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] when they open a page, perform an action, or click the Help button ?. [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] is available only for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  
 <!-- 
 You can use customizable Help or [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)], but not both.  
 --> 
 For more information about customizable Help, see [Customize the Help experience](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn832079.aspx).  
  
<a name="Avail"></a>   
## Prerequisites  
 To create [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content, you must:  
  
-   Be using [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  
  
-   Have [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-online.md)] or later. Note that users can view the [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content created by Microsoft if they have [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_1_0_online_subsequent](../includes/pn-crm-8-1-0-online-subsequent.md)] or later, but you must have the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-online.md)] to author [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content.  
  
-   Have opted in for [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)]. This setting is on by default, but can be turned off.  
  
     To turn Learning Path on: On the nav bar, click the **Options**  icon ![Options button for Dynamics 365](../customize/media/optionsbutton.png "Options button for Dynamics 365") > **Opt in for Learning Path**.  
  
     For more information, see [On-off switch for Learning Path (guided help)](../admin/on-off-switch-for-learning-path-guided-help.md).  
  
-   Have the System Customizer or System Administrator Role, or another role that has the [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] Authoring privilege.  
  
-   Enable [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] authoring. This creates the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] Authors security group.  
  
-   Be a member of the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] Authors security group.  
  
 You can author [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content for web app modules and Unified Interface app modules. This includes [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_short](../includes/pn-moca-short.md)].  
  
<a name="TurnOnLP"></a>   
## Turn on Learning Path for your organization  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] is an optional feature that can be turned on or off for your organization. You can display Learning Path content included with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], create your own [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content for your users, or both.  
  
1.  Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] with an admin account.  
  
2.  Click **Settings**, and then click **Administration** under **System**.  
  
3.  On the **Administration** page, click **System Settings**.  
  
4.  On the **General** tab, under **Set custom Help URL**, select **Yes** for **Enable Learning Path** and **Enable Learning Path Authoring**.  
  
     You can enable [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] or customizable Help, but not both at the same time. Confirm that **Use custom Help for customizable entities** and **Append parameters to URL** are set to **No**.  
  
      ![System Settings dialog showing the options to select to enable Learning Path authoring](../customize/media/lp-system-settings.png "System Settings dialog showing the options to select to enable Learning Path authoring")  
  
5.  Click **OK**.  
  
<a name="ReqsAuth"></a>   
## Add a user to the Office 365 Learning Path Authors security group  
 If you're not a member of the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] Authors security group, you'll see the following error message when you open the [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] Content Library.  
  
 ![Error message indicating that you are not a member of the Learning Path security group](../customize/media/lp-o365-security-group.png "Error message indicating that you are not a member of the Learning Path security group")  
  
#### Add a user  
  
1.  Go to the admin portal for your [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] tenant by clicking  the **Navigate to other applications** button in the top-left corner of the page when you're signed in to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], and then select **Admin**.  
  
     You may be asked to re-enter your password.  
  
2.  In the **Admin center**, click **Groups**.  
  
3.  On the **Groups** page, select the **Learning Path Authors** security group.  
  
4.  Click **Edit** in the **Members** row to add users to the group.  
  
5.  Click **+ Add members**, and then specify or search for the user(s) you want to add to the group.  
  
6.  Click **Save** when you're finished adding users.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Another way to assign the group to a user account is by selecting **Users > Active Users**, selecting the user you want to add, and then clicking **Edit** next to **Group memberships** to select the group(s) to add the user to.  
  
<a name="MultipleOrgs"></a>   
## How does Learning Path work with multiple organizations?  
 When you publish [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content, you can use Publishing Environments to control which organizations associated with the tenant your content is published to. To publish different content to different organizations, create multiple publishing environments and add each organization to one or more of them.  
  
<a name="SecurityRoles"></a>   
## Learning Path and Dynamics 365 security roles  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] uses security roles to determine what [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content is displayed when a user clicks the Help button, navigates to a page, or performs a defined action in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
 The roles used in [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] are the same roles used in your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organization for security and data access, but you can create [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content for any or all of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] security roles.  Typically, you want the security roles in the [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] designer to match your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance. However, you can simplify the user interface in the designer by hiding some [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] security roles from the designer. If you later decide that you want to use a security role that you deleted from [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)], you can synchronize the roles between [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
 If your organization has multiple business units, security roles can have parent/child relationships. Only the security roles in the root business unit are synchronized.  
  
 For more information about security roles, see [Security roles and privileges](../admin/security-roles-privileges.md).  
  
<a name="Precedence"></a>   
### Learning Path role precedence  
 If a user in your organization is assigned more than one security role, precedence is used to determine which assigned security role is used for displaying [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content. If [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content is associated with a security role, any user assigned that role will see the [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content, even if they are assigned a security role with higher precedence that is not associated with the [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content.  
  
 Each role included in [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] has a numeric value. The first role in the list has the highest precedence, and subsequent roles have lower precedence . When a user is assigned a role that triggers the display of [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content, the user will see that content even if that user is assigned a role with lower precedence that is not associated with the content. For example, if a user is assigned a role with precedence 1 and a role with precedence 20, the user will see [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content defined only for the role with precedence 1.  
  
 If you create different content for different roles on the same [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] page or screen, users will see the content associated with the role with higher precedence.  
  
<a name="ManageRoles"></a>   
### Manage security roles and precedence  
 You can control which security roles are available in the [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] designer, and set the order of roles for determining precedence when [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] runs. If a user has two roles, and there is different content published for a given context for each of these roles, the user will see the content for the role that appears higher in the list.  
  
<a name="ConfigureRoles"></a>   
#### Configure security roles  
  
1.  Login to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] with an account that has [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] authoring permissions.  
  
2.  Open the **Content Library**.  
  
3.  Click **Configuration** at the top of the screen.  
  
4.  To synchronize the security roles with your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], click **Sync Roles**.  
  
5.  To set the order of precedence for the roles used with [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)], use the up or down arrows to move a role higher or lower in the list.  
  
     Precedence is determined by the order of the roles listed on this page.  
  
6.  To delete a role from being used with [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)], click the Delete button next to the role.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  This does not delete the role from [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. It deletes the role in the [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] designer to define how content is displayed to users. You can always restore a hidden role by selecting **Sync Roles**.  
  
7.  When you are finished making changes, click **Save**.  
  
8.  Click **Back** to return to the Content Library.  
  
<a name="MobileApp"></a>   
## Create Learning Path controls for [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_tablets](../includes/pn-dyn-365-tablets.md)]  
 You can create [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] controls for [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_tablets](../includes/pn-dyn-365-tablets.md)] the same way you create controls for the web client. To do this you must use the mobile app simulator in a web browser so that you have access to the mobile UI for pinning your Learning Path controls. This simulator is to be used only for this purpose.  
<!--
From AMY: I do not think this is true anymore now that it is all uci. I believe you just have to author for the right app module. This should really be called out as "authoring for tablets just got easier". Check with Ram.
-->
  
### Display the mobile app interface simulator in a web browser  
  
1.  Log in to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].  
  
2.  Copy the server name  for your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organization from the URL displayed in your browser, for example *https://contososales.crm.dynamics.com/*.  
  
     Make sure to include the slash (/) after .com.  
  
3.  Determine the unique name for the org (also called instance) you want to create [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] controls for. To get the unique  name, on the site map click **Settings** > **Customizations**, and then on the **Cusomtization** page click **Developer Resources**. Copy the value for the **Unique Name** field displayed under the **Instance Reference** section.  
  
    ![Dynamics org name displayed in the user info pane](../customize/media/lp-org-name.png "Dynamics org name displayed in the user info pane")  
  
4.  Append the following to the first part of the URL for your org, replacing \<org name> with the unique name for your org determined in the previous step:  
  
     nga/main.htm?org=*\<org name>*  
  
     Your URL should look similar to the following: https://contososales.crm.dynamics.com/nga/main.htm?org=orgb557e46a  
  
5.  Append the following to the URL from the previous step, replacing \<server name> with the server name from the first step in this procedure:  
  
     &server=*\<server name>*  
  
     Your URL should look similar to the following: https://contososales.crm.dynamics.com/nga/main.htm?org=orgb557e46a&server=https://contososales.crm.dynamics.com/.  
  
6.  Open a new tab or browser window and copy the full URL you created, paste it into the new tab or browser window, and then press ENTER.  
  
     The first time you connect to the mobile app interface, a welcome screen is displayed while the system processes metadata and downloads customizations. Once completed, your workspace is displayed.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  When you connect to the mobile app version of the interface, the credentials from your login to the web interface are used to authenticate you. You'll need to leave the web interface open to avoid getting access denied errors when opening the mobile app interface.  
  
7.  Close your workspace to display the Home page for the mobile app interface in your browser. You can then open the Content Library to create or edit Learning Path controls. For more information, see [Content Library](#ContentLibrary).  

<!--
From Amy: There is no longer anything special about ISH. It is just another app module. Commenting this out.

<a name="ISH"></a>   
## Create Learning Path controls for the Interactive Service Hub  
 If your organization uses the Interactive Service Hub, you can also create your own [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] controls for the Interactive Service Hub  interface. To create controls, you can display the Interactive Service Hub interface in your browser, and then access the Content Library to create or edit controls just like you would for  the web interface.  
  
 To access the Interactive Service Hub interface, do one of the following:  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], go to **Settings** > **Interactive Service Hub**.  
  
     This option is available only to users with the Customer Service Manager, System Administrator, or System Customizer role.  
  
-   Directly open it by entering a URL in your browser.  
  
     Type `https://<Dynamics 365 Server>.crm.dynamics.com/nga/engagementhub.aspx`, and press **Enter**.  
  
     Replace \<Dynamics 365 Server> with the name of your server, for example *contososales*.  
  
     Your URL should look similar to the following: https://contososales.crm.dynamics.com/nga/engagementhub.aspx  
  
 For more information about the Interactive Service Hub, see [Interactive service hub – User’s guide](../customer-service/interactive-service-hub-users-guide.md)  
-->
  
<a name="ContentLibrary"></a>   
## Content Library  
 The Content Library displays all of the content created and available to your organization, as well as the commands to create, manage, and interact with controls. To create or edit [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] controls, first connect to the client interface for which you want to create controls, and then open the Content Library.  
  
**To open the Content Library from the default web client interface, do one of the following:**  
  
-   On a sidebar, click the **Content Library** button.  
  
     ![The Content Library icon displayed on a Leaning Path sidebar](../customize/media/lp-sidebar-cl-icon.png "The Content Library icon displayed on a Leaning Path sidebar")  
  
-   Click the **training** tile on the site map, and then click **Content Library**.  
  
     ![Content Library icon on the Dynamics 365 sitemap](../customize/media/lp-sitemap-content-library.png "Content Library icon on the Dynamics 365 sitemap")  
  
**To open the Content Library from the mobile app interface simulator:**  
  
1.  Click the ellipses button inside a circle on the bottom-right corner of the screen.  
  
    ![Ellipses button to display Learning Path icons](../customize/media/lp-cl-ellipses.png "Ellipses button to display Learning Path icons")  
  
2.  Click **Learning Path Content Library**.  
  
    ![Learning Path buttons displayed in the mobile app interface](../customize/media/lp-mobile-lp-button.png "Learning Path buttons displayed in the mobile app interface")  

<!--  
**To open the Content Library from the Interactive Service Hub interface, do one of the following:**  
  
-   If a sidebar is displayed, click the [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] icon on the sidebar.  
  
-   If there is no sidebar displayed, click the **Help** icon in the top-right corner of the page, and then click the [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] icon on the sidebar that is displayed.  
  
-   On the **Main** menu, click **Help Center** and then click **Content Library** under **Learning Path**.  
-->
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you do not see all of these columns in the Content Library, it might be because your browser's View zoom  is set to higher than 100%. To see all of the columns, set the zoom setting to 100% or lower.  
  
 The Content Library includes the columns described in the following table:  
  
|Column|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|**Name**|The name you used when you created the Guided Task or Sidebar. A red lock symbol next to the name indicates that the content is currently checked out. You can hover over the icon to see which user has the content checked out.<br /><br /> ![Red lock icon indicates that the content is checked out.](../customize/media/lp-cl-checked-out.png "Red lock icon indicates that the content is checked out.")<br /><br /> A red asterisk next to the name indicates newly checked-in content.<br /><br /> ![Red asterisk indicating newly checked in content](../customize/media/lp-cl-new-check-in.png "Red asterisk indicating newly checked in content")|  
|**Title**|The title you provided when you added content to the Guided Task or Sidebar. Titles for Sidebars and Guided Tasks are displayed on Sidebars when they are added as links, or when they are returned as search results.|  
|**Type**|A symbol that indicates the type of content: Sidebar or Guided Task|  
|**Form Factor**|Symbols that represent the form factor  selected for this content when it was created, either **Desktop** or **Tablet**.<br /><br /> The **Form Factor** column is not displayed when you are using the Content Library when connected to the mobile app interface simulator or the Interactive Service Hub.|  
|**Tags**|Displays any tags  applied to this content. You can add tags in the **Advanced Options** dialog box. Use tags to  filter content displayed in the library.|  
|**App Version**|The version of the application that the control was created on.|  
|**Author**|The name of the person who created the control.|  
|**Languages**|A numeric value that represents the number of languages to which the control has been localized.<br /><br /> This col|  
|**Status**|Displays **Published** if the content is currently published; otherwise the status is **Draft**.|  
|**Enabled**|Displays whether the content is enabled or disabled.  Only enabled content is displayed to your users.|  
|**Last Published**|The most recent date when the content was published.|  
  
<a name="ContentTypes"></a>   
## Learning Path content types: Guided Tasks and Sidebars  
 You can create two types of content in [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)]: Guided Tasks and Sidebars.  
  
<a name="GT"></a>   
### Guided Tasks  
 A Guided Task is typically a series of steps, although it can also be a single step. A user can launch a Guided Task by clicking a link on a Sidebar, by navigating to a page, or by clicking a link on a page for which you have created content. In each step, the user clicks the **Next** button or completes a defined action to proceed to the next step, or to complete the Guided Task.  
  
 Guided Tasks are useful for guiding your users through common or new tasks. They can also be used to ensure that tasks are performed consistently in your organization, or that data is entered a specific way to support your organization's processes or workflow. You can include links, videos, and other information in Guided Tasks to help your users become familiar with and learn more about the part of the user interface that the step references.  
  
<a name="Sidebar"></a>   
### Sidebars  
 A Sidebar is displayed when a user clicks the Help button, navigates to a page, or clicks a link or button on a page for which you have created content. You can also create Home Sidebars that are displayed when the user opens the page or screen, or clicks the Home icon  on a Sidebar.  
  
 ![Home icon on a sidebar](../customize/media/sidebar-home.png "Home icon on a sidebar")  
  
 You can also define Error Sidebars that appear when there is a problem displaying the intended sidebar. You can include links, videos, and other information in sidebars to help your users become familiar with and learn more about the page or form displayed, or actions they can take on the page or form.  
  
<a name="CreateGT"></a>   
## Create a Guided Task  
 There are two steps for creating a Guided Task:  
  
1.  Define how the task is triggered, and assign the roles to which the content applies.  
  
2.  Use the Flow Editor to add the steps that users will see as they step through the Guided Task.  
  
### Define the triggers and roles  
  
1.  Go to the page for which you want to create a Guided Task.  
  
2.  Open the Content Library. See    [Content Library](#ContentLibrary) to learn how.  
  
3.  In the Content Library, click **Guided Task**.  
  
     ![Link to create a new Guided Task in Learning Path Content Library](../customize/media/lp-content-library-gt.png "Link to create a new Guided Task in Learning Path Content Library")  
  
4.  Provide a name and select the other settings for the Guided Task. Use this table for reference.  
  
    |Setting|Description|  
    |-------------|-----------------|  
    |**Disable this guided task**|Select this check box to disable the Guided Task. When disabled, it will not be displayed to  users.|  
    |**Make this an error guided task**|Select this check box if you want to show this Guided Task only when there is an error with other Guided Tasks, such as a lack of privileges or any issue that prevents other Guided Tasks associated with the page from being displayed.|  
    |**Name**|The name for the Guided Task that is displayed in the Content Library.|  
    |**Client**|The client value is set automatically for the platform on which you're creating content. **Warning:**  If you edit an existing control when connected to a different interface than the one on which the control was created, the Client setting will be updated to the current client type. This will cause the control to break and not work on the client for which you originally created the control. <br /><br /> If you are creating controls for the web interface, **Web client** is displayed.<br /><br /> If you are connected to the mobile app interface simulator, **Mobile apps** is displayed.<br /><br /> If you are connected to the Interactive Service Hub, **Interactive Service Hub** is displayed.|  
    |**Form factor**|The form factor displayed depends on which interface you are creating content for. If you are using the web client interface, **Desktop** and **Tablet** are displayed. When selected for the web client, **Tablet** refers to browsers running on tablet devices, not the mobile app.<br /><br /> If you are creating controls for the mobile app interface, **Tablet** is displayed. This refer to devices running the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] mobile app, but is supported only on tablets.<br /><br /> If you are using the Interactive Service Hub, **Desktop** is displayed. **Important:**  Learning Path is not supported in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] app for phones.|  
    |**Guided task opens when**|Select whether you want the Guided Task to display when the **Page Loads** or when a **Link Is Clicked** on a Sidebar.|  
    |**Lifecycle stage**|This setting is for internal use only.|  
    |**Dynamics 365 security role**|Select the security role(s) for which you want the Guided Task to be displayed. You can select as many roles as you want. If a user is assigned more than one role, the Guided Task will appear only for the role with the highest precedence, as described earlier in this topic.|

    |**Step with User action**|This step does not have a Next button. The user is prompted to click the UI element on which the step is pinned. If page redirection or any UI state change occurs as a result of this click, make sure to pin the next step on the changed UI state. Drag the tile to pin the step where you want it to appear in the app.<br /><br /> Pin this type of step to a clickable control in the UI, such as a button or link.|  
    |**User action with Next button**|This step does have a Next button. Clicking the Next button has the same effect as clicking the UI element on which the step is pinned. If page redirection or any UI state change occurs as a result of this click, make sure to pin the next step on the changed UI state. Drag the tile to pin the step where you want it to appear in the app.|

    |**Sidebar opens when**|Select whether you want the Sidebar to be displayed when the page loads, or when a user clicks a link or button on the page.|  
    |**Lifecycle stage**|This is for internal use only.|  
    |**Dynamics 365  security role**|Select the role or roles for which you want the Sidebar to be displayed to users. You can select as many roles as you want. If a user is assigned more than one role, the Sidebar will be displayed only for the role with the highest precedence, as described earlier in this topic.|  
    |**Template**|Select the template to use for the new Sidebar, either **Single Column** or **Two Column**. The default template is a single-column Sidebar.|  
    |**Status**|Displays the status of the Sidebar. The status will be **Draft** until you publish the Sidebar.|  
    |**Advanced Options**|This option is unavailable until you save the Sidebar. The following **Advanced Options** settings are available:<br /><br /> - **Disable Sidebar Header**<br />- **Disable Sidebar Title**<br />- **Disable Sidebar Footer**<br />- **Author** - Change the author defined for the Sidebar.<br />- **Tags** - Add or remove tags applied to the Sidebar.

    - **Sidebar** - create a link to an existing Learning Path Sidebar. You can use a link to a Sidebar to  
  
    - **Page in app**  
  
    - **Webpage**  
  
<a name="Videos"></a>   
## Use videos in your Learning Path controls  
 Only videos hosted on YouTube are supported in [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] controls. If you plan to use videos in your [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] controls, you'll need to have a YouTube account and channel to upload videos to. You cannot link to videos on a channel that is set to Private, but you can link to videos if your channel is set to Public or Unlisted. You can also set up your channel so that multiple people can manage the video content for your organization.  
  
 When you add videos to your controls, you can either embed the video within the control. If you want your users to view your videos in a new tab or browser window you can add a text section to your sidebar and then add a link to your video in the text section.  
  
 When you embed videos that are displayed within a Sidebar or Guided Task, you'll use the link that you get from YouTube. [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] will automatically update the link to embed the video and size it to fit in Sidebar or Guided Task tile. A user can click Full screen to view the video in full screen mode. If a user pauses the playback, or when the playback is finished, YouTube may automatically display links to other videos the user may be interested in. You can prevent this from happening by modifying the link in your control to include **?rel=0** at the end.  
  
 For example, after you create and upload a video to your channel you copy the video URL provided by YouTube, which is **https://youtu.be/4TrYMB4pjyw**. To embed this video in a control, you enter that URL into the **Enter video URL** field for your control.  
  
 When you save the control, [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] changes the URL to: **https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TrYMB4pjyw**. To turn off the display of links to other videos when the video is paused or finished playing, edit the URL to append **?rel=0** to the end so that your URL look similar to the following: **https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TrYMB4pjyw?rel=0**.  
  
 For more information on using YouTube, please see the [YouTube Help Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847120).  
  
<a name="PublishLP"></a>   
## Publish Learning Path content  
 Users will only see [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content you create after you publish it. Only content that is checked in can be published.

 [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] content is published to a publishing group. When you turn on [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] for your organization, a publishing group is created with the same name as the organization name. You can create additional publishing groups as needed. You can add multiple organizations to a publishing group, and an organization can be a member of multiple publishing groups so that you can customize content and easily publish it to different organizations.  
  
<a name="CreatePG"></a>   
### Create a publishing group

<a name="ExportandImport"></a>   
## Export and import Learning Path content  
 You can export content that you create, perhaps to share with an author of another organization, or to make backup copies. The export feature creates a compressed .zip file that contains the .json files used for your content in [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)]. There will be one folder in the .zip file for each selected [!INCLUDE[pn_learning_path](../includes/pn-learning-path.md)] Sidebar or Guided Task.  
  
<a name="ExportProc"></a>   
### Export your Learning Path content

2.  Click **Manage** at the top of the page, and then click **Export**.  
  
3.  Select the option you want to use for saving the generated .zip file, and then select a file name and location.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The default file name for the .zip file is the same each time you export, so you’ll want to use a unique name to avoid overwriting files previously exported.  
  
### Import your Learning Path content  
  
1.  In the Content Library, click **Manage** and then click **Import**.  
  
2.  Click **Browse** to select the previously exported file that you want to import, or drag the file to into the **Drag controls here** box on the dialog.  
  
    > [!CAUTION]
    >  When you import a control it will overwrite and replace any version of the same control that is already in the library, even if the existing control  is newer.  
  
3.  Confirm that the file name displayed is the file you want to import, and then click **Import**.  
  
4.  Click **OK** on the confirmation dialog.  
  
<a name="Localize"></a>   
## Localize Learning Path controls  
 You can localize the content in the controls you create in Learning Path so that they are displayed to users in the language they have selected for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)]. To localize your controls, you can simply export them, localize the strings that are displayed to users, and then import the control that includes the localized content. You can import the control into the same organization, or into another organization as desired. You can localize the same control into multiple languages and then just import the specific languages into specific organizations that support user with that language selected. Localization support in Learning Path follows the OASIS XML Localisation Interchange File Format (XLIFF) 2.0 standard. There are tools and tutorials freely available for working with this common format. For more information, see [XLIFF Version 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/v2.0/os/xliff-core-v2.0-os.html).  
  
 For more information about user language settings in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)], see [Set personal options](../basics/set-personal-options.md).  
  
1.  Select the control you want to localize in the Content Library.  
  
2.  Click **Localize** and then click **Export**.  
  
    ![Export button on the Learning Path Localization menu](../customize/media/lp-localize-export.png "Export button on the Learning Path Localization menu")  
  
3.  Select the option you want to use for saving the generated .zip file, and then select a file name and location.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The default file name for the .zip file is the same each time you export, so you’ll want to use a unique name to avoid overwriting files previously exported.  
  
4.  After you've localized the content, in the Content Library click **Localize** and then click **Import**.  
  
5.  Click **Browse** to select the previously exported file that you want to import, or drag the file to into the **Drag controls here** box on the dialog.  
  
    > [!CAUTION]
    >  When you import a control it will overwrite and replace any version of the same control that is already in the library, even if the existing control  is newer.  
  
6.  Confirm that the file name displayed is the file you want to import, and then click **Import**.  
  
7.  Click **OK** on the confirmation dialog displayed.  
  
8.  Publish the localized control to the desired publishing environments to make the localized control available to your users. The localized content will automatically be displayed to users that have selected the same language for their user interface.

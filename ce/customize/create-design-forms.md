# Create and design forms

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)], forms provide the user interface that people use to interact with the data they need to do their work. It's important that the forms people use are designed to allow them to find or enter the information they need efficiently.

## Updated entities and classic entities  
[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] provides many options for designing forms. The forms for the updated entities and custom entities include support for the [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_full](../includes/pn-moca-full.md)] client, business process flows, and business rules. When you use these entities, you can design once and deploy to all clients.  
  
There are still a number of entities (classic entities) that retain the appearance and capabilities from earlier versions. These classic entities werenâ€™t updated because they aren't used as frequently:

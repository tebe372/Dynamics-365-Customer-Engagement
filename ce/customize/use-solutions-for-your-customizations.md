# Use the default solution to customize  

[!INCLUDE [cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

 When you customize a model-driven app, you may work with the default solution. To open the default solution, open solution explorer.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  After you have the default solution open, use `Ctrl+D` to create a favorite or bookmark in your browser. This will help you open it faster even if you donâ€™t already have the web application open.  
  
 Every environment has a default solution and it has some unique properties. The default solution contains all the solution components available in your environment. Other solutions may include a subset of the solution components visible in the default solution, but the default solution contains all of them.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Before you start creating new customizations, remember to change the solution publisher customization prefix. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Solution publisher prefix](change-solution-publisher-prefix.md).

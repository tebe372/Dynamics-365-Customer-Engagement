# Manage access to apps by using security roles
You can choose what users see and access from My Apps or the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] home page by giving app access to specific security roles. Users will have access to apps based on the security roles they are assigned to.  
  
1.  Go to **Settings** > **My Apps**.  
  
2.  In the lower right corner of the app tile you want to manage access for, click the **More options** button ![More Options button in the app designer](../customize/media/apps-more-options-icon.png "More Options button in the app designer"), and then click **Manage Roles**.  
  
 ![Manage security roles for the app](../customize/media/app-manage-roles.png "Manage security roles for the app")  
  
3.  In the **Manage App** dialog box, enter the following:  
  
    1. **App URL Suffix**. The URL  you chose while creating the app is shown here by default. Enter another app URL suffix, if required. This is optional, and is used to create an easy-to-remember URL for the app. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create or edit an app](../customize/create-edit-app.md)  
  
    2. **Roles**. Choose whether you want to give app access to all security roles or selected roles. If you choose **Give access only to these roles**, select the specific security roles.  
  
    3.  Click **Save**.  
  
4.  Refresh the **My Apps** page.  
  
5.  Go to the **Apps Being Edited** view, and publish the app again.

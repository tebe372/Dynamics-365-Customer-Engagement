# Getting started with customization
You can tailor [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] to more closely fit your organization’s industry, nomenclature, and unique business processes by customizing the service. You can implement many customizations without writing any code.  
  
 The following table shows some examples of customizations.  
  
|Customization|Definition|Reason for the customization|  
|-------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|  
|Entity|An item with properties that you track, such as a contact or account. For an entity you might track properties such as *company name*, *location*, *products*, *email*, and *phone*.|Create or modify the name or properties of an entity that your organization wants to track.|
|Field|A property of an entity, such as *company name*.|Define entity properties that you want to track.|  
|Form|A set of data-entry fields for a given entity that matches the items that your organization tracks for the entity, for example, a set of data-entry fields that track a customer’s previous orders along with specific requested reorder dates.|Create a new form based on an existing form, and then customize the form to suit your organization’s needs.|
|Business process flow|An online process that walks users through a standard business process.|Standardize your business processes with the same stages and steps for each type of customer interaction. Business processes help everyone follow best practices.
|Dashboard|Provides an overview of actionable business data|Create a dashboard that provides lists and charts that shows a team's performance at a glance.
|Interface|The buttons, labels, and controls of the user interface.|If the users in your organization find the term *Commit* more familiar than the term *Go*, for example, you can change all the **Go** buttons to be **Commit** buttons.|
|Workflow|A set of rules that run on demand or are triggered to run automatically.|Create or modify workflows to run in accordance with the way your organization works. For example, a custom workflow could automatically send an email notification to an account owner when a specific condition or combination of conditions is reached.|

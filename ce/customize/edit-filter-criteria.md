# Edit filter criteria and change sort order in views

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

<a name="BKMK_EditFilterCriteria"></a>   

Along with the columns displayed in a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement view, the filter criteria applied to a view is a critical part of the value provided by the view.  
  
1.  When you create or edit the view, click **Edit Filter Criteria**.  
  
2.  The dialog shows a user interface similar to **Advanced Find**. You can use **AND** and **OR** clauses to specify and group criteria.  
  
3.  Click **OK** to close the **Edit Filter Criteria** dialog box.

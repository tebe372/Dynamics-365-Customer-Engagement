# Create or edit views (lists) 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] Customer Engagement apps, use views to define how a list of records for a specific entity is displayed in the application. A view defines:  
  
-   The columns to display  
  
-   How wide each column should be  
  
-   How the list of records should be sorted by default  
  
-   What default filters should be applied to restrict which records will appear in the list  
  
A drop-down list of views is frequently displayed in the application so that people have options for different views of entity data.  
  
 The records that are visible in individual views are displayed in a list, sometimes called a grid, which frequently provides options so that people can change the default sorting, column widths, and filters to more easily see the data thatâ€™s important to them. Views also define the data source for charts that are used in the application.

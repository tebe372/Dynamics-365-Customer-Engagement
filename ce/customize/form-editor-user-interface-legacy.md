# Overview of the form editor user interface

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

 The form editor displays commands in two ribbon tabs: **Home** and **Insert**. For details about the commands available there, see [Home tab](../customize/form-editor-user-interface-legacy.md#BKMK_HOMETab) and [Insert tab](../customize/form-editor-user-interface-legacy.md#BKMK_INSERTTab).  
  
 ![Form editor](../customize/media/crm-itpro-cust-formeditor.PNG "Form editor")  
  
 The body of the form editor is divided into three areas: **Navigation**, **Body**, and **Explorer**.  
  
 **Navigation area**  
 Located on the left side, use the navigation area to control access to related entities or to add links to web resources or URLs to be displayed in the main pane of the form. To edit navigation you must first select the **Navigation** command in the **Select** group of the **Home** tab.  
  
 Forms for [Classic forms](main-form-presentations.md#classic-forms) provide a navigation experience that is visually similar to what you see in the navigation area. Forms for [Updated entities and classic entities](create-design-forms.md#updated-versus-classic-entities) provide navigation options through the navigation bar, but use the same data to control what navigation options are available. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Edit navigation](../customize/use-the-form-editor-legacy.md)  
  
 **Body area** 
 Located in the center, use the body area to control the layout of the form. You can select and drag form elements to position them. Double-clicking on an element will open the properties for the element.  
  
-   To add a field, select it from the **Field Explorer** and drag it into a section.  
  
-   To add an element that is not a field, select where you want to place it and use the appropriate command from the **Insert** tab add it.  
  
-   To remove an element, select it and use the **Remove** command in the **Edit** group of the **Home** tab.  
  
-   To edit the **Header** or **Footer** for the form you must first select the corresponding command in the **Select** group of the **Home** tab.  
  
 **Explorer area**  
 Located on the right side, the content of the explorer area depends on the context.  
  
 When you select **Body**, **Header**, or **Footer** in the **Select** group of the **Home** tab, you’ll see the **Field Explorer**. Use the **Field Explorer** to drag fields you want to display into a section in the form or within the header or footer. You can include the same field multiple times in a form. Use the **New Field** button as a shortcut to create a new field.  
  
 When you select **Navigation** in the **Select** group of the **Home** tab you’ll see the **Relationship Explorer**. Drag any of the relationships into one of the groups within the navigation area. You cannot add the same relationship twice. Relationships are available based on how they are configured. If you configure a relationship to not display, it won’t display in the **Relationship Explorer**. For information about how to configure default display options for relationships, see [Navigation pane item for primary entity](create-and-edit-1n-relationships.md#navigation-pane-item-for-primary-entity).
  
 You can use the **New 1:N** and **New N:N buttons** as a shortcut to add new entity relationships.

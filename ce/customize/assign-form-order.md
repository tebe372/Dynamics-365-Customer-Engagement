# Assign form order

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

 When you have multiple main, quick create, or mobile forms for an entity, you can assign a form order. The form order determines which of the available forms will be shown by default. The available main or mobile forms can be further controlled by assigning security roles to forms. See [Control access to forms](control-access-forms.md) for more information.  
  
 You cannot assign security roles to quick create forms, so the only form that will be used by everyone is the one at the top of the form order.  
  
## To assign a form order  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_customization](../includes/proc-settings-customization.md)]  
  
2.  Choose **Customizations**, then choose **Customize the System**.  
  
3.  In the solutions explorer, expand the entity that you want and select **Forms**.  
  
4.  In the form list toolbar select **Form Order**.  
  
5.  Choose either **Main Form Set**, **Quick Create Form Set**, or **Mobile Form Set** depending on the type of forms you want to work with.  
  
6.  The **Form Order** dialog is a simple list where you can move a selected form up or down in the form order.  
  
7.  After you have set the order you want, click **OK** to close the dialog.

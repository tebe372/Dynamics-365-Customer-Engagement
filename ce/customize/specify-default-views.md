# Specify a default view

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

  
<a name="BKMK_SetDefaultView"></a>   

Unless someone has ‘pinned’ a different view in a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement app as their personal default, they will see the default view that you specify as a customizer. You can set any of the public views as the default view for an entity.  
  
## Set the default view for an entity  
  
1.  Navigate to **Views** as described in [Access view definitions](../customize/accessing-view-definitions.md).  
  
2.  Select a Public view.  
  
3.  On the menu bar, click **More Actions** > **Set Default**.  
  
4.  Click **Publish All Customizations**.

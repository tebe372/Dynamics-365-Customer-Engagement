# Specify a default view

[!INCLUDE [cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc-applies-to-powerapps-and-update-9-0-0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE [cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0](../includes/cc_applies_to_on-prem-9_0_0.md)]

Unless someone has ‘pinned’ a different view in your app as their personal default, they will see the default view that you specify as the app maker. You can set any of the public views as the default view for an entity.  
  
## Set the default view for an entity  
  
1.  Navigate to **Views** as described in [Access view definitions](../customize/accessing-view-definitions.md).  
  
2.  Select a public view.  
  
3.  On the menu bar, select **More Actions** > **Set Default**.  
  
4.  Select **Publish All Customizations**.

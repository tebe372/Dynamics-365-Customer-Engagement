# View your personal dashboard with the Dynamics 365 app for Microsoft Teams

## Set up the personal dashboard

1. Open the Dynamics 365 app.

2. Select an environment and a Unified Interface app to connect with customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365, and then choose **Save Changes**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

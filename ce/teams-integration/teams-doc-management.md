# Document management in Microsoft Teams integration

Document management with SharePoint lets users manage common document types, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and create folders to save and manage those documents in customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365 (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), that are seamlessly stored in SharePoint. 

To access documents between Microsoft Teams and customer engagement apps, you need explicit permission to use document management in your customer engagement app and SharePoint. For information: [Permissions required for document management tasks](Permissions required for document management tasks)



## Access to files

A userâ€™s access to files in Microsoft Teams or Dynamics 365 apps depends on their access to the SharePoint site the file is stored in.

> [!NOTE]
> - A guest user in Microsoft Teams will get error message when they try to access a pinned customer engagemnt app record. 
> - A user who is part of Microsoft Teams channel or team that does have access to customer engagementapps won't have access to the record in Microsoft Teams.

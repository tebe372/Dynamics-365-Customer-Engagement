# Document management in Microsoft Teams integration

Document management with SharePoint lets you manage common document types, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. You can also create folders to save and manage those documents in customer engagement apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), that are stored in SharePoint.

With Microsoft Teams integration with Dynamics 365, you can use document management with Microsoft Teams. It allows a user to co-author documents and automatically sync documents to customer engagement apps using SharePoint. For each tenant, there is a single SharePoint instance. Documents in Dynamics 365 and files in Microsoft Teams are all on the same SharePoint site. The subsites may be different but the root site is the same.

There isn't an automatic relationship between SharePoint permissions and permissions to customer engagement apps. To access documents between Microsoft Teams and customer engagement apps, you need explicit permission to use document management for customer engagement apps and SharePoint. For information: [Permissions required for document management tasks](../customerengagement/on-premises/admin/permissions-required-document-management-tasks.md)

Use the **Files** tab in Microsoft Teams or the **Documents** tab in your customer engagement apps, to store and manage documents in the context of a record on a SharePoint Server. Documents are stored on a SharePoint Server that allows a user on Microsoft Teams to access the documents on the SharePoint Server &ndash; as long as the user has appropriate permissions.

A user's access to files in Microsoft Teams or customer engagement apps depends on their access to the SharePoint site the file is stored in.

> [!NOTE]
> - A guest user in Microsoft Teams will get error message when they try to access a pinned customer engagemnt app record. 
> - A user who is part of Microsoft Teams channel or team that does have access to customer engagementapps won't have access to the record in Microsoft Teams.

## FAQs 


#### 1. Will guest users in Microsoft Teams have access to Dynamics 365 app records? 
No, they will see an error message when they try to access a pinned record.

#### 2. Will participants of Microsoft Teams chats and channels be able to see the pinned Dynamics 365 app record if they don't have a Dynamics 365 license?
No, they will see an error message when trying to access a pinned record.

#### 3. Can I add a document to my record if it isn't pinned to a Microsoft Teams channel?
It depends on whether your Dynamics 365 tenant has SharePoint integration set up. If you have SharePoint integration enabled, then you can add a document.

If you do not have SharePoint integration enabled, you need to have pinned the record to a Microsoft Teams channel, otherwise you will not be able to add a document to the record.

#### 4. What happens when I add documents to a Microsoft Teams channel connected to a Dynamics 365 app record and then remove a member from the channel?
It depends if the user has permissions to access the Dynamics 365 app record.

If they has permissions to access the app record, then the user can edit the record in Dynamics 365, but can't access the files from Dynamics 365, SharePoint, or Microsoft Teams.

If they don't have permission to access the Dynamics 365 app record, then the user will get an error and they won't have access to the file from Dynamics 365 , SharePoint, or Microsoft Teams

#### 5. What permissions does a user get when I add them to a Microsoft Teams channel that has pinned records and documents added to the files tab?

When adding a file from a Dynamics 365 app record that is linked to a Microsoft Teams channel, the document is stored in a SharePoint folder with the file path [Team Name] > Documents > [Channel Name] > [File Name]. The file is visible in the Microsoft Teams channel's files tab and the Dynamics 365 app record's document associated grid.

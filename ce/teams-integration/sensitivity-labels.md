# Use sensitivity labels to protect content in Microsoft Team

To get their work done, people in your organization collaborate with others both inside and outside the organization. This means that content no longer stays behind a firewallâ€”it can roam everywhere, across devices, apps, and services. And when it roams, you want it to do so in a secure, protected way that meets your organization's business and compliance policies.

Sensitivity labels in Microsoft Teams integration with customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365 (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation) let you classify and protect your organization's data, while making sure that user productivity and their ability to collaborate isn't hindered.


## Turn on Sensitivity labels

Sensitivity labels is only available when [Enhanced Collaboration Experience with Microsoft Teams](teams-collaboration-enhanced-experience) is turned on. 

1. On the lower right, go to **Change area** and then select, **App Settings**.

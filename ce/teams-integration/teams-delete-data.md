# Delete personal data from Microsoft Teams

## Delete user data
Your privacy is important to us. You can remove the personal data for customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365 (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation) from Microsoft Teams.

The following data is stored with Dynamics 365 app integration with Microsoft Teams.

|    User ID    |      The user's Azure Active Directory object ID       |  EndUsePseudonymousIdentifiers (EUPI) —<br/>An identifier created by Microsoft tied to the user of a Microsoft service. When EUPI is combined with other information, such as a mapping table, it identifies the end user. EUPI does not contain information uploaded or created by the customer.      |                                      <ul><li>User GUIDs, PUIDs, or SIDs</li><li>Session IDs</li><ul>                                      |

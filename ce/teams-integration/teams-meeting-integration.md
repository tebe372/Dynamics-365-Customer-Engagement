# Integrate Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Teams meetings (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Microsoft Teams meeting integration feature allows frontline workers (seller or customer service representatives) to quickly access and update Dynamics 365 records in Microsoft Teams before, during, and after meetings. As an administrator, you can enable this feature to empower frontline workers and accelerate business outcomes with a seamless experience between Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Teams meetings. The frontline workers can execute meetings that better meet their customerâ€™s requirements.

Additionally, sellers can use Conversation Intelligence capabilities (if enabled by their administrators) during the meeting to focus on customer conversations while the solution takes care of capturing action items and surfacing valuable business insights in real-time.

# Basic Collaboration Experience with Microsoft Teams integration

## Collaboration experience in Microsoft Teams

Once installed, the Dynamics 365 app for Microsoft Teams enables collaborating with other team members by adding a model-driven app in Dynamics 365 tab to a channel in Microsoft Teams.

### Connect a model-driven app record or view to a team channel

From a team channel, you can connect a model-driven app record or view to collaborate on any entity, such as customer accounts, opportunities, and more.

1. Open a team channel, and select the **Add** button (![Add button](media/plus-2.png "Add button")).

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select Add button](media/teams-add-tab.png "Select Add button")

2. Select the **Dynamics 365** icon to pin a model-driven app record to a channel.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Add Dynamics 365 appsTeam channel](media/teams-add-channel.png "Add Dynamics 365 appsTeam channel")

3. Select **Entity Selection**, or **View Selection**.

  - **Entity Selection**
     1. Search for an entity to connect. You can pick a recently viewed record or use search to find records. You can use **Filter by** to narrow the search to an entity type.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
        > ![Search for entity](media/teams-add-channel-pin-record2.png "Search for entity")

     2. If you are the owner of the team, you will see an option to add other members to the team who either owns the record, or it has been shared with them. When you are done, select **Save**. 
        > [!NOTE] 
        > The Enhanced Collaboration Experience needs to be enabled to add members to the team. For more information, see [Install and set up the Dynamics 365 app for Microsoft Teams](teams-install-app.md).
     
     Once you complete the above steps, you'll see a notification of a successful connection and the model-driven app record will load in the new added tab. You can interact with the record as if you were using the your app. Those with **Write** permissions can edit the record. Changes will be synchronized with the model-driven app in Dynamics 365.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
      > ![Record successfully connected and pinned](media/teams-pinned-record.png "Record successfully connected and pinned")
   

<a name="Twoconnect"></a>     
**Two connection states**

**Successful** or **Failed** are only two connection states possible when connecting model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Teams.

The successful connection state indicates that the connection was successfully saved in Dynamics 365 apps so that the link to the connected Microsoft Teams channel appears on the Dynamics 365 apps page and the files used on this channel also appear on the **Documents** tab in Dynamics 365 apps.

A failed connection state indicates that the connection was not successfully sent to Common Data Service. Microsoft Teams users can still use the pinned tab in the channel, but the relationship between the pinned record or view with the team channel is not stored in Common Data Service. For more information, see [Troubleshooting](teams-troubleshoot.md). 


 - **View Selection**
     1. Select an entity to see the list of active views that are available for the entity in the model-driven app and then select  **Save**.
  
        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
        > ![Select a view](media/teams-select-view.png "Select a view")
   
        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
        > ![Select a view](media/teams-select-view2.png "Select a view")
   
      Once you complete the above steps, you'll see the model-driven app entity view in the new added tab.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
      > ![My View in Microsoft Teams](media/teams-select-view4.png "My View in Microsoft Teams")
     
     
    > [!NOTE]
    > - If you select a personal view (**My Views**) instead of **System Views**, itâ€™s recommended that you share the view with other users in Microsoft Teams before you add the view to the Microsoft Teams channel. Otherwise, other team members will not hae access to the view content.
   
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select from My View](media/teams-select-view3.png "Select from My View")

4. If you have multiple environments or app modules, you can change the environment and app module by selecting **Edit** (![Edit](media/edit-icon.png "Edit")) to specify which environment or app module to use in Microsoft Teams.
 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Specify org and app](media/teams-change-org-app.png "Specify org and app")

You can enable **Remember this preference** to set the environment and app selections to be the default personal dashboard that appears when you select **My Dashboard**.

You can return to these settings any time by selecting the **Settings** tab.

Once the model-driven app tab is set up in Microsoft Teams collaboration channel, you can start working with your team members on the pinned app customer information and share files directly from Microsoft Teams.

### Have a conversation
You can chat with your team members side-by-side with the model-driven app tab. From the model-driven app tab pinned in a Microsoft Teams channel, select the **Show tab converation** button to open the conversation tab.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Start a conversation](media/teams-start-conversation.png "Start a conversation")


### Open a model-driven app record or view 

It's easy to navigate to the pinned model-driven app record or view page from Microsoft Teams. From the model-driven app record tab pinned in a Microsoft Teams channel, select the **Go to website** button to open the record or view page in Dynamics 365 apps.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Open a record in Dynamics 365 apps](media/teams-open-record-d365.png "Open a record in Dynamics 365 apps")


### View and associate files

Select the **Files** tab in the connected team channel to associate files with a model-driven app record. Files added here will appear in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 under **Documents** for the linked record. Likewise, when you add a document to a model-driven app record, that document will appear in Microsoft Teams under the **Files** tab.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Files tab in Microsoft Teams app](media/teams-files-tab.png "Files tab in Microsoft Teams app")
   
   
#### If you see this message: Shared files exist in multiple locations. Select "Document Location" to see files in other locations.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Shared files in multiple locations](media/teams-error-multiple-locations.png "Shared files in multiple locations")

When there is more than one Microsoft Teams channel connected to a model-driven app record, each of the channels appears as a separate document location in Common Data Service. You can switch to a different location by selecting **Document Location** to specify the location of the file.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Change document location](media/teams-change-document-location.png "Change document location")


To view a consolidated file list across all document locations including all connected team channel file libraries, from **Document Location** select **All Locations**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Document location](media/doclocation.png "Document location")


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Document location](media/doclocation1.png "Document location")



## Collaboration experience in a model-driven app

In a model-driven app, you can see the connected Microsoft Teams channel and files from the Microsoft Teams channel.

For more information on which entities support the collaborate option, see [Record types that support Microsoft Teams integration](teams-collaboration.md#record-types-that-support-microsoft-teams-integration-in-model-driven-apps).

In a model-driven app record page, select **Collaborate** to display a list of all the connected team channels. Then, select a team channel to go to the relevant channel conversation in Microsoft Teams.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![From Dynamics 365 apps, open a conversation in Microsoft Teams](media/teams-select-collaborate.png "From Dynamics 365 apps, open a conversation in Microsoft Teams")

In addition, document management in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 is integrated with Microsoft Teams. You can see the connected channel file library in the model-driven app and directly upload files; uploaded files will appear in the connected team channel file library under the **Files** tab in Microsoft Teams. Files uploaded in the Microsoft Teams connected channel will appear in the **Documents** tab in you app.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Dynamics 365 apps document management in Teams](media/teams-documents-d365.png "Dynamics 365 apps document management in Teams")

## Record types that support Microsoft Teams integration in model-driven apps

Currently, the following record types only support Microsoft Teams collaborate capabilities in model-driven app in Dynamics 365. The **Collaborate** button and file share feature will only work with the record types listed below in a model-driven app.

If not enabled, users can still connect model-driven app records to Microsoft Teams, but the connected Microsoft Teams channel and the file library do not appear in model-driven apps.

When the feature is enabled, the collaboration feature is enabled only for a selected set of system entities. If you want to enable Microsoft Teams integration for additional entities or custom entities, you can only do it programmatically using the **msdyn_SetTeamsDocumentStatus** Web API action.

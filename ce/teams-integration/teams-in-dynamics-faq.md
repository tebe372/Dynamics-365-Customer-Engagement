# FAQ on Dynamics 365 integration with Microsoft Teams 

## Who needs to provide consent for this integration?  

The tenant admin will be required to provide initial consent for the integration. After the tenant admin provides consent, an application administrator can enable the integration at the instance level.

## Which tenant admin role is required for providing consent? 

You must be a global administrator to provide consent.

## What is the scope of the consent?

Consent is given at the tenant level. It applies to all Dynamics 365 instances under the same tenant.

## What happens when consent is provided?

When the tenant admin provides consent, an enterprise application called **Dynamics 365 Microsoft Teams Collaboration Integration** is created in Azure Active Directory and permissions are given to the enterprise application. Also, a flag is set internally in Dynamics 365 to indicate that the feature is enabled. This flag controls the UI behavior, such as displaying the **Collaborate** menu in the command bar.

## After consent is provided, is Teams integration enabled for all instances?

No. After the tenant admin provides consent, a Dynamics 365 system administrator can enable the integration for any instance under the same tenant.

## What are the privileges and types of permissions required by the integration?
  
| **Permission**      | **Type**    | **What the app does with the permission**       |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Chat.ReadWrite.All  | Delegated   | Reads a user's chats and recent messages to display in the chat list.         |
| Directory.Read.All  | Delegated   | Reads the display names for user's teams and channels.     |
| Presence.Read.All   | Delegated   | Reads presence information for all users to be displayed on the user avatars in the chat list.    |
| User.Read.All       | Application | Reads the display name and licenses of users to validate whether the suggested participants have a Teams license assigned. This permission is used by the **Suggested chats & contacts** section in the chat list. The permission is set at the application level, because it's used by a background service for better performance. |
| User.ReadBasic.All  | Delegated   | Reads users' photos.  |

## Does the consent apply to other Microsoft services as well?

No. Other Office services, such as SharePoint and Exchange, don't require explicit consent because they're managed internally by Teams. 


## Will the integration in any way affect security constraints or configuration in Dynamics 365 and Teams?  

No. The integration is developed with the core principle of not violating security in any direction. Linking a chat or channel doesn't automatically grant participants of those chats or channels access to that Dynamics record.  Dynamics security roles & permissions will supersede any membership of a linked chat or channel. Similarly, the user trying to create a team or channel from the **Collaborate** experience in Dynamics 365 must have Teams permissions to do so.


## Is the Teams conversation data stored in Dynamics 365?

Only the conversation ID is stored in Dynamics 365, by using a link entity to make the connection between the record and the conversation. No conversation text is stored in Dynamics 365.

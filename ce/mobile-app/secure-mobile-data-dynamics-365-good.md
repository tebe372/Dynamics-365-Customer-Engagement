# Secure your mobile data from loss or theft

As of December 3, 2018, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Blackberry App is deprecated and will be removed from the iOS App Store on October 31, 2019. For more information, [Dynamics 365 for Blackberry is deprecated
](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming#dynamics-365-for-blackberry-is-deprecated).

[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_for_good](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)], integrated with [!INCLUDE[pn_good_dynamics](../includes/pn-good-dynamics.md)], protects your Dynamics 365 apps data even if you lose or leave your mobile device somewhere. For example, if you leave your device in a taxi cab and can’t get it back right away, your Dynamics 365 apps data is protected by [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] encryption. If you lose your device entirely, just notify your admin, who can remotely wipe your [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_for_good](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)] data from your device.  
  
 This app is intended for use only with [!INCLUDE[pn_good_dynamics](../includes/pn-good-dynamics.md)] server software and services from [!INCLUDE[pn_good_technology](../includes/pn-good-technology.md)]. If you’re not using [!INCLUDE[pn_good_dynamics](../includes/pn-good-dynamics.md)], download [!INCLUDE[pn_Mobile_Express_long](../includes/pn-mobile-express-long.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_full](../includes/pn-moca-full.md)] instead from the [Apple App store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=313645).  
  
## Download the Dynamics 365 apps for Good app  
 You can download the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_for_good](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)] app from the [Apple App store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=524762). You can also find the app on the [Good Dynamics Marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=524809).  
 
## Start and sign in to the Dynamics 365 apps for Good app  
  
1. Open the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_for_good](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)] app.  
  
2. When prompted, type in your email address and [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] access key. (If you don’t have a [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] access key, contact your [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] admin to get one.) Instead, the sign-in screen might ask for your Auth Delegate or password for other [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] apps you might have installed for easy activation.  
  
3. When prompted, select a [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] security password.  
  
4. On the **Let’s get set up!** screen, enter your company’s Dynamics 365 apps web address.

5. Tap the **Arrow** button in the lower right corner to continue.  
  
6. When prompted, type in your Dynamics 365 apps credentials.  
  
   Now that you’re signed in to the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_for_good](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)] app, check out the [Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets User's Guide](dynamics-365-phones-tablets-users-guide.md) to find out all you can do.  
  
## Accessing email and other apps through Dynamics 365 apps for Good  
 If you get an alert when you try to use email or other apps through [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_for_good](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)], your admin may be controlling communication to these apps for security purposes. Contact your [!INCLUDE[pn_good_shortest](../includes/pn-good-shortest.md)] admin to find out which apps your company uses in conjunction with [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_for_good](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-for-good.md)], along with any settings that need to be configured.

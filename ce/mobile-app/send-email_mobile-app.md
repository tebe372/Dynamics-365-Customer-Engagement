# Preview: Configure mobile offline synchronization in Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets


[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]


Set up mobile offline synchronization to allow users to work in offline mode on their mobile device. Mobile offline allows your users to use the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets in offline mode to interact with their data, even when they are not connected to the internet. The Dynamics 365 mobile app provides a rich offline experience and helps you to stay productive. You can use basic commands such as create, read, update, and delete when you are offline. Once you are back online, the changes you made on the Dynamics 365 mobile app are automatically synchronized with Common Data Service.

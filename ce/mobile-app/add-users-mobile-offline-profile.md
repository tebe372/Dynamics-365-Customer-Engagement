# Add users to a mobile offline profile
If you have already created a mobile offline profile, you can add users to the profile.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can add a user to only one mobile offline profile.  
  
1.  If it’s not already open, open the mobile offline profile you want to add users to.  
  
2.  In the **Users** area, click **+** to add a new user.  
  
3.  Click the lookup field that appears and select a user to add to this mobile offline profile.  
  
4.  When you’re done adding users, click the **Save** button in the bottom right corner of the **Mobile Offline Profile** window.

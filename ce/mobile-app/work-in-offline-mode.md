# Work offline on your mobile device

Work with your data in offline mode even when you don't have internet access. The Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app provides a rich offline experience that lets you work with commands like create, read, update, and delete along with some special commandsâ€”so you always stay productive. Once you're back online, changes you've made are synchronized with your apps in the Common Data Service environment or Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).  

> [!NOTE]
> - The mobile offline feature is only available for iOS and Android devices.
> - To use the mobile offline feature, download the latest version of the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablet app from the app store. For iOS, version 13.19043.32 or later is supported; for Android, version 4.3.19043.33 or later supported.

## Download updates to work in offline mode

When your admin has [enabled mobile offline](setup-mobile-offline-for-admin.md
), the next time you access the mobile app, you will be prompted to download offline updates. Once you download the updates, you can start using the mobile app in offline mode.

- When you see the the dialog box that asks you to download updates to work offline, choose **Update**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Download updates on your mobile device for mobile offline](media/DownloadUpdates.png "Download updates on your mobile device for mobile offline")

If you choose **Skip for now**, you will not be able to use the app in offline mode until you manually download the updates. 

### Manually download updates

1. From the nav bar, select ![Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis](../mobile-app/media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis") > **Offline Status**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Manually download updates](media/downloadupdates_1.png "Manually download updates")

2. Select **Download Customizations** to download the updates.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Download Customization](media/DownloadCustomization.png "Download Customization")

3. Once the update process starts you will see a progress indicator while the updates are being downloaded. When the download is complete, it's a good idea to verify offline mode is available.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Download updates progress bar](media/downloadingupdatesprogress.png "Download updates progress bar")

## See if offline mode is available

When updates are downloaded, you can check to see if mobile offline is available.

- From the nav bar, select ![Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis](../mobile-app/media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis") > **Offline Status**.
  
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Mobile Offline Status](../mobile-app/media/OfflineStatusSettings.png "Mobile Offline Status")   




  -  **Offline Status** tracks the offline status of the whole app, and also the status of each entity individually. When the status shows as  **Available**, it indicates offline is available and data has synced successfully.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > The status here can be **Not Available** due to an error or if you missed downloading offline updates. If the status is **Not Available** due to missing the latest offline updates, then try downloading the updates again.
   
 
  -  **Entity Status** provides the offline status of each entity individually. For the available entities, you can also track the last time the entity synced. Data is synced periodically in the background to ensure that you have access to the latest data whenever you go offline.
   
  -  **Sync time** indicates the last time your data was synced with the server.
 
     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
     > ![Mobile offline status](media/OfflineStatus.png "Mobile offline status")
 
### Check offline status from the main menu

You can also see which entities are available in offline mode from the main menu.

- From the nav bar, select ![Menu button](media/MenuButton.png "Menu button").

  -  A green Wi-Fi icon next to the entity name indicates that it is available in offline mode.
  -  A red Wi-Fi icon indicates that this entity is enabled for offline use but is not available to work in offline mode due to an error or missing updates.
  -  If no Wi-Fi icon is visible, it means your admin has not enabled the entity to use in offline mode.

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
     > ![Available entities for mobile offline](media/available_entites.png "Available entities for mobile offline")
   

## Sync conflict resolution

Conflict errors can resolved based on the settings set by the admin. If your admin has set the conflict resolution to **No**, then the data value on your client device wins and there will be no sync errors. 

If your admin has set the conflict resolution to **Yes**, then the data value on the server wins. In this case, while syncing changes to the server, you might see some errors that are automatically resolved. Client changes are overwritten by server values.


## Clear cache from the device

If you used the mobile app on a phone or tablet temporarily and want to remove all your cached data before giving the device to someone else, you need to reconfigure the app.

- From the nav bar, select ![Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis](../mobile-app/media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis")  > **User Information** > **Reconfigure**. 

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
     > ![Reconfigure](media/reconfigure.png "Reconfigure mobile app")

Reconfiguring deletes all data and metadata from the cache, however do not rely on this as a security measure.

Make sure you use the **Reconfigure** option before you sign out. If you sign in to another organization but you wanted to delete data for the previous organization that you were logged into, then you will need to sign back into that organization and use the **Reconfigure** option to delete all data and metadata from the cache.

When the record is synchronized with the app, it follows the filter rule for availability in offline mode.

## Known Issues

**Business Process Flows**: Business process flows are not supported for mobile offline. When you are offline, business process flows grids and views will not be available and business process flows will not be rendered on records that are opened in offline mode. If a record containing a business process flow was loaded prior to going offline, business process flow functions, such as move next or move previous will not work. Business process flows support the ability to branch to a different set of stages, based on conditions defined on fields of the record. In offline mode, these conditions to determine the next set of stages in the business process flows will not be evaluated.

**Qualify a lead**: When a lead created in mobile offline is qualified and when the user goes online, the business process stage will still show the  qualify stage. The user will have to manually click **Next stage** to move to the next stage.


**Views** are not supported for the following entities in offline mode: 

- Email

- Task

- Fax

- Letter

- Serviceappointment

- Campaignresponse

- Campaignactivity

- Recurringappointmentmaster

- Socialactivity

Any views that have linked entities (related entity) that are not available offline are also not supported.

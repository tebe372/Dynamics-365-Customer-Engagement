# How to migrate from Dynamics 365 phones and tablets app to the Power Apps mobile app 

Users on the Dynamics 365 phones and tablets app can now use the [Power Apps mobile app](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/run-canvas-and-model-apps-on-mobile).

Once you install Power Apps mobile, find and run your app and make sure it works properly.

Follow the steps below to ensure a smooth transition to the new app.


1. Download Power Apps from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/powerapps/id1047318566?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.msapps) onto an iPhone, iPad, or Android device running a [supported operating system](../maker/canvas-apps/limits-and-config.md). 

2. Open Power Apps on your mobile device and sign in by using your Azure Active Directory credentials. If you have the Microsoft Authenticator app installed on your mobile device, simply enter your username when prompted, and then approve the notification sent to your device.

3. When you sign in to the app, the **My apps** filter is set by default. If you don't find the app you're looking for, you can open the **Power Apps** menu, and then select a different filter.

4. To run your app select the app tile. Then test your app and make sure everything is working. For more information on how to use Power Apps mobile, see [User guide for model-driven apps running on the Power Apps mobile app](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/use-custom-model-driven-app-on-mobile).


> [!NOTE]
> The Dynamics 365 phones and tablets app always opened the recent app that you used. The Power Apps mobile app works differently in that it opens the list of apps that you have access to and you can select the app that you want to use. Or, you can pin the app that you use most on your home screen. For more information, see [Pin an app to the home screen](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/run-canvas-and-model-apps-on-mobile#pin-an-app-to-the-home-screen).

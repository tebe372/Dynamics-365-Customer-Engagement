# How to migrate from Dynamics 365 phones and tablets app to the Power Apps mobile app 

Users on the Dynamics 365 phones and tablets app can now use the [Power Apps mobile app](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/run-canvas-and-model-apps-on-mobile).

It is recommended that you install Power Apps mobile app and test it out to make sure your apps work with Power Apps mobile. Follow the step below to ensure a smooth transation to the new app.


1. Download Power Apps from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/powerapps/id1047318566?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.msapps) onto an iPhone, iPad, or Android device running a [supported operating system](../maker/canvas-apps/limits-and-config.md). 

2. Open Power Apps on your mobile device, and sign in by using your Azure Active Directory credentials.

  If you have the Microsoft Authenticator app installed on your mobile device, simply enter your username when prompted, and then approve the notification sent to your device.

3. When you sign in to the app, the **My apps** filter is set by default. If you don't find the app you're looking for, you can open the **Power Apps** menu, and then select a different filter.

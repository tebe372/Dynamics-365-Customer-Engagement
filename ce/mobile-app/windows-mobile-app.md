# Basic navigation for Dynamics 365 mobile app for Windows

Use the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn-365_phones](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn-365_tablets](../includes/pn-dyn-365-tablets.md)] apps for your sales, customer service, field service, and other tasks when you're on the go. With one download from your app store, you’ll automatically have access to all the apps you need for your role. You will see apps with the new Unified Interface on your mobile device.  

> [!NOTE]
> - On February 21, 2018, we announced the deprecation of the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn-365_phones](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)] Windows Phone app. Effective May 22, 2018, the Windows Phone app is no longer supported. Support for the  app on Windows tablets and PCs remains unchanged. The Windows Phone app will continue to be available in the store and will be supported for Dynamics 365 apps, (version 8.2) and earlier supported versions. If you want to continue to use the Windows Phone app, you should not update to Dynamics 365 apps, version 9.0 as the Windows Phone app will not be supported with version 9.x. 
> - There are separate mobile apps for [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)] and Operations. More information: [Field Service mobile app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=846157) and [Finance and Operations mobile app](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/mobile-apps/mobile-app-home-page).  
> - Mobile offline feature is now available for iOS and Android users.
> - You can use web browsers on your tablet to run your model-driven apps, but for full functionality and optimized experience we strongly recommend that you use the Dynamics 365 for tablets app. Using the web browser on your phone to run your model-driven apps isn't supported; you must use the Dynamics 365 for phones app. More information: [What's supported](support-phones-tablets.md).
    
## Install the app from your device’s app store

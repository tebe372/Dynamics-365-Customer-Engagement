# Publish a mobile offline profile
To make a mobile offline profile available to users so they can get the mobile offline experience you've defined for them, you need to publish the profile.  
  
1.  If it’s not already open, open the mobile offline profile you want to publish.  
  
2.  When you’re done adding users and making any other changes to the mobile offline profile, click **Publish** so the data you specified can start syncing with your users’ mobile devices.  
  
> [!TIP]
> **Solution export and import**  
>   
>  When exporting a solution that includes mobile offline synchronization, always select the **Include entity metadata** check box for each entity you export.  
>   
>  After importing the solution into the target organization, publish all mobile offline profiles.

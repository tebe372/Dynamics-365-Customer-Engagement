This makes it easy to capture info about inventory and other issues when you're out in the field. You'll need to ask your admin to set this feature up for you.

the call.

## Relationship Assistant

The relationship assistant is designed to deliver the most important and relevant information in relation to what you are doing right now. The assistant works by analyzing all of the data at its disposal and generating a collection of action cards, each of which includes a message summarizing what the card is about, plus a set of links for taking action. The assistant sorts the cards by priority and filters them for your current context.

The assistant reminds you of upcoming activities; it evaluates your communications and suggests when it might be time to reach out to a contact that’s been inactive for a while; it identifies email messages that may be waiting for a reply from you; it alerts you when an opportunity is nearing its close date; and much more.

When you start your day by signing in to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps, the assistant draws your attention to your most important items and tasks, drawn from all areas of the application.

1.  To access the assistant, on the nav bar, tap ![Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps ellipsis](../mobile-app/media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps ellipsis").

2.  Tap **Relationship Assistant**.

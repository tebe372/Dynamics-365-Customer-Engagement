# Overview of Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets 

Use the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn-365_phones](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn-365_tablets](../includes/pn-dyn-365-tablets.md)] apps for your sales, customer service, field service, and other tasks when you're on the go. With one download from your app store, you’ll automatically have access to all the apps you need for your role. You will see apps with the new Unified Interface on your mobile device.  

> [!NOTE]
> - You can use the web browsers on your phone or tablet to run your Dynamics 365 apps but for full functionality and optimized experience, we strongly recommend that you use the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app. For more information, see [Install Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets](install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets.md).
> - There are separate mobile apps for [!INCLUDE[pn_field_service](../includes/pn-field-service.md)] and Operations. More information: [Field Service mobile app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=846157) and [Dynamics 365 for Unified Operations mobile app](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/mobile-apps/mobile-app-home-page).

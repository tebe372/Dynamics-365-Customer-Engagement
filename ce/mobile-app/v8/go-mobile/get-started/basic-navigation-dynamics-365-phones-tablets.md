# Basic navigation in Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets
## The menu  
 When you want to view all of your accounts, contacts, leads, or other records, use the menu.  
  
 Tap the menu icon on the top of the page, then select the type of record you want to work with.

## The command bar  
 You can add a new record, change views, or do other tasks from the command bar.  
  
 Just tap ![Dynamics 365 ellipsis](../../../media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 ellipsis") on the bottom right-hand corner of the page.  
  
 You can also press and hold an item to display the command bar.

 The command bar is context-sensitive, and the available commands change depending on where you are in the app. When you display the command bar for a specific item (when you press and hold the item), the commands that appear are relevant to that item.

# Reconfigure Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets

## Reconfigure the Dynamics 365 for tablets app  
 Reconfiguring deletes all data and metadata from the cache, though you shouldn't rely on this as a security measure.  
  
 If you sign out of one organization and sign in to another, and then use the Reconfigure option on the organization you signed in to, your metadata will still remain for the organization you signed out of. To remove your metadata from the organization you signed out of, youâ€™ll need to sign in to it and use the Reconfigure option there, as well.  
  
 Here's how to do it:  
  
1. Tap ![Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis](../../../media/mobile-ellipsis.png "Dynamics 365 apps ellipsis").  
  
2. Tap **Settings**.  
  
3. Tap **Reconfigure**.  
  
   You can now sign in to a different server or organization.
